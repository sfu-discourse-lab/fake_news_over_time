http://www.politifact.com/arizona/statements/2016/may/13/blog-posting/popular-internet-story-claims-arizona-missouri-and/,"Residents of multiple states will be asked to surrender their ‘third pet’ to the Humane Society to remain in compliance with a newly passed ordinance.

The ordinance was officially passed this week by state politicians in Texas, Arizona, and Missouri. According to statistics gathered and published by The Humane Society of the United States, abandoned pet rates have sky-rocketed in Texas, Arizona, and Missouri over the past 2 years.

State representatives from Texas, Arizona, and Missouri are hopeful that this new ordinance will drastically reduce the amount of abandoned pets within their respective states.

Statistics continue to show that local Humane Society shelters throughout Texas, Arizona, and Missouri, do not have the proper size of facilities to house the animals at the high rate they are receiving them. This leads to thousands of animals being euthanized almost immediately, which in-turn is costly for the tax-payer.


 
State officials from Texas, Arizona, and Missouri have partnered with The Humane Society of the United States, to re-locate all surrendered or displaced pets to shelters throughout the country including Humane Society shelters in New Mexico, Utah, California, Oklahoma, and Kansas, where they will be included and involved in special adopt-a-pet campaigns.

According to state representatives, pet owners within Texas, Arizona, and Missouri are expected to be in compliance with the new ordinance by September 2016. All pet owners are expected to surrender any pets in excess of the mandatory ‘2-pet maximum’ to their local Humane Society shelter by the compliance date of September 3rd 2016.

State officials are classifying a ‘pet’ as a “domestic animal the size of a cat or larger”. This means that if a family has 2 dogs and 1 cat, they must choose between housing the 2 dogs or housing 1 dog and 1 cat. They then must surrender the 3rd pet to their local Humane Society shelter.

According to representatives involved with the initiative, a state funded, mandatory ‘pet registration’ process will be implemented as early as January 2017. This process will require all pet owners to register their pets with the state. If a pet owner is found with an unregistered pet or pets in excess of the mandatory ‘2 pet maximum’, the pet will be immediately removed from the home and the homeowner will be required to pay a fine in excess of $500.

In addition to state officials relying on its citizens to report any instances of neighbors that fail to remain compliant with the ordinance (according to representatives, an incentive program may be implemented to encourage citizens to report those out of compliance), The Humane Society of the United States is planning to hire an additional 1,300 employees within Texas, Arizona, and Missouri to patrol and enforce the ordinance.

As the September 3rd 2017 compliance date approaches, state officials are asking impacted pet owners to begin thinking about which 2 animals they wish to continue housing."
http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2016/aug/05/dianne-feinstein/feinsteins-claim-about-prime-time-marijuana-tv-ads/,"Sacramento, CA - United States Senator Dianne Feinstein is adding her name to the growing list of California organizations and leaders opposing Proposition 64, the legalization of recreational marijuana.

 

In opposing the initiative Senator Feinstein made the following statement, ""Proposition 64 is substantially different from legalization measures in other states and would repeal countless consumer protections just passed last year and signed into law by Governor Brown. It rolls back anti-smoking advertising protections we’ve had for decades and allows marijuana smoking ads in prime time, on programs with millions of children and teenage viewers. 

 
""The AAA Foundation for Highway Safety reports that deaths in marijuana-related car crashes have doubled since Washington state approved legalization. Yet incredibly, Proposition 64’s proponents refused to include a DUI standard for marijuana, making it extremely difficult to keep impaired drivers off our highways. I urge California voters to oppose Prop 64.""
Senator Feinstein is joined in her opposition by numerous statewide organizations and a bipartisan group of leaders from across California. For more information about the No On Prop. 64 - They Got It Wrong, Again campaign please go to www.NoOn64.net

http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/aug/22/john-moorlach/has-crime-been-getting-worse-jerry-brown-was-elect/,"We should anticipate black and gray markets in fuel, now that the Legislature has approved a cap-and-trade gasoline tax increase, estimated by the Legislative Analyst’s Office as much as 73 cents a gallon, plus the 12-cent increase from the gas-tax hike passed earlier this year.

A gray market is legal, but not officially sanctioned. The black market already is here.

“Organized crime gangs are buying hundreds or thousands of gallons of diesel fuel, and reselling them to make an untraceable profit,” NPR reported in 2014. Such crime is prevalent, Glendale police Officer Dan Suttles told the network.

In April 2012, then-Los Angeles Controller Wendy Gruel reported $7 million in missing city gasoline. That led a reader to contact the police about a city gardener, who later was arrested for allegedly selling thousands of dollars of city-owned gasoline on the black market, the Los Angeles Times reported.

One can’t predict how much gas and diesel thefts could rise, but the tax increase coming in November may give an indication of what will happen when the new cap-and trade tax takes effect.

April’s $2 boost to the price of a pack of cigarettes changed behaviors. An LAO report noted that in the two months before the tax increase took effect, tobacco tax revenue ran 24 percent and 37 percent above 2016 levels.

But the extra revenue was quickly snuffed out. The May 2017 cigarette tax revenues dropped 64 percent from May 2016. According to the report, some cigarettes could be coming from states with taxes lower than California’s.

Crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor. The Bee reported, three-quarters of California’s largest cities saw violent crime rise in 2015, with Sacramento’s up 25 percent.

When fuel is contraband, the perpetrator makes a quick profit and pays no cap-and-trade or other taxes of any kind. Before the gasoline tax hike comes on Nov. 1, I would recommend buying a lock for your gas tank.

http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/dec/14/travis-allen/travis-allen-claims-californias-gas-tax-increase-w/,"As a ballot initiative calling for repeal of a big gas-tax hike gains momentum in California, Gov. Jerry Brown (D) criticized the campaign, calling its supporters freeloaders. Brown signed Senate Bill 1 into law on April 28, increasing the states excise tax on gasoline to 40 cents per gallon, a 12 centor approximately 43 percenthike, starting on November 1. On May 4, State Assemblyman Travis Allen (R-Huntington Beach) filed paperwork to begin collecting signatures to ask voters in 2018 to overturn the gas tax. Speaking of the campaign, Brown told the Orange County Register on May 12, The freeloadersIve had enough of them. To place the question before voters in November 2018, supporters will have to collect 63,593 valid signatures by October 1. Motor Voter Power Allen, the lawmaker leading the repeal campaign, says Browns gas-tax hike insults taxpayers. Jerry Brown is telling Californians hes going to raise their gas taxes to the highest theyve ever been in history, and to top it off, he calls anyone who doesnt want to pay the tax a freeloader, Allen said. When he ran in 2010, his direct quote was no new taxes without voter approval. Solving the Wrong Problem Browns gas-tax hike will not solve the states traffic problems, Allen says. This new gas tax does not increase [road] capacity anywhere in the state, Allen said. It will build no new lanes of freeways. If Californians didnt like their traffic before, theyre going to like it even less when theyre stuck in the exact same traffic and paying more for their gas. Road Money for Roads David Spady, state director for the California chapter of Americans for Prosperity, says California should use existing road funds for roads only, before taking more money from taxpayers. California doesnt need more money for roads; it needs laws mandating that existing gas taxes and heavy-vehicles tax revenue is only spent on roads and infrastructure, Spady said. The legislature cant help but raid these funds for other purposes. If current gas taxes and weight levies were spent the way they were supposed to be spent over the past couple of decades, the state road system would be in far better shape. Highway Robbery Spady says California lawmakers used road funds as slush funds for their pet projects in the past, causing todays problems. Californias roads are a disaster because for years politicians have kicked the can down the road, diverted funds to projects like bike paths and trains, and allowed a bloated government pension system to crowd out funds that could have been used for infrastructure and repair, Spady said."
http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/may/09/judy-chu/rape-pre-existing-condition-under-gop-bill-calif-c/,"WASHINGTON, DC  The House of Representatives today voted 217-212 to pass H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Initial estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the underlying legislation will take away coverage from 24 million Americans over the next decade, including seven million Americans currently covered by their employers. The bill cuts $838 billion from Medicaid, and will dramatically increase out-of-pocket costs, particularly for lower-income families and older Americans. An ""age tax"" imposed on those ages 50-64 will force this age group to pay up to five times as much as a younger person for coverage. It also completely defunds Planned Parenthood for one year, further restricting low-income womens access to affordable healthcare for pregnancy tests, cancer screening, and family planning. All of these cuts to middle class Americans health care are used to finance a $1 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest families, insurance companies, and insurance executives. The version that passed today was amended to allow states to create high risk pools instead of requiring insurance companies to cover those with pre-existing conditions. Rather than protecting those with pre-existing conditions, high-risk pools leave sick people vulnerable to skyrocketing costs, long waiting lists, and annual or lifetime caps. The bill also allows states to opt out of requirements to cover essential health benefits, like doctor and emergency room visits, mental health services, and prescription drugs. Rep. Chu voted against the bill and released the following statement: I am incredibly saddened and outraged that Republicans ignored the expressed opposition from doctors, hospitals, patient advocates, health experts and even members of their own party to pass this heartless bill. It is unconscionable to me that they would charge ahead with  and then celebrate  a vote that they know will force millions off their insurance and raise prices for people with preexisting conditions. Worse, their rush to vote on this bill meant there wasnt even time for the Congressional Budget Office to score the fiscal and human costs of the final version. The haste to act and then immediately hop on a bus to the White House shows that they were more concerned with helping Trump keep a campaign promise than with actually improving healthcare. This bill will have serious consequences for the people of California in particular. One provision of this bill would deny subsidies to any healthcare plan that covers abortion. Meaning that in California, where all plans are required to cover abortion, healthcare costs will rise astronomically because Californians will be ineligible for tax credits. This bill also threatens to kick 7 million veterans off their insurance, shortens the life of Medicare, allows people aged 50-64 to be charged 5 times more than young people, and eliminates coverage for 24 million Americans, including nearly 2 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders across the country. It defunds Planned Parenthood for one year, and would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition. This bill creates a 'womens tax' that would permit insurance companies to charge women more than men for essential coverage like pregnancy. Trumpcare would cut $838 billion from Medicaid, endangering care for individuals with disabilities, low-income children, and seniors in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. In the midst of the worst opioid epidemic our nation has ever seen, it rips mental health and addiction services away from those who need it most. Trumpcare does all this while giving the 400 richest families in America an annual tax break of $2.8 million. As we have said in the past, Democrats remain willing and eager to work to improve the Affordable Care Act. But this was not an improvement. This was a cruel attack on vulnerable Americans, especially those with preexisting conditions. An improvement is a plan that will increase access for all Americans, keep costs down, and ensure that being sick or a woman or a senior is not an excuse to be denied coverage."

Melendez (R-Lake Elsinore) released the following statement today in response to Governor Browns May Revision of his 2017-18 budget proposal: This budget is a perfect Democrat con job. After forcing a multi-billion dollar, potentially illegal, tax increase on all Californians, with the promise of better roads, Governor Brown and his fellow Democrats are already diverting funding to their own pet projects. In this budget proposal, they are diverting 30 percent of funding from the gas tax to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons. Thats money from the very gas tax the Democrats promised would go solely to fixing our decrepit roads and providing relief for traffic congestion. I hope all Californians will take action and start demanding accountability with their tax dollars from the Democrats who run this state.

http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/nov/01/john-cox/does-california-spend-nearly-five-times-much-build/,"Recently, a group of special interests threatened those daring to propose repeal of the California Democrats $5.2 billion-a-year gas-and-car tax increases. Members of the California Republican congressional delegation and taxpayer protection advocates, including the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, the National Tax Limitation Committee and taxfighter Carl DeMaio, are refusing to back down. They have pledged to take the gas tax repeal to the ballot. I, for one, commend their courage in taking on crony capitalism and the corruption that it breeds. For too long, we have permitted the Democrats to masquerade as the defenders of the poor. They are anything but. This enormous tax at the gas pump, along with the special-interest-driven cap-and-trade tax and huge increase in the vehicle license fee, together constitute an enormous, regressive tax increase. These taxes hit the working poor particularly hard, forcing families to choose between gas in the tank to get to work, or rent, or food on the table. The California Democratic leadership has been at war not only with working families but with small businesses, as well. Through overregulation and the worlds second-highest capital gains tax, California politicians have killed tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, and driven employers out of state. But worst of all, their socialist policies have created the worst poverty rate in the nation, penalizing the very people they pretend to protect. The money robbed from California families will be wasted by the California Department of Transportation, one of the worst-run bureaucracies in the country. In awarding Caltrans its 2016 Golden Fleece Award, the Independent Institute called Caltrans irresponsible for wasting billions of taxpayer dollars and said it even lied to lawmakers to cover its tracks. California spends 4.7 times the national average for every mile of roadway we build and maintain, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Texas, for example, has far better roads on which it spends about $1 for every $5.80 spent by California taxpayers. In Arizona, 80 percent of that work goes out to competitive bidding, but in California, the figure is only 10 percent. Is it any wonder when a government monopoly does the job, it costs more and takes longer? We also routinely discriminate against small business and nonunion workers, which explains why unions and big business joined together to finance an extensive radio-and-newspaper campaign to promote the gas and car tax increase. The corrupting influence of the special interests is hurting all of us, including taxpayers and especially the working poor. It has made California unaffordable for most working families and given us one of the worst small-business climates in the country. By putting crony capitalism on notice, our Republican congressional delegation is showing what real leadership is all about, and in so doing, laying the groundwork for the resurgence of a Republican Party that takes its principles seriously. John Cox of San Diego is a businessman and Republican candidate for governor. He is the chairman of Give Voters a Voice, the gas-tax repeal effort."
http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/sep/15/dana-rohrabacher/rohrabacher-repeats-bogus-claim-democrats-orchestr/,"COSTA MESA, Orange County  It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabachers Orange County home. The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet, sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill. Later, he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $10. Then again, Ronald Reagans 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy. Hes a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement, and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that Putin pays him. He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were a total hoax. Hes both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops. During our visit, he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called Individual Man. If youre a Democrat, youre thinking, How is this guy still holding office in California? Standing at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets, Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats, who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats. Theyre focused on districts like Rohrabachers, where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch. It wont be that easy. Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school, wealthier, whiter, conservative, still- lovin-the-Gipper part of the OC. Hes run for Congress 15 times, and hes won by more than 20 percent 13 times. Call him fringe-y, but hes conservative OC kind of fringe-y. Thats why, if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout, midterm election that favors Republicans, Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said hes not worried about Dana at all. And it doesnt hurt that Republicans have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District. Still, Rohrabacher acknowledges, this race will be the toughest. Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him, including two who are raising serious money. Because, he said, of Russia. Rohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But what about the high confidence with which the nations top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election? Total bull, Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches  his favorite meal  that he slapped together in his kitchen. Ive read those reports and theyre full of weasel words. That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing: To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election, he said. One of Rohrabachers sources: Assange. Last summer, on his own dime, Rohrabacher visited Assange, who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England. Rohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasnt involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released, but didnt say who was. Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck, as they used to say in my grandpas neighborhood. Rohrabacher isnt buying that conspiracy theory, but hes deep into another  that Democrats were behind last months white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va. Oh, and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit, he said. Its all baloney, Rohrabacher said. Under Rohrabachers scenario, a former Hillary and Bernie supporter got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there. It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors, Rohrabacher said. It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation and to put our president on the spot. Those of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones, host of Info Wars, will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes, which is Pants on Fire groundless, according to the nonpartisan Politifact. Meanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable. Several credible, well-financed Democrats, including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead, have lined up to take him on. Keirstead raised $138,504 shortly after jumping into the race, according to the latest federal filing information, and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $319,335. Three of the Democrats, including Rouda, were once Republicans, which could play well in the OC. Plus, theres an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district, with regular protests outside Rohrabachers office. Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman  and not in a good way. People saw incumbent and an R by his name, so they assumed that he supported Republican values, said Aaron McCall, who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible. Dana Rohrabacher doesnt support Republican values. He supports his own values. Republicans tell me We didnt realize he was this unhinged. Rohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays, playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets. But he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia, two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone. And that is what is making Rohrabacher do something hes rarely done in his career, something truly surreal. Hes seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign  so far hes raised $508,712.

http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2018/feb/05/phil-ting/false-claim-gop-tax-plan-nothing-more-middle-class/,"SACRAMENTO  California lawmakers are targeting the expected windfall that companies in the state would see under the federal tax overhaul with a bill that would require businesses to turn over half to the state. A proposed Assembly Constitutional Amendment by Assemblymen Kevin McCarty, D-Sacramento, and Phil Ting, D-San Francisco, would create a tax surcharge on California companies making more than $1 million so that half of their federal tax cut would instead go to programs that benefit low-income and middle-class families. Trumps tax reform plan was nothing more than a middle-class tax increase, Ting said in a statement. It is unconscionable to force working families to pay the price for tax breaks and loopholes benefiting corporations and wealthy individuals. This bill will help blunt the impact of the federal tax plan on everyday Californians by protecting funding for education, affordable health care, and other core priorities. Now Playing: As a constitutional amendment, the bill would require approval from two-thirds of the Legislature to pass, a difficult hurdle now that Democrats have lost their supermajority. If passed and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, it would then go to voters for final approval. Democrats lost their supermajority following resignations of two Assembly Democrats, Matt Dababneh of Encino (Los Angeles County), and Raul Bocanegra of San Fernando Valley (Los Angeles County) amid sexual misconduct allegations. Another Assembly Democrat, Sebastian Ridley-Thomas of Los Angeles, resigned citing health issues. In the Senate, Democrat Tony Mendoza of Artesia (Los Angeles County) is taking a leave of absence pending an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations. California Democrats have been exploring ways to help those in the state who could end up paying higher federal taxes next year under the Republican tax overhaul. The GOP overhaul caps state income taxes and local property tax write-offs on the federal income tax return at $10,000, a move expected to hurt high-local-tax states such as California, where the average state and local tax write-off in 2016 was $22,000. State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Len introduced legislation this month that would allow Californians to get around the state and local tax cap with a voluntary donation to a charitable fund created by the state of any amount of owed taxes above $10,000. That donation  in lieu of taxes  would allow donors to write off the gifts on their federal tax returns. Melody Gutierrez is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/apr/06/paula-dockery/dockery-says-sb-6-would-not-allow-teachers-return-/,"Had Senate Bill 6 simply rewarded exceptional teachers with extra pay, I would have supported it. Had it simply phased out tenure for new and existing teachers, I would have voted in its favor. Had it actually offered a way to remove bad teachers, I would have signed on as co-sponsor. But as I have found so often in public life, the devil is in the details. And on close examination, SB 6 violates my core conservative principles - less government, more personal responsibility and lower taxes. I believe any good education reform effort should include teachers in the challenge, not shut them out when big decisions are made. In particular, I opposed SB 6 because: - SB 6 is a Tallahassee power grab. Sponsors want to take local control of teacher evaluations, salaries and budgets away from Florida's 67 elected school boards and give it to a Tallahassee bureaucracy. This violates Florida constitutional protections of local control for local schools and redirects local decision making to Tallahassee. We don't need any more Tallahassee one-size-fits-all solutions for our communities or our schools. - We can't afford SB 6.SB 6's passage and implementation was contingent on Florida receiving another $900 million in federal stimulus funds - borrowed money that the United States Department of Education denied to Florida just last Monday. Serious fiscal questions remain as to how we will pay for this new state government program that requires the Florida Department of Education to hold back 5 percent of a local school district's funding every year. To avoid classroom cuts, school districts will have no option but to raise local taxes. Classroom funding should not be used to grow a new and bigger Tallahassee bureaucracy on the backs of taxpayers. - SB 6 will destroy jobs. The bill makes it nearly impossible for someone not currently teaching to renew his or her teaching certificate. Teachers will not be able to return to work after raising their children. They will have their certifications threatened if they are activated for military duty, or otherwise unavailable to teach, for longer than one school year. And if a teacher can't show yet-to-be-defined ""learning gains"" for four out of five consecutive years, the teacher will lose his or her license, and ability to make a living. What is not clear is what such learning gains will include or whether they will be measured on a student-by-student competitive basis, a teacher-by-teacher basis, an averaged-group basis or individual year-by-year-gains basis. The bill leaves fleshing out its critical components and practicalities to rulemaking to a Tallahassee government agency without providing meaningful guidelines or procedural protections, rendering the bill an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. - SB 6 takes a blame-the-teacher approach instead of recognizing that individuals have personal responsibility for their decisions and behaviors. The sponsors put all responsibility for student performance on teachers, failing to hold parents or students personally responsible for their own roles in the education process. What if kids don't come to school willing or able to learn? What if they don't come to school at all? Teachers face all penalties without regard to factors outside of their control or influence. - SB 6 denigrates the teaching profession and our public schools. It's demoralizing to ask teachers to defend their teaching certificates and jobs each year, and it's patently unfair to base half their pay on how well students perform on a single test. Our best teachers won't want to work where we need them the most: in lower-performing schools or in classrooms with special-need students. - SB 6 is more cloak-and-dagger, Tallahassee politics as usual. The bill's sponsors are refusing to allow any amendments that might make the bill better. Instead, they are holding secret meetings and urging that the bill be passed without any amendment, or teacher input. This is not how reasonable people make sound public policy. This is politics as usual in Tallahassee. And that has to stop. In an open forum with public debate and input, we can do better than this bill. Rewarding good teachers with good pay is good policy. But disguising an unfunded, $900 million dollar Tallahassee power grab of our local public schools as public-education reform, is not.

“Once again, Charlie Crist has put politics ahead of principled policy-making. Not only would this commonsense measure have provided women with vital information as they make a critical decision, but now Governor Crist’s veto also clears the way for taxpayer funding of abortion in Florida. This veto will now make it harder for Florida to fight Obamacare, since the bill would have enabled our state to opt out of the abortion coverage mandate in the federal health care law.

“Even those who agree with the outcome of the Governor’s decision should be alarmed that an issue as serious and deserving of sober deliberation as this one was treated in such a calculating, political manner. Florida deserves a U.S. senator who will think issues through and let principles, not the politics of the moment, guide their decisions. Not surprisingly, his latest decision is only the latest in a long litany of examples in which Charlie Crist has broken his word to Floridians.”"

For Crist to win the United States Senate race, he would need a formula that looked something like this: 33% of the Democratic vote 33% of the Republican vote 50% of the NPA vote. This formula would get him a vote total of 36-37%, a likely win scenario in a highly competitive three way race, where all three candidates are scoring in the thirties. Here is one problem: Rubio is limiting him to 20% of the Republican vote. If Rubio keeps him at 20% of the GOP vote, Crist needs to get 45% of the Democratic vote in order to win, and according to the latest PPP poll, Crist is only at 38% today with Democrats. But the bigger problem is he is falling into the same place as many other long time office holders: his personal approval numbers are plummeting. He no longer has that deep well of cross party lines personal support built up that allows him to transcend normal political divides. Instead, he now has to block and tackle like everyone else. In this political environment, absent some significant and unfortunate event that would thrust him back into the spotlight, the odds of him finding 15-20 points of political approval in the next nine weeks are slim, at best. Therefore, for Crist, who after 20 years of being a GOP insider, his only path to victory is to find a way to be Democratic enough to win enough Democrats, Republican enough to win enough Republicans, and to do that in a way where he doesn't anger Independents. Not exactly the easiest thing to do, when Democrats now have a plausible alternative in Meek and Republicans in Rubio. If Greene had won, it might be a different story. Democrats who support Crist keep saying to me, ""well, we just need Dems to vote for Crist,"" but that just isn't going to happen in the margins he needs to win. Today, Rubio has the clearest path to victory, but once Democrats figure out that Meek is their only option, his path will get much more clear as well. For Crist, I wouldn't rush to book that early January plane ticket from Tallahassee to DC-- a trip that starting in October 2010, the rest of us will be able make without stopping in Atlanta or Charlotte!"
http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/jun/14/adam-hasner/adam-hasner-cites-cbo-says-health-care-law-cuts-80/,"Former state House Majority Leader Adam Hasner, now running in a crowded Republican primary to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in 2012, came out swinging against the federal health-care law backed by President Barack Obama. On Wednesday morning, noting that oral arguments would begin in the constitutional challenge launched by Florida and other states against the law, Hasner insisted the health-care law was undermining economic recovery. ""Today, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeal in Atlanta will hear oral arguments from 26 states seeking to overturn President Obama and Senator Bill Nelson's unconstitutional health-care takeover. Led by Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, the states have already won significant legal victories against this overreach by the federal government, said Hasner. ""Attorney General Bondi is right to focus on the need for states to protect and defend the individual liberties of their citizens, as well as preserve the constitutional principle of limited government. But there is an important economic component to defeating Obamacare, as well. ""Implementation of Obamacare has played a major role in prolonging our country's economic challenges. Earlier this year, the head of the Congressional Budget Office testified before Congress that implementation of Obamacare would cost 800,000 jobs. Here in Florida, nearly 1 million Floridians are already out of work and the myriad regulations, taxes, and rules contained in Obamacare have only caused more worry and hesitation among the small-business men and women and job creators I've met with during the past three months, added Hasner. ""Individual liberty and limited government are paramount toward the defeat of Obamacare, but we should also never forget the incredible toll this massive overreach of government will take on our economic freedoms, as well. Getting Florida and America back to work requires expanding economic freedoms, and getting Washington regulations out of the way of job creators. There's no better place to start than by defeating Obamacare in the courts and repealing it in Congress."""
http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/may/23/kurt-browning/flexibility-early-voting-means-possibly-less-hours/,"One of my most important responsibilities as secretary of state in Florida is preserving the integrity of the voting process while increasing access to the ballot box. The right to vote is one of the most obvious symbols of our nation's freedom. Americans must have confidence in the electoral process we use to choose our local, state and national leaders.

Legislators also take this responsibility seriously, and both the House and Senate sent an important reform bill to Gov. Rick Scott, who signed it into law Thursday. The new law makes early voting more accessible now than ever before, by expanding the number of hours that election supervisors can open early voting sites — from just eight hours before, to 12 hours a day.

To combat voter fraud, reduce the burden on poll workers and provide needed flexibility to local election supervisors, the number of days polls remain open has been reduced from 14 possible days to eight days, even as the total number of hours available for early voting will remain the same.

The result is that working voters will be able to vote before or after work, something they haven't been able to do in the past. That added flexibility will enable more people than ever to take advantage of early voting. And, if an election supervisor finds it's not absolutely necessary to keep all of his or her polling places open a full 12 hours a day, which isn't unusual for rural areas, he or she has the flexibility to save taxpayer money by not employing poll workers that aren't needed.

Critics of the new election law suggest there will be less time to vote. That is just not the case. Now, more than ever, voters have more options to choose from in order to take advantage of early voting.

Another important change to election law will affect voters who need to change their address from one county to another on the day of an election. Voters facing that specific circumstance will be required to cast a provisional ballot at their new polling place. Voters who change their address within their county are not affected.

While this new requirement will increase the number of provisional ballots cast, the increased oversight by county canvassing boards will also provide an extra level of security against fraud. And when combating fraud, proactive measures are better than reactive measures. As such, I've taken an additional proactive measure of my own. To further ensure that a legitimate provisional ballot won't go uncounted, I've directed county canvassing boards to approve every provisional ballot cast as a result of an address change, unless there is actual evidence of fraud.

Finally, some critics claim third-party voter organizations don't have enough time to register voters under this new law. Before the changes, third-party voter organizations had 10 days to submit new voter registrations. Now, organizations have 48 hours. While the time is significantly shorter, 48 hours is more than enough time to submit valid voter registrations.

I don't expect these changes will be the last for Florida's election law. If the system can be improved, it must be reformed accordingly. But today, the following remains true: Early voting remains at 96 hours, with greater flexibility for counties; if someone is eligible to vote, their vote will be counted, regardless of whether they changed their address at a polling place; and the new changes provide third-party voter organizations a reasonable time frame to submit voter registrations to their local supervisor of elections.

The right to vote is one of the pillars of our country, and I am committed to assuring the continued integrity of our elections. However you choose to vote, I will make sure you are able to do it in a timely and accessible manner.

Kurt Browning is Florida's secretary of state."

To characterize the efforts of American businesses and Governors throughout the nation who are working hard to build jobs in this way is not only wrong but stands in the way of their efforts to sell the value of our great nation every day. I recently returned from Brazil, where I and dozens of Florida business leaders worked hard to attract jobs to America. Every day my focus is on attracting new businesses and jobs to Florida. Obstacles to job creation in America are a result of policy, not of motivation. Our business taxes are among the highest in the world. Our regulations are among the most difficult in the world. If you need evidence, look no further than the companies who have moved their oil rigs from the Gulf coast to foreign countries in the last year because of the regulatory environment. Just last week, yet another major medical device manufacturer announced they were cutting more than 1,000 jobs because of new Obamacare taxes. The Presidents comments indicate a belief that more taxes, more regulation and more government is the solution, yet those are the very things standing in the way of those of us who are trying  very energetically  to recruit businesses and jobs to our states. Please, Mr. President, help us bring jobs to America and let us have an honest conversation about the barriers in our way. # # #"

With their new found leader, Barack Obama, the Socialist Party of America felt secure enough to announce the names of 70 democrats in Congress that belong to their caucus.

Other than Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who openly ran as a socialist, the rest of this lot ran as “moderate democrats.” I think it’s time we put the myth of the “moderate” democrat to bed.

As Mr. Turner declared that the election had been a referendum on the president, his buoyant supporters, gathered at a restaurant in Howard Beach, Queens, shouted Yes, we can, appropriating the galvanizing phrase of Mr. Obamas 2008 campaign. Mr. Turner predicted that voters elsewhere would also rebuke Mr. Obama in the elections next year. We have lit one candle today, he said. Its going to be a bonfire pretty soon. Mr. Weprin left his election night party at a pub in Forest Hills, Queens, around midnight, telling his supporters that he still hoped that he would overtake Mr. Turner as more returns came in. But in a statement e-mailed to reporters shortly after 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Mr. Weprin said he had called Mr. Turner and had conceded the race. Photo Im incredibly proud of the campaign that we ran, and incredibly grateful to the countless volunteers who worked day after day to bring our message to voters, Mr. Weprin said. In doing so we raised the profile of issues like Medicare , Social Security , and tax relief for working families  issues that will be of critical importance for the next Congress. Mr. Turners victory stirred anxiety among Democrats already worried about elections next year for president, the House and the Senate. The Turner campaign had eagerly courted disenchanted Democrats, and outside polling places around the district on Tuesday, multiple longtime Democrats confessed that despite concern about Mr. Turners eagerness to slash federal spending, they chose him hoping that his election would get lawmakers attention. I am a registered Democrat, I have always been a registered Democrat, I come from a family of Democrats  and I hate to say this, I voted Republican, said Linda Goldberg, 61, after casting her ballot in Queens. I need to send a message to the president that hes not doing a very good job. Our economy is horrible. People are scared. Mr. Turner will become the first Republican since 1920 elected to represent the Ninth Congressional District, which now stretches from the Rockaways to Forest Hills and encompasses a swath of middle-class and working-class neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens.

Mr. Turner capitalized on discontent in some corners of the Jewish community with Mr. Obamas posture toward Israel and his handling of the Middle East peace process. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch , a Democrat, urged voters to rebuke the president by voting for Mr. Turner. The emergence of Israel as an issue was a surprise, because Mr. Weprin is an observant Jew and strong supporter of Israel. But Mr. Weprins support in the Orthodox community had already been weakened by his vote to legalize same-sex marriage , and several voters interviewed on Tuesday said the Israel issue was a major factor in their decision to support Mr. Turner, who is Roman Catholic. Mr. Turner repeatedly criticized Mr. Obama on Israel. Mr. Weprin fought back by seeking to appeal to the districts many older voters, telling them that Mr. Turner was in sync with the Tea Party and would seek to weaken Social Security and Medicare. Photo Erik Huneke, 35, a history Ph.D. candidate who voted for Mr. Weprin, said that setting aside discussion of national symbolism, there was no question that Mr. Weprins platform better suited the political leanings of most voters in the district. Its understandable for people to be upset, Mr. Huneke said. But it would be nice if people had a longer-term perspective in terms of why theyre hurting now. Its not just Obamas fault. Mr. Weprins campaign made a central issue out of the future of federal entitlement programs, persuading voters like John Doherty, 64, a Democrat from Middle Village, Queens, to worry about whether Mr. Turner would favor deep cuts. But Mr. Doherty, a retired social worker, said his concern about entitlement programs had been overshadowed by the opportunity he saw to express his unhappiness about the economy in the special election.

The campaign was short  Mr. Weprin and Mr. Turner were chosen as nominees by their respective parties in early July  and attracted little attention or money for many weeks. As it became clear, however, that Mr. Turner might win, Mr. Weprin received a cash infusion from national Democrats, who spent more than $600,000 on television advertisements criticizing Mr. Turner. Mr. Weprin had also raised significantly more money than Mr. Turner and had the assistance of labor unions and strong local party organizations. Both campaigns enlisted senior party figures to bolster their candidates. Mr. Turner trumpeted endorsements not only from Mr. Koch, but also from former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and former Gov. George E. Pataki . Both made appearances with Mr. Turner and urged New Yorkers to vote for him as a way to admonish the president, for whom they did not have kind words. On the Democratic side, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and former President Bill Clinton recorded automated phone calls to voters for Mr. Weprin, and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who formerly represented the Ninth District, campaigned with him, as did the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn . The upset in New York came the same day that, in a special election in Nevada s Second District, an open seat was won by Mark Amodei, a Republican, over Kate Marshall, a Democrat. While Mr. Amodeis victory was hardly a surprise, as the district has been held by a Republican since it was created in the 1980s, his defeat in the more Democratic leaning parts of the district demonstrated the challenge Democrats face in a country frustrated with high levels of joblessness and no near end in sight to economic woes. The New York loss is an embarrassment to Representative Steve Israel, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Mr. Israel just a few months ago had expressed hope that the Democrats could move to take back control of the House; now his party appears to be facing a challenge defending seats it already holds."
http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/apr/26/tom-rooney/tom-rooney-farming-kids-screwdrivers-hoses/,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney (FL-16), Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry, today cosponsored the bipartisan “Preserving America’s Family Farm Act,” HR 4157, which would prevent the Department of Labor (DOL) from enacting controversial new restrictions on youth working on family farms.

“The family farm is a cornerstone of our nation’s economy and food supply, and it is a way of life for farmers across Florida and the country,” Rooney said. “The unreasonable, overreaching mandates proposed by the Department of Labor would severely restrict the ability of young people to work on family farms, and it would threaten generations of farm tradition and culture.

“Our bill would uphold the family farm so that young people can continue to learn important work ethics and skills while helping their families prosper.”

HR 4157 would prevent the Obama Administration from implementing its proposed rules to restrict family farm operations. The new mandates would prohibit youth under the age of 18 from being near certain animals without adult supervision, participating in common livestock practices like vaccinating, handling most animals more than six months old, operating farm machinery over 20 PTO horsepower, completing tasks at elevations over six feet high, and working at stockyards and grain and feed facilities. The language of the proposed rule is so specific it would even ban youth from operating a battery powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose. These restrictions would also severely limit participation in 4-H and FFA activities as well as farm safety classes.

http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jul/16/marco-rubio/rubio-says-taxes-health-care-law-do-not-discrimina/,"When Mitt Romney visited Florida on my behalf in the fall of 2010, we stood in Pumo's kitchen at Benedetto's Ristorante Italiano and listened to him explain how policies like Obamacare would impact his business and employees he had come to see as family. Since the Obamacare debate began in 2009, I have met thousands of real people impacted by this policy. One in particular has always stood out to me: restaurant owner Ben Pumo from Land O' Lakes. Gov. Romney and I heard a widely held concern around the country: Obamacare would impose new costs on his business, it would be a blow to his freedom to hire workers as he pleased without triggering new taxes, and he feared the worst was yet to come as Obamacare had empowered Washington bureaucrats to write new and unpredictable regulations. With the recent decision on Obamacare, we were reminded of why this news matters far beyond the Supreme Court's steps. It matters in kitchens like the one in Ben Pumo's restaurant and for individuals and business owners across the country. Obamacare is not the president's signature achievement. It's the signature example of the leadership failures and broken promises that have defined Obama's presidency. When the president assumed office, he faced the worst economy in generations. After throwing an $800 billion stimulus at the problem, he proposed a health-care overhaul with a mandate to force people to buy health insurance. Or else. He assured the American people that the individual mandate wasn't a tax. But when Obamacare was challenged in court for violating the Constitution, he changed his tune, arguing that it was permissible under Congress' taxing power. The court agreed and upheld Obamacare. The bait and switch proved to be a brilliant legal strategy, but a disastrous economic policy. For millions of Americans, including job creators, Obama's political win is now an IRS problem for them in the real world. Obamacare is bad policy that adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people. It does not discriminate between rich and poor. It hurts everyone. It is a job-killer that will drive up insurance premiums and jeopardize the ability of millions of Americans to keep the insurance coverage of their choice. For individuals not complying with Obamacare, it means the IRS will come calling if they fail to pay the Obamacare tax. For job creators  and unemployed workers relying on them to work again  Obamacare is a new regulatory maze to figure out. For instance, once a business reaches 50 full-time employees, the Obamacare tax will kick in to the tune of $2,000 for each full-time employee in excess of 30 full-time employees unless the business meets a mandate to provide health coverage for them. There are no penalties if part-time employees are not offered coverage. Thus, rather than freely being able to hire employees without fear of an IRS problem, employers will be encouraged to circumvent the Obamacare tax by hiring people on a part-time basis so they don't count for this tax. Or maybe an entrepreneur has 49 employees and could use several more to help meet increased demand. Obamacare creates a perverse incentive to hold back and just make existing employees work more so the 50-employee threshold tax isn't triggered."

Congresswoman Wilson released the following statement:

 “Today’s announcement by the FAA is a step in the right direction.  I will continue to make this airport my top priority, and I am confident that we will win long-term funding.

http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/feb/18/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-said-weve-always-needed-foreign-worker/,"I appreciate the opportunity to respond to Erick’s post last night regarding the principles for immigration reform I have recently developed. Before diving into the details of the plan, I want to take a moment to point out how the debate about immigration reflects positively on the conservative movement in general. Unlike the left, whose default tactic is to attack and destroy the personal character of those who disagree with their views, the conservative movement is capable of accommodating a vibrant internal debate on important issues solely on the merits. RedState has always been a welcoming forum for that sort of debate.

First, let me identify the problem we face. We have a legal immigration system that doesn’t work, we don’t have an effective system to enforce our immigration laws, and we have by some estimates as many as 11 million human beings living in the United States without the proper immigration documents in a state of de facto amnesty. It’s a problem that has both political and economic ramifications on our nation.

On the political front, a growing number of voters of Asian and Hispanic descent have been convinced by the left that conservative opposition to immigration reform equates to being anti-immigrant. This is unfair, and it is untrue. But they have pulled it off and, as a result, our ability to convince these fast-growing communities that the principles of limited government and free enterprise are better for them than big government and collectivism has been impaired.

The economic ramifications, however, are even more serious. For example, our technology sector creates roughly 120,000 computer engineering jobs a year, but our universities only graduate about 40,000 students a year in that field. The long term answer, of course, is to get more American students to graduate in this field. But the immediate problem is that, in the absence of an immigration system where these workers can be brought here, these jobs are sent overseas to them.

Another example is in agriculture, where a stable and affordable domestic supply of food is critical to our national security and our quality of life. Agriculture has always required a significant work force from abroad, but we do not have a system through which growers and dairies can bring a workforce legally into the U.S.

This broken system of immigration, combined with lax enforcement, has resulted in our illegal immigration problem.

In an ideal world, we could go back to 1986 and rewrite the immigration reform efforts implemented then to account for these issues and to ensure that real enforcement measures would be implemented. But in the real world, we cannot do that. We have to deal with what we have in the best way possible and make sure that this never ever happens again.

The principles I have proposed to deal with this issue are not perfect, but I believe they create a framework for dealing with this reality in a responsible and reasonable way. And I think conservatives have already won important concessions from Democrats that we can build on to shape the actual legislation.

First, we would modernize our legal immigration system. In essence, we create one that meets the needs this country has in this new century. For example, while I support our family-based system of immigration, we can no longer afford to have less than ten percent of our immigration based on skill and talent. We need a functional guest worker program so that, in times of low unemployment and rapid economic growth, our industries have the labor they need to continue growing. And we need an agricultural worker program that allows our growers to contract the seasonal and year round labor they need legally.

Second, we need real enforcement mechanisms. An employment verification system is the key to this. We have the technology to implement such a system, so we just need to do it. Over 40 percent of our illegal immigrants entered legally and overstayed their visas. That’s why we need to have a complete system of tracking the entry and exit of visitors, using the technologies available to us today. And we need to achieve control of our borders. This is not just an immigration issue; this is a national security and sovereignty issue. And it can be done. The southern border is actually divided into nine separate sectors. There has been progress made in some sectors and not enough on others. We need to establish the high probability of intercepting illegal crossings in each of these sectors in a timely and effective manner.

And third, we have to deal with those who are here now without documents. I am not happy about the fact that we face this problem. But we do. Most of these are people who will be here for the rest of their lives with or without documents, so it is in our best interest to deal with them and to make sure this never happens again.

This is how I have proposed we do so. First, those who have violated our immigration laws must come forward and undergo a background check. If they have committed a serious crime, they will be deported. If they have not, they will have two choices. They can avail themselves of the current law which requires them to return to their native country, wait ten years and then apply for a green card. Or if they decide to remain in the United States, they will do so under the equivalent of a non-immigrant work permit by paying a substantial fine and back taxes. If they choose the non-immigrant work visa, they will not qualify for any federal benefits, including ObamaCare.

Those who choose the non-immigrant work permit will not be allowed to apply for a green card for a substantial period of time. And they will not be allowed to apply until the enforcement mechanisms outlined above are in place. Thereafter, once these conditions are met, and if they have not violated any laws while holding the work permit, the only thing they will be allowed to do is apply for a green card using the same process everyone else uses. That is, they apply, they wait in line behind everyone who has applied before them and when their turn comes up, they have to qualify for one of the existing green card programs.

In his post, Erick raised several points. First, he expresses doubt that the border can ever be secured because no one will ever agree that it is secured. There are ways to measure the security at the border. There are real and identifiable standards that can be used. And there are ways to certify this, free of political interference. If the bill that is ultimately crafted achieves this, I will support it. If it does not, I won’t.

Second, he objects to the notion of “jobs that Americans won’t do”. He correctly points out that the more accurate description is “jobs that Americans won’t do at that price point”. The fact is that, as Americans, we have reached a certain standard of living that requires us to make a certain amount of money before we will do certain jobs. The problem is that, in a free market, the cost of production is always passed on to the consumer. That is one of the reasons why I object to tax increases – because the cost is always paid by workers and customers. The same is true for labor costs. There is a price point at which our farmers simply won’t do business because they will not be able to offer products at an affordable price.

Erick’s final objection is that the plan does nothing to address the real problems with immigration – in other words, the black market for low skilled labor, long delays in the system and so forth. This is not accurate. Our principles call for the creation of a guest worker program that, when effectively implemented in conjunction with a workplace verification system, would wipe out the black market for low skilled labor. And as the principles call for, any modernization effort would have to address the long delays in the system, which a modernized agricultural worker program and STEM visa reform would do.

Perhaps the most widely used criticism I have seen is that this nothing but an updated version of earlier efforts. There are significant differences. The previous efforts did not have effective border security, workplace enforcement and entry-exit enforcement triggers, whereas this plan must or I will not support it.

The previous plan created a special pathway to citizenship through a Z-Visa, whereas these principles do not. And if the bill does, I will not support it.

Finally, Erick expresses concerns that we should not pander in the name of a solution. On this point, Erick and I are in total agreement. I’m not pursuing reforms to our immigration system because of the last election or future elections. I’m doing what I can because I believe it’s important for our country, because conservative principles can make this legislation better, and immigration is one of the few issues where government has a legitimate and central role to play.

As I have clearly stated, I will not engage in a bidding war with the President to see who can come up with the fastest and cheapest path to citizenship. That is why having these principles in writing was so important. We now have a bipartisan collection of senators – including some prominent allies of the President – committed, in writing, to border security and other enforcement triggers, a functional guest worker program and the idea that those who violated our immigration laws and stay on a work permit will not be able to receive federal benefits. We even got President Obama to concede that undocumented immigrants who avail themselves of this program will not be eligible for federal benefits, including Obamacare, during their lengthy non-immigrant status. If the President decides to support a plan to the left of this, he will do so in conflict with leaders of his own party – not to mention the majority of Americans – and ultimately bear the responsibility for derailing a bi-partisan immigration plan.

I do not pretend that this is a perfect solution. I know that the idea of accommodating people who violated our immigration laws, in any way, makes many people uncomfortable. But I have concluded that it is not good for our country to continue to allow this problem to linger. We are better off solving this once and for all.

Now begins the process of turning these principles into a bill. The details will matter a lot. This is another place where conservatives and readers of RedState can help influence the final outcome. When I was elected, insisting on transparency and openness in Congress was a central topic of discussion. It’s something I will insist on throughout this process. I welcome input, criticism and suggestions. A bill this important cannot be written behind closed doors and then forced on the American people. Whatever our work group comes up with is a starting point, not a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.

And I understand there are those who will not support any effort. Some raise valid points and I respect their views. But in the end, to leave things the way they are now is de facto amnesty and a barrier to accomplishing important government reforms in other areas. It is no way to run a nation of immigrants."
http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/feb/18/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-us-farmers-have-no-way-bring-work/,"I appreciate the opportunity to respond to Erick’s post last night regarding the principles for immigration reform I have recently developed. Before diving into the details of the plan, I want to take a moment to point out how the debate about immigration reflects positively on the conservative movement in general. Unlike the left, whose default tactic is to attack and destroy the personal character of those who disagree with their views, the conservative movement is capable of accommodating a vibrant internal debate on important issues solely on the merits. RedState has always been a welcoming forum for that sort of debate.

First, let me identify the problem we face. We have a legal immigration system that doesn’t work, we don’t have an effective system to enforce our immigration laws, and we have by some estimates as many as 11 million human beings living in the United States without the proper immigration documents in a state of de facto amnesty. It’s a problem that has both political and economic ramifications on our nation.

On the political front, a growing number of voters of Asian and Hispanic descent have been convinced by the left that conservative opposition to immigration reform equates to being anti-immigrant. This is unfair, and it is untrue. But they have pulled it off and, as a result, our ability to convince these fast-growing communities that the principles of limited government and free enterprise are better for them than big government and collectivism has been impaired.

The economic ramifications, however, are even more serious. For example, our technology sector creates roughly 120,000 computer engineering jobs a year, but our universities only graduate about 40,000 students a year in that field. The long term answer, of course, is to get more American students to graduate in this field. But the immediate problem is that, in the absence of an immigration system where these workers can be brought here, these jobs are sent overseas to them.

Another example is in agriculture, where a stable and affordable domestic supply of food is critical to our national security and our quality of life. Agriculture has always required a significant work force from abroad, but we do not have a system through which growers and dairies can bring a workforce legally into the U.S.

This broken system of immigration, combined with lax enforcement, has resulted in our illegal immigration problem.

In an ideal world, we could go back to 1986 and rewrite the immigration reform efforts implemented then to account for these issues and to ensure that real enforcement measures would be implemented. But in the real world, we cannot do that. We have to deal with what we have in the best way possible and make sure that this never ever happens again.

The principles I have proposed to deal with this issue are not perfect, but I believe they create a framework for dealing with this reality in a responsible and reasonable way. And I think conservatives have already won important concessions from Democrats that we can build on to shape the actual legislation.

First, we would modernize our legal immigration system. In essence, we create one that meets the needs this country has in this new century. For example, while I support our family-based system of immigration, we can no longer afford to have less than ten percent of our immigration based on skill and talent. We need a functional guest worker program so that, in times of low unemployment and rapid economic growth, our industries have the labor they need to continue growing. And we need an agricultural worker program that allows our growers to contract the seasonal and year round labor they need legally.

Second, we need real enforcement mechanisms. An employment verification system is the key to this. We have the technology to implement such a system, so we just need to do it. Over 40 percent of our illegal immigrants entered legally and overstayed their visas. That’s why we need to have a complete system of tracking the entry and exit of visitors, using the technologies available to us today. And we need to achieve control of our borders. This is not just an immigration issue; this is a national security and sovereignty issue. And it can be done. The southern border is actually divided into nine separate sectors. There has been progress made in some sectors and not enough on others. We need to establish the high probability of intercepting illegal crossings in each of these sectors in a timely and effective manner.

And third, we have to deal with those who are here now without documents. I am not happy about the fact that we face this problem. But we do. Most of these are people who will be here for the rest of their lives with or without documents, so it is in our best interest to deal with them and to make sure this never happens again.

This is how I have proposed we do so. First, those who have violated our immigration laws must come forward and undergo a background check. If they have committed a serious crime, they will be deported. If they have not, they will have two choices. They can avail themselves of the current law which requires them to return to their native country, wait ten years and then apply for a green card. Or if they decide to remain in the United States, they will do so under the equivalent of a non-immigrant work permit by paying a substantial fine and back taxes. If they choose the non-immigrant work visa, they will not qualify for any federal benefits, including ObamaCare.

Those who choose the non-immigrant work permit will not be allowed to apply for a green card for a substantial period of time. And they will not be allowed to apply until the enforcement mechanisms outlined above are in place. Thereafter, once these conditions are met, and if they have not violated any laws while holding the work permit, the only thing they will be allowed to do is apply for a green card using the same process everyone else uses. That is, they apply, they wait in line behind everyone who has applied before them and when their turn comes up, they have to qualify for one of the existing green card programs.

In his post, Erick raised several points. First, he expresses doubt that the border can ever be secured because no one will ever agree that it is secured. There are ways to measure the security at the border. There are real and identifiable standards that can be used. And there are ways to certify this, free of political interference. If the bill that is ultimately crafted achieves this, I will support it. If it does not, I won’t.

Second, he objects to the notion of “jobs that Americans won’t do”. He correctly points out that the more accurate description is “jobs that Americans won’t do at that price point”. The fact is that, as Americans, we have reached a certain standard of living that requires us to make a certain amount of money before we will do certain jobs. The problem is that, in a free market, the cost of production is always passed on to the consumer. That is one of the reasons why I object to tax increases – because the cost is always paid by workers and customers. The same is true for labor costs. There is a price point at which our farmers simply won’t do business because they will not be able to offer products at an affordable price.

Erick’s final objection is that the plan does nothing to address the real problems with immigration – in other words, the black market for low skilled labor, long delays in the system and so forth. This is not accurate. Our principles call for the creation of a guest worker program that, when effectively implemented in conjunction with a workplace verification system, would wipe out the black market for low skilled labor. And as the principles call for, any modernization effort would have to address the long delays in the system, which a modernized agricultural worker program and STEM visa reform would do.

Perhaps the most widely used criticism I have seen is that this nothing but an updated version of earlier efforts. There are significant differences. The previous efforts did not have effective border security, workplace enforcement and entry-exit enforcement triggers, whereas this plan must or I will not support it.

The previous plan created a special pathway to citizenship through a Z-Visa, whereas these principles do not. And if the bill does, I will not support it.

Finally, Erick expresses concerns that we should not pander in the name of a solution. On this point, Erick and I are in total agreement. I’m not pursuing reforms to our immigration system because of the last election or future elections. I’m doing what I can because I believe it’s important for our country, because conservative principles can make this legislation better, and immigration is one of the few issues where government has a legitimate and central role to play.

As I have clearly stated, I will not engage in a bidding war with the President to see who can come up with the fastest and cheapest path to citizenship. That is why having these principles in writing was so important. We now have a bipartisan collection of senators – including some prominent allies of the President – committed, in writing, to border security and other enforcement triggers, a functional guest worker program and the idea that those who violated our immigration laws and stay on a work permit will not be able to receive federal benefits. We even got President Obama to concede that undocumented immigrants who avail themselves of this program will not be eligible for federal benefits, including Obamacare, during their lengthy non-immigrant status. If the President decides to support a plan to the left of this, he will do so in conflict with leaders of his own party – not to mention the majority of Americans – and ultimately bear the responsibility for derailing a bi-partisan immigration plan.

I do not pretend that this is a perfect solution. I know that the idea of accommodating people who violated our immigration laws, in any way, makes many people uncomfortable. But I have concluded that it is not good for our country to continue to allow this problem to linger. We are better off solving this once and for all.

Now begins the process of turning these principles into a bill. The details will matter a lot. This is another place where conservatives and readers of RedState can help influence the final outcome. When I was elected, insisting on transparency and openness in Congress was a central topic of discussion. It’s something I will insist on throughout this process. I welcome input, criticism and suggestions. A bill this important cannot be written behind closed doors and then forced on the American people. Whatever our work group comes up with is a starting point, not a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.

And I understand there are those who will not support any effort. Some raise valid points and I respect their views. But in the end, to leave things the way they are now is de facto amnesty and a barrier to accomplishing important government reforms in other areas. It is no way to run a nation of immigrants."
http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/jun/26/blog-posting/does-immigration-bill-include-free-obamacars-teens/,"Breitbart News has learned there is a provision included in the immigration bill that could be used to give free cars, motorcycles, scooters or other vehicles to young people around the country over a period of 15 months after the bill passes. The new provision is a result of the latest addition to the Corker-Hoeven amendment, which is essentially an entirely new version of the bill. The Washington Examiners Byron York uncovered the new Obama stimulus program that Gang of Eight members and other Senate Republicans inserted into the bill as a sweetheart deal for liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). The left leaning Senator was previously critical of the legislation. The original Gang bill ended with a section designated Title IV, which was headlined REFORMS TO NON-IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAMS, York wrote on Sunday. The Hoeven-Corker version of the bill added a Title V, with the headline JOBS FOR YOUTH. The measure would provide $1.5 billion in the next two years to provide jobs for Americans between the ages of 16 and 24. It was originally pushed by Democratic Sen. Bernard Sanders, who wanted to come to the aid of young workers who were hard hit by the Wall Street-caused recession. Now, Sanders says immigration reform will further damage youth job prospects. A provision under that new stimulus program title allows for the use of spending the taxpayer money on the program to provide transportation for youth to and from their jobs. (f) USE OF FUNDS. (1) IN GENERAL.The funds made available under this section shall be used (A) to provide summer employment opportunities for low-income youth, with direct linkages to academic and occupational learning, and may be used to provide supportive services, such as transportation or child care, that is necessary to enable the participation of such youth in the opportunities; The total appropriation for this new stimulus program would be $1.5 billion that would be divvied up among states that applied for the money. According to the proposed statute as written, all the money would need to be spent in a year-and-three-months period. The amounts appropriated under this title shall be available for obligation by the Secretary of Labor until December 31, 2014, and shall be available for expenditure by grantees (including subgrantees) until September 30, 2015, the part of the provision detailing how long the money would be available for reads. A GOP senate aide told Breitbart News that for the country to be able to spend $1.5 billion on such a program so fast, it would need to buy, lease or rent motor vehicles for beneficiaries of the new government handout. The provision that outlines how the money can be legally used for providing supportive services like transportation, the aide said, could easily be interpreted to mean the money could be spent buying or leasing or renting vehicles for the beneficiaries. This appears to give states authority to buy, lease or rent motorcycles, cars and scooters or anything kids want to buy to get to and from a job, the GOP aide said."

http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/nov/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-declares-florida-top-travel-destination/,"Florida has already welcomed more than 72 million visitors in 2013

Governor Rick Scott today announced that according to preliminary estimates* released by VISIT FLORIDA – the state’s official tourism marketing corporation – 22.9 million visitors came to Florida in the third quarter of 2013 (July-September), an increase of 1.7 percent over the same period in 2012.  These numbers represent the largest third quarter for visitation in the state’s history.

Governor Scott said, “Today’s announcement of another record quarter for visitation clearly shows ‘It’s Working’ in Florida.  Because every 85 visitors to our state supports one Florida job; a growing tourism industry equates to more jobs for Florida families and a stronger economy.  As we move toward our third consecutive year of record tourism growth, it is clear why the Sunshine State remains the top travel destination across the world. ”

Through the first three quarters of 2013, Florida welcomed 72.6 million visitors – an increase of 3.4 percent over the same period last year.  Visitor spending in Florida for January-August 2013 (last reported month) was $51.8 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 5.8 percent from the same period in 2012.  Direct travel-related employment in Florida for January-August (last reported month) rose 2.8 percent, adding 29,700 jobs since this same time one year ago.  Each of these figures marks a record, making the first three quarters of 2013 the largest nine-month period in the history of Florida’s tourism industry.

“So far this year, we’re up nearly 2.5 million visitors who increased their spending by almost $3 billion, led by a double-digit increase in international visitors,” said Tammy Gustafson, Chair of the VISIT FLORIDA Board of Directors. “This continued momentum is a testament to the strength of VISIT FLORIDA’s marketing efforts, the power of the Sunshine State brand and the dedication of the nearly 1.1 million Floridians who work in the state’s tourism industry.”

An estimated 19.5 million domestic visitors came to Florida during the third quarter of 2013, representing a 0.5 percent increase from the same period in 2012. Florida welcomed 2.9 million overseas visitors in Q3 2013, representing a 10.1 percent increase over Q3 2012, and 516,000 Canadian visitors during the same period, representing a 2.9 percent increase from the previous year.

“Record visitor numbers equate to record visitor spending,” said Will Seccombe, President and CEO of VISIT FLORIDA. “With taxable sales up, occupancy rates up, rental car collections up, bed taxes up and average daily room rates up, Florida’s tourism industry has never been stronger.”

Carol Dover, President and CEO of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association said, “These newly released tourism numbers are encouraging to our more than 10,000 members of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association in our effort to attract over 100 million visitors to the Sunshine State. As Florida’s largest employer, our tourism and hospitality industry is on the front lines each and every day in providing a world class experience to visitors coming to our state for business meetings, conventions, vacations and milestone celebrations. We thank Florida Governor Rick Scott and members of the Florida Legislature for providing a pro-business and pro-family environment which not only attracts national and international tourists, but supports job creation and growth here at home.”

Additional Preliminary Data:

The  Average Daily Room Rate rose 3.6  percent to $102.69 and the occupancy rate for Florida  hotels increased 1.9 percentage points to 62.7 percent in Q3 2013 compared to Q3 2012.
Tourism-related employment has lead the state in growth for 41 straight months
Nearly 13.6 million Florida residents are estimated to have taken a pleasure trip during Q3 2013.
The share of in-state pleasure trips by residents was 42.3 percent, resulting  in more than 5.7 million pleasure trips in-state – a 6.2 percent increase from the same time last year.
Traffic  at the state’s five Official Florida Welcome Centers managed by VISIT FLORIDA was up 4.0% in Q3 2013.

http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/jun/06/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/ileana-ros-lehtinen-voted-against-va-backlog-fixes/,"As House Republicans shamelessly try to score political points over the crisis in veterans care, Congresswoman  Ileana Ros-Lehtinen’s votes tell the true story of her record: when she had a chance to fix this problem, she voted against the fixes.
 
“It’s a shame that when Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen had a chance to do something to help shorten the wait time at the VA she voted no,” said Josh Schwerin of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  “Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen voted against a commonsense solution to this problem and our heroes deserve better.”
 
BACKGROUND:
 
Voted to Block the Veterans Backlog Reduction Act. In 2013, Ros-Lehtinen voted against considering the Veterans Backlog Reduction Act, which would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to pay provisional benefits for certain non-adjudicated claims.  The previous question was approved 224-195. A vote against the motion would have allowed for consideration of the veterans bill. [H Res 232, Vote #180, 5/23/13; Congressional Record, H2925, 5/23/13]
 
Voted Against Increasing Funds to Reduce the Backlog in Veterans Disability Claims.  In 2013, Ros-Lehtinen voted against a motion that would help reduce the backlog of disability claims for veterans. The motion would have added $9.2 million in funding to hire an additional 94 claims processors to help reduce the veterans disability claims backlog. [CQ Floor Votes, 6/04/13; HR 2216, Vote #192, 6/04/13]
 
Voted For Extreme Plan That Would “Likely Result” In a Government Shutdown. In 2013, Ros-Lehtinen voted for an extreme House Republican continuing resolution that the Associated Press reported would “likely result” in the shutdown of the federal government. The bill passed 230-189. [HJ Res 59, Vote #478, 9/20/13; Associated Press,8/23/13]
 
Shutdown Delayed Training for Service Members Transitioning to Civilian Life.  In November 2013, the OMB reported that the shutdown “delayed workshops for 1,400 military service members to help them transition to civilian life and employment.” [OMB, November 2013]
 
Shutdown Delayed Military Death Benefits.  “But until the lapse in federal funding ends, the families of deceased military personnel cannot expect to receive the “death gratuity” of $100,000 the Defense Department deposits in their bank account within 24 to 36 hours, defense officials said […]Grieving families also cannot expect the military to cover the usual costs of travel to meet their loved ones returning home in American flag-draped coffins through Dover Air Force Base, or pay for funerals and burials, according to the Defense Department.” [Washington Post, 10/09/13]
 
Shutdown Forced VA to Close Regional Offices, Suspend Services and Programs. “All public access to the VA’s 56 regional offices was suspended Tuesday because of a lack of funds, the VA said […]The VA is also suspending services such as educational and vocational counseling and outreach programs, including those conducted at military facilities.” [Washington Post, 10/09/13]
 
Voted Against Protecting Veterans Benefits During a Government Shutdown. In September 2013, Ros-Lehtinen voted against ensuring veterans benefits would not be delayed during a government shutdown. She later voted against guaranteeing the processing of veterans benefits during a government shutdown. [HJ Res 59, Vote #477, 9/20/13; HR 3102, Vote #475, 9/19/13; CQ Floor Votes, 9/20/13, 9/19/13]
 
Voted to Make it More Difficult for Veterans to Get Benefits.  In 2011, Ros-Lehtinen voted for an amendment that would make it harder for low-income veterans and Social Security recipients to retain counsel in a civil action against the United States, like when fighting for benefits. The Lummis amendment imposed a seven-month moratorium on all legal fees paid under the Equal Access to Justice Act, a Reagan-era law designed to help people afford an attorney while suing the government.  “We’re in the middle of two wars right now and to make it harder for a veteran — fighting for his benefits — to have an attorney is a horrible thing. That’s not what this country is about,” Robert Chishold, a prominent veterans’ law attorney said. [Politico, 2/23/11; HR 1, Vote #85, 2/17/11]
 
Voted Against Protecting Mortgage Relief for Veterans and Active Duty Service Members. In 2011, Ros-Lehtinen voted against a motion that would protect mortgage assistance under the Emergency Mortgage Relief Program for active duty service members and their families, veterans, and Gold Star eligible families. The underling bill would terminate the Home Affordable Modification Program. [CQ Floor Votes, 3/11/11; HR 839, Vote #197, 3/29/11]
 
Voted Against Increasing Housing Assistance for Veterans. In June 2012, Ros-Lehtinen voted against increasing funding for veterans rental voucher’s by $75 million.  [CQ Floor Votes, 6/29/12; HR 5972, Vote #449, 6/29/12]
 
Voted to Slash Homeless Veterans’ Assistance. In 2011, Ros-Lehtinen voted for a spending bill that would have eliminated $75 million slated to house homeless Veterans. According to CNN, the cuts would have hurt some 11,000 homeless veterans who qualified for housing in 2011 but had not received vouchers. [HR 1, Vote # 147, 2/19/11; National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, 4/12/11; CNN, 3/1/11]
 
Voted Against Increasing Funds for Veterans Medical and Prosthetic Research.  In March 2012, Ros-Lehtinen voted against a motion that would increase funding for veterans medical and prosthetic research by $28.3 million. [CQ Floor Votes, 5/31/12; HR 5854, Vote #304, 5/31/12]
 
Voted Against Increasing Funds for Veterans Medical Services for Mental Health.  In June 2011, Ros-Lehtinen voted against a motion that would increase funding for veterans medical services for post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide prevention by $20 million.

Anyone who isn’t certain that Democrats are devoted to destroying America need only take a look at their despicable conduct in the Florida Senate. In a vote that never should have had to be taken, every single Democrat voted to force Sharia Law on the people of Florida. By doing so, they placed women and children in very real danger. The vote was 24 votes for America and 14 votes for al Qaeda and the Taliban cast by loathsome Democrats. They voted to deny Americans the Constitutional protections generations of American men and women fought for and died to protect. Democrats have revealed their desire to force Americans to live as slaves to a third world, foreign “justice system.”

Since the liars in the Democrat–controlled media won’t describe what these quislings have tried to force on Americans, here is an outline of the horrors of Sharia Law.

There would be no freedom of religion because Sharia supports only Islam.

There would be no freedom of speech.

There would be no protection for homosexuals, Christians, or anyone else Islamists don’t like.

Rape victims would be executed, and those who were not executed by the state would legally be murdered by their families as “honor killings.”

Women would not be allowed to vote, drive, go to college, or show their faces in public. Little girls as young as 8 years old would be forced to “marry” men three and four times their age. Many would die when these beasts forced themselves on their “brides.”

Women would not be allowed to be treated by male doctors they were not related to.

Stoning as a form of execution would be sanctioned for women caught in adultery. Women would be forced to wear burkas in public.

There would be no pig farms or dogs, and public schools would be forbidden from serving anything but Halal–style food.

Alcoholic beverages would be forbidden, and cab drivers who suspect a passenger is carrying alcoholic beverages (or Christian or Hebrew bibles) could refuse them service.

Democrats voted to force this on American citizens. If they had the necessary numbers in the Florida legislature, Sharia Law in all its barbarity would be used in Florida courts. Democrats tried this. Keep this in mind next fall.

And when you vote for Amendment 2, not only are you voting for a medication that is proven to help people with cancer, HIV & AIDS, glaucoma, PTSD, MS and more, but youre also voting for positive change in the community. Now, the opponents of Amendment 2 have taken on a tone similar to Donald Trumpinstilling fear through saturating the media with misinformation. For example, the opponents to this amendment have touted that states like Colorado (who successfully passed a similar bill) have experienced a higher use of marijuana among 10th graders. But if you look at studies from noteworthy organizations such as the International Journal of Drug Policy, Colorado Department of Public Safety and Lancet Psychiatry to see the difference between adolescent use before and after passing a medical marijuana law, the level of misuse for that demographic went down. Therefore I would strongly encourage you not to get caught up by those types of scare tactics while considering the many benefits that passing this bill will bring to people you deeply care about. What is also important to know is that although some debilitated patients may require higher levels of THC than others based on their specific medical condition, medical-grade marijuana alone, will not get that patienthigh, no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant. And unlike the rumors floating around, medical-grade marijuana does not have to be smoked to be effective. It also comes in various other forms such as an ointment, oil, pill and skin patch. Im reminded of Bridgette Wilkie from Orlando. Bridgette is a mother, wife and entrepreneur. She suffers from sickle cell anemia and lives with chronic pain that most people cannot imagine. Bridgette is taking elephant doses of Oxycontin and Oxycodone and still, there are days when she cannot get out of bed to see her daughter off to school because the pain is just too unbearable.The narcotics that are prescribed for Bridgette have terrible side effects on her organs that make her overall condition worse. It would be great if she could have access to other effective and safer alternative treatments like medical-grade marijuana, without making her high. Doctors should not be restricted from utilizing other safer and well-proven treatment methods when patients like Bridgette have such painful reactions to the narcotics typically prescribed for people in her condition. As you may know, current state regulations in Florida do not necessarily prevent doctors from prescribing (or over-prescribing) other drugs such as Morphine, Xanax, Oxycontin and other potentially deadly medications that are much more likely to be habit-forming. By supporting Amendment 2, you will help to ensure the right level of oversight in how medical-grade marijuana will be prescribed and distributed. In fact, one of the key provisions of this amendment is that only licensed physicians can recommend medical-grade marijuana and will be held accountable if they are found to be negligent. Think about the people in your life, your church or community who will begin to finally find comfort and relief when Amendment 2 passes. Furthermore,history shows that when a state enacts a medical marijuana law, first-time (and ongoing) use among teens in that state goes down. So when we go to the ballot box, we need to vote YES to prevent Florida politics from over-reaching at the expense of people like Bridgette (or our veterans, cancer patients, those suffering from AIDS and others) who could benefit greatly from a safer, more effective and more controlled medical alternative.

http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/dec/05/rick-scott/rick-scott-misleads-about-inventors-obamacare-igno/,"I recently met with President-elect Donald Trump on how we can undo the terrible damage of Obamacare and reinvent great health care for Americas future. Other than President Obama and a few stragglers, everyone now realizes that Obamacare was a terrible notion. It was sold on a lie. It was invented by liberal academic theorists who have no interaction with real families and businesses and therefore it doesnt work. Costs are skyrocketing, and the news of 25% premium increases during the two weeks before the election put the final nail in Hillary Clintons electoral coffin. Obama thought the problem with American health care was access. He was wrong. The real problem with American health care has been cost, a problem which Obamacare made far worse. The only way to achieve good access to quality care is to reduce costs. There is no other way, unless we just want to enact socialist policies from Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. By electing Donald Trump, voters said no thanks to that approach. The Washington insiders like to say that Obamacare cannot be repealed, it can only be modified. Thats absurd, just like all the other stuff they tell you cant be done in Washington. We are Americans and we can do anything we set our minds to. Donald Trump is bringing that can-do attitude with him to Washington. We need a major do-over for this failed policy and we can do that by: Acknowledging that we have a problem: Before turning to the road ahead for reform we must acknowledge that Obamacare was supposed to lower the cost of health care in our country. That was part of the sales pitch we heard  and if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. The sales pitch was a lie. Many Americans lost the doctors they liked, and many even have fewer doctors to choose from. The increases in health care costs are now at a 32-year high and are expected to continue increasing in the coming months. Creating more competition: We have to open up the market and create more competition. Families should be able to purchase coverage that works best for them. This can start by allowing individuals to buy insurance across state lines. Not only will this increase competition and reduce costs, it will also encourage more individuals to participate and create a safety net for those who truly need it. We need to encourage more providers to enter the marketplace and empower individuals to buy health care by giving tax breaks or incentives to those who purchase it  we already do this for employers, why not individuals? Giving states control: If the federal government returned families tax dollars back to the states, each state could create a system that works for families there. A system where states take the lead in designing what works for their residents can happen if all states are treated the same regarding the money the federal government allocates; the citizens of each state can decide who to cover; and all money from the federal government would be spent transparently on health care. Governors know the dynamics of their states' health care landscape better than Washington. Removing mandates: We should not be telling people what insurance to buy. Our health care system will work best if there are no individual or company mandates. Just like with any product or service, people should buy the insurance they want  not what government thinks they need. POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Rewarding personal responsibility: People need to be rewarded for eating right, exercising and not smoking. When people have an incentive to make healthy decisions and focus on prevention, health care costs will be driven down and people will lead healthier lives. This can happen if insurance companies give people meaningful incentives for making healthy choices, like a reduction in premiums or reimbursing things like gym memberships. I know what it is like to live without health insurance. I remember the anguish my parents felt when they couldnt afford to help my brother when he had a serious hip disease. But, I also see what the lie of Obamacare has become in our country. People living under federal penalties for not buying insurance is crazy. Premiums that increase 25% a year on families are absurd. Washington has become accustomed to creating massive federal programs we cannot afford. But usually the bill isnt due for decades, so the incentive for real reform just limps along. This time, Obamacare crashed in only a few years. It is evident to everyone, even Bill Clinton, just how crazy this Washington lie was. The time for major change in health care is now. There is no doubt President-elect Donald Trump is the man for the job and I look forward to helping him and incoming Health and Human Services Secretary, Representative Tom Price, implement real reform every step of the way.

http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/may/11/carlos-beruff/deal-allows-iran-produce-nuclear-weapon-us-senate-/,"Today, Carlos Beruff released the following statement in response to today’s New York Times revelations that the Obama Administration misled the American people on the Iran deal:

“I’ve said all along that President Obama is a terrible negotiator who negotiated with Iran like he was playing poker with his cards face up. But today’s report shows that it was actually much worse. While telling the public that negotiations began after Iran elected a ‘moderate’ leader, today’s report shows that the negotiations started much sooner. It’s clear that President Obama went into negotiations with one goal: to get a deal that would solidify his foreign policy legacy with the liberal elites, even at the expense of the long-term safety of the American people.

“Both Congressman Grayson and Congressman Murphy supported President Obama’s disastrous deal, which allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon. Do they still support the deal now that it’s been revealed that the Administration misled the American people and Congress? The people of Florida deserve an answer.”"

Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. — In response to Marco Rubio’s transparent attempt to paper over his record of vehemently opposing all real forms of gun violence prevention, Patrick Murphy released the following statement:
“Floridians won’t be fooled by Marco Rubio’s transparent attempt to paper over his relentless opposition to legislation that prevents gun violence,” said Rep. Murphy. “After the tragedy in Orlando, Rubio used the deaths of 49 innocent Floridians to run for re-election while voting against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe. He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the No Fly List from purchasing guns.

“For Marco Rubio to introduce this bill now is an embarrassment. Floridians deserve better than Marco Rubio’s callous political opportunism as he continues to stand side by side with the gun lobby instead of keeping Floridians safe.”

Escambia Sheriff David Morgan believes that part of his job description includes teaching black people how to be good citizens. During a YouTube video, Morgan explained that the job of African-Americans in this country is to mimic white Americans whenever possible. As such, Morgan explained that since his family is Welsh but he doesnt refer to himself as a Welsh-American, neither should blacks call themselves African-Americans. We are all Americans, he says, and blacks should get in step with him. First off, let me take issue with the title of African-American, he began. Were Americans. Morgan, who deems himself an expert on minority issues, even though hes probably never read a book by a black scholar, or a book on poverty in America for that matter, says most issues in the black Escambia community are perceived as opposed to real. The good sheriff goes on to deny the existence of racism because.. Obama. The statistics are that, if were such a racist nation, why do we currently have an African-American president? The problem isnt racism, Sheriff Morgan says, but the acceptance of thug culture among blacks. He described black on white crimes and asks,Wheres the public outrage in that? In earnest, theres always outrage in communities when anyone is killed, but statistics show that nearly 84 percent of white victims were killed by white offenders. From the Washington Post: The 2013 FBI Uniform Crime Report, a compilation of annual crime statistics, also shows similar data: 83 percent of white victims were killed by white offenders; 90 percent of black victims were killed by black offenders; 14 percent of white victims were killed by black offenders; and 7.6 percent of black victims were killed by white offenders. The self proclaimed expert on blackness then calls on the black community tobring back the training of character and integrity to our community because we have raised an asocial generation."
http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/aug/02/usdailynews24/headline-states-debbie-wasserman-schultz-headed-me/,"The biggest story this week was the arrest of Pakistani Muslim and longtime aide of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Imran Awan. Earlier this year, Awan and his two other brothers were caught trying to leave the country with stolen laptops that contained top secret information from various congressmen. Shortly, after the brothers were arrested a criminal investigation commenced and Imran realized that he was going to go to jail for a very long time. In his attempt to avoid facing justice, Awan tried to flee the country but was picked up by police at the Dulles International Airport. This, of course, is scandalous, to say the least, and it was turned up another few notches after Imran hired his lawyer. The lawyer that was hired to defend Imran was no other but a close Clinton family associate and lawyer Chris Gowen.

Here is more from Conservative Review:

In 2012, Gowen went to bat for Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, whose family is deeply connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. After GOP reps explored Abedin’s nefarious ties, Gowen pledged to “stand with Huma.”

Along with his private practice, the longtime Clinton aide is also an adjunct professor at American University Washington College of Law, where he teaches courses on legal ethics and law practice management.

Gowen’s Clinton connections are intriguing on another level, given that Awan’s employer in the House, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, remains a close Clinton confidant. The former Democratic National Committee chair resigned from her position after emails surfaced alleging she attempted to tip the scales of the Democratic primary in Clinton’s favor. Wasserman Schultz was also the 2008 campaign co-chair of Hillary Clinton’s first failed run for president.

Reading this you would think that the mainstream media would be reporting this story non-stop, but that has not occurred at all. In fact, ABC, NBC, and CBS have dedicated a whopping 37 seconds to this political scandal. Of course, that seems ludicrous, but it is obvious that the mainstream media does not want to get to the bottom of this at all. However, that has not stopped Americans from pressing for more information, and the heat is getting Debbie Wasserman Schultz. 

Now, they are reports that Debbie is not fairing well, and has been an absolute wreck since Imran’s arrest. Also, there are calls for Debbie to testify before Congress growing louder, and it seems that she is about to cave.

Here is more from Conservative Fighters:

Debbie Wasserman Schultz employed Pakistani IT staffers and brothers who were paid over $4 million dollars over the course of their employment even though they were accused of a cyber-security breach.

Imran Awan was arrested as he attempted to flee the U.S. after wiring approximately $300,000 to Pakistan. Fox News is the only cable network covering this huge scandal.  When Imran Awan was arrested he was carrying $12,000 in cash on him. His wife was carrying $12,000 of cash when she fled the country too.

Imran and his Muslim brothers, Abid and Jamal accessed unauthorized computers while acting as IT specialists. The three brothers were making $161,000, $165,000, and $160,000 and one of the brothers has a criminal background.

 Word has it that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is an absolute wreck since Imran Awan was arrested. Calls for her to testify to Congress are increasingly growing as well.
Wasserman Schultz knows she’s in hot water over this IT scandal. The Gateway Pundit previously reported the FBI seized smashed hard drives belonging to Imran Awan. We also reported that Debbie Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police with ‘consequences’ for holding equipment that she says belonged to her in order to build a criminal case against a Pakistani IT staffer suspected of massive cyber security breaches.

It is rather clear in watching the video that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has something to hide. Since, why would she threaten the police if there was nothing in the equipment that could point back to her or the Clinton’s?

John Cardillo reports, ‘Florida politicos who have known Wasserman Schultz for years are telling me she’s a nervous wreck, barely able to function since Imran Awan’s arrest.



Then someone witnessed Wasserman Schultz in the midst of an epic meltdown in public. Is it possible that Wasserman Schultz is realzing that the DNC is crumbling all around her now?





This is why alternative news is exploding over the traditional sources of media. The mainstream media is refusing to cover this story but will report the fake Russian collusion story, and President Trump’s ban on transgenders in the military. They will do anything they can to stop the real truth of what is happening in our government to be revealed.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz holds the key to many answers that the American people deserve to know. Hopefully, by keeping the pressure on Wasserman Schultz she will crack and we can get to the bottom of the DNC corruption once and for all.

http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/aug/10/rick-kriseman/was-weather-during-krisemans-term-perfect-storm-se/,"ST. PETERSBURG  For nearly two years, the political stench of a sewage crisis has permeated City Hall. The city's dilapidated sewer system has released up to 186 million gallons of waste into Tampa Bay plus local waterways and streets. The crisis started in August 2015 and hasn't stopped. A federal probe ended without criminal charges, but the state investigation is still ongoing. The city also faces an $810,000 fine on top of the tens of millions needed to fix the problems. The blowback has also fired up the political rhetoric in this summer's mayoral election. SUNSHINE CITY SHOWDOWN: Keep up with the Tampa Bay Times coverage of the St. Petersburg mayoral race. It's Rick vs. Rick: Former mayor Rick Baker will challenge incumbent St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman (May 8, 2017) Rick vs. Rick: Closing Albert Whitted sewage plant could impact St. Petersburg mayor's race (May 29, 2017) In St. Petersburg's mayoral race, Rick Kriseman and Rick Baker rake in the big bucks, exceed $500,000 each (June 8, 2017) Rick vs. Rick: Which St. Petersburg mayor paid the highest salaries at City Hall? (June 12, 2017) Kriseman-Baker debate set for July 25 sponsored by the Times, Bay News 9, St. Pete College (June 20, 2017) FOR MORE COVERAGE: Click here to read all the Times coverage of the mayor's race. Former mayor Rick Baker rarely misses a chance to wedge the city's sewage woes into any stump speech or campaign statement. Incumbent Mayor Rick Kriseman, who has spent months wading through the mess, has found others to blame: Baker and his predecessor, former mayor Bill Foster. The current mayor has said both former mayors failed to adequately maintain the sewer system in the 14 years before he took office. Kriseman said he inherited their mess. So how do their records compare? Which mayor spent the most on sewers, and which mayor spilled the most sewage? The Tampa Bay Times decided to figure that out. Who spilled the most? One question has a clear answer: Under the Kriseman administration, the city says it has discharged nearly 186 million gallons of sewage over the last two summers. That dwarfs the 1.5 million gallons spilled over the eight years Baker spent in office from 2001-10. That means Kriseman is responsible for roughly 124 times as much sewage dumped as Baker. Kriseman acknowledged the sewage gap between his administration and the Baker administration. But, he said, Baker served during several dry years. ""Clearly, there is no comparison in the numbers,"" Kriseman said. ""But we also had wet weather events that he did not experience. He went through significant periods of drought during his time as mayor. ""When you don't have significant rain events, and you're still having spills, you still need to take a look at your system."" However, there were significant rain events during Baker's tenure as mayor, including the 2004 storm season when four hurricanes struck Florida (but missed the Tampa Bay area). And at least one-seventh of his discharge totals were due to a contractor error at the Southwest plant in 2002. Baker scoffed at Kriseman's position, saying the mayor's decision to move forward with the 2015 closure of the waterfront Albert Whitted sewage plant was behind much of Kriseman's troubles. The decision to close one of St. Petersburg's four sewage plants was actually made by a majority of the City Council in 2011, but when it was executed in 2015 it left the city with less capacity. Said Baker: ""He made a huge mistake and he has a dismal record and he's trying to do anything he can to push blame away from himself."" Who spent the most? The Times also wanted to figure out how much had been spent by each mayor on the city's sewer system  not what was budgeted, but what was actually spent. Instead of relying on budgets, the newspaper asked the city to provide actual expenditures including work done on sewage plants and pipes, lift stations and manholes. Both mayors spent lots of money during some years, not so much on others. Baker, who came into office in 2001 a few years after massive spills in the late 1990s, spent most of his tenure complying with a consent order from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The city was released from the order in 2009. ""We invested everything that was recommended to me by either my staff or FDEP under the consent order to get the system to the point where we didn't have spills,"" Baker said. ""It was absolutely a success, what we did."" The city spend the first few years studying the most efficient way to fix the system, Baker said, then did it. The highest year of sewer spending under Baker was 2005 when the city spent $38.5 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. By the end of his second term, when the city was free of state oversight, spending was less than $2 million a year. Kriseman said the Baker administration didn't spend enough to keep the system ahead of the natural curve of deteriorating pipes. ""He had a consent order that had to be followed,"" Kriseman said. ""Logic would seem to say, what was spent was enough to satisfy the consent order. ""But if it had been enough to bring the system up to future needs, we wouldn't have dealt with issues we dealt with."" Kriseman's sewer spending started out low, with just about $3.5 million in 2014, a budget year he shared with Foster. City spending under his tenure didn't ramp up until the spills began in 2015. Now, the city is in the midst of a $304 million sewer system fix, much of which is mandated by another pending state consent order. The city has spent $57 million so far this year  a high for both the Baker and Kriseman years. To blame or not to blame? Kriseman points to that spending as evidence that he is investing enough to keep the city's sewers operating safely for years to come. And, the mayor said, he wants to make clear that he's not interested in past mistakes, just fixing the current problems. ""This is not a blame game, we don't have time to place blame,"" he said. ""We're trying to make progress."" Baker said Kriseman's desire to not place blame for the problem shows that he's not taking responsibility for his administration's mistakes: ""This attitude reflects Kriseman's leadership style  spend two years blaming the weather, city employees and past administrations, never take responsibility for closing Albert Whitted in 2015 and dumping 200 million gallons of sewage and now crying foul when he's held accountable.""

Spending on two signature projects, a new police headquarters and a new Pier, have mushroomed. The city needs a new police station, and it has had a Pier for generations. But the prices have grown more than 70 percent since inception, now hovering around $80 million apiece. At City Hall, cost is of no concern when building legacy landmarks. Police headquarters and shooting range How $50 million became $85 million 2006: $50 million That is the initial estimate to replace the department's aging, cramped headquarters. 2011: $32 million A slumping economy forces city leaders to plan a smaller building while refurbishing the existing headquarters. 2013: $40 million Under Mayor Bill Foster, plans move forward for a scaled-down project. 2015: $70 million The economy rebounds to make $50 million in Penny for Pinellas sales tax money available. Mayor Rick Kriseman abandons the scaled down version and adds $20 million to build a brand new complex in one phase. 2016: $81 million The price jumps to pay for a secure parking garage and new shooting range. 2017: $85 million The price rises another $4 million to pay for additional parking spaces and energy efficiency features. The final product will be a 167,500-square-foot station at 1301 First Ave. N that can withstand a Category 4 hurricane. Plans also call for a secure parking garage next door and a new shooting range. Construction could start this spring. The new Pier How $46 million became $80 million 2013: $46 million Of the original $50 million budget, $4 million was spent on the Lens, which voters rejected in a referendum. 2013: $66 million: A month after City Council members approved a new design, known as Pier Park, Kriseman proposes another $20 million for features linking the Pier to downtown. 2016: $80 million: After escalating costs force some Pier features to be removed, Kriseman wants to add $14 million in ""enhancements"" to make the Pier better, using funds freed up from a failed transit referendum. If approved, the enhancements would include: $3.4 million: Water recreation zone including floating docks, flight deck and kayak barn $1.6 million: expanded pavilion with cafe, more shade and restrooms $1.3 million: playground and splash pad enhancements $2.6 million: ""destination differentiators,"" described as a signature art element, market stalls and a signature recreational element $1.68 million: movable fixtures and equipment such as outdoor furnishings, bike racks and a sound stage and lighting; The new Pier would be a four-level structure over the water facing downtown with a restaurant. The entire 26-acre district would feature a lawn that hosts concerts, educational areas, a ""coastal thicket"" of native plants, a welcome center plaza with a covered tram stop, playground and splash pad, fishing areas and kayak rentals and a second restaurant near the marina."

PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNS VA CHOICE BILL On Saturday, August 12, President Trump signed the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act into law.

It allows veterans caught in long waiting lists to seek care from private clinics or doctors, then bill the cost of the visit back to the VA. Making the VA better for the brave men and women who have served our country is important to me. I voted for this bill when it was in the House, and I am glad to see that it has been signed into law. CONGRESS THIS YEAR State and local governments that do not comply with our immigration laws are putting American citizens at risk. The facts are clear: the U.S. Sentencing Commission found that in 2014, 75% of all criminal defendants who were convicted and sentenced for federal drug offenses were illegal aliens. As of 2014, illegal aliens made up roughly 3.5% of our population, and committed over 10% of all murders. In 2016, well over 50 percent of ICE removals had already been convicted of previous crimes. I shouldnt have to remind anyone of the tragic death of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle. On July 1, 2015, as she walked with her father in San Francisco, she was struck and killed by a stray bullet. The man who shot the gun was an illegal immigrant with 7 previous felony convictions, including convictions for manufacturing heroin. Across sanctuary cities nationwide, there are thousands more stories of innocent lives lost, of families destroyed, of crimes that could have been prevented were the citys policies different. On June 29, the House passed H.R. 3004, Kates Law, a bill supported by a majority of Americans. This bill significantly increases penalties for illegal aliens who re-enter the United States after having been deported. San Franciscos sanctuary city policies failed the Steinle family, and endanger countless families across America. I commend the Department of Justice for continuing to crack down on sanctuary cities, whose policies threaten the safety and security of Americans. We cannot keep rewarding cities who put their people at risk. AROUND THE DISTRICT School Visits On Wednesday, August 16, I visited the L.E.A.D.

I am struck by the double standard and hypocrisy of those who are offended by this executive order, but who failed to challenge President Obama when he took similar action against Cuban refugees; especially since President Obamas action was meant to appease the Castro regime and not for national security reasons. While it is always legitimate to express concerns with presidential executive orders, I understand the Presidents primary responsibility is to keep the American people safe. The ban is only temporary until the Administration can review and enact the necessary procedures to vet immigrants from these countries. The ban is based on countries the Obama administration identified as countries of concern and not based on a religious test. ###"

The building, designed by Eric Trump, was supposed to be able to withstand bunker-busting bombs. He told the National Report that the reason the water was able to penetrate was simple physics:

“I designed the building for an air raid. Who would ever think that the threat would come from the side? Those walls were just normal walls to keep cost down. The roof was what was designed to absorb the impact. Mass equals force times accelarated ions.”

http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2018/apr/04/free-thought-project/did-florida-police-seize-mans-gun-out-due-process-/,"Spread the love UPDATE: Politifact has called this article false, claiming police told them that the man voluntarily surrendered his weapons. If this is true, that information was not available at the time this article was written, nor was it cited in the original piece by the Sun-Sentinel. The Free Thought Project explained the reasoning behind our original article in an interview with Politifact. Below is that exchange: Hi Allison, thanks for reaching out. In both of the cases mentioned below, neither of the two men were suspected of committing a crime, nor had they committed a crime. Under the fifth and fourteenth amendments, due process clauses are in place to act as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property by the government outside the sanction of law. Whats more, neither of the men were granted their sixth amendment rights to be confronted with the witnesses against them. In both cases, simple ordersunder new lawswere issued, arguably arbitrarily, which stripped these two men of their property. As I explained in the article. These men had their guns confiscated based on the accusations of others, only. When a person is stripped of their constitutional rights, albeit temporarily, without being given the chance to make their own case based on what can be entirely arbitrary accusations, this is the removal of due process. This is why I gave examples of how these red flag laws can be abused by both law enforcement, spouses, or any group of people who wants to ruin a persons life by making up threatening stories about others. In Florida, the man couldve been baker acted, prior to having his guns taken, and then deemed a threat to himself or others by a psychologist. This is not a perfect system, but at least it has a semblance of due process. Regardless of the court issuing an order, no crime had been committed and law enforcement was acting on hearsay only. Hopefully you see the danger in such measures and why we feel it necessary to point them out. No one wants dangerous mentally ill people to have access to weapons, but no one wants gun grabs in the middle of the night from innocent people who have only been accused of acting strangely either. When someone is accused of being a threat, bring that person in, question them, evaluate them, then decide whether or not he needs to have his guns removed. This is what due process looks like, not the other way around. Hope that clears it up. In the original questioning by Politifact, TFTP was asked why we thought the confiscation removed a mans due process. Politifact referred to this as a confiscation which is why we replied with the above information. However, only after this interview did Politifact reveal previously unpublished information about the man voluntarily surrendering his arms. At no time did TFTP ever set out to intentionally deceive of mislead people as the case in point is described above. However, given this new information, we have changed the title of this piece to reflect the new information. Below is the original article. Broward, FL  In whats being called the first gun confiscation of its kind in Florida, police have taken four guns and a couple hundred rounds of ammunition from a 56-year-old Lighthouse Point man. The man was not tried, had not committed a crime, and the guns were solely removed because experts deemed him a threat. The guns and ammunition have been temporarily removed from the man under the states new risk protection law, which is also sometimes called red flag legislation, Lighthouse Point City Attorney Michael Cirullo confirmed, according to the Sun-Sentinal. We know its the first case of its kind in Broward County and we think its the first one in Florida, under the new law, Cirullo said. Up until the introduction of this law last week, there was no process for us to protect the public in this kind of situation. In Florida, prior to passing the new gun control law, people deemed psychologically unfit could be involuntarily hospitalized under what is called the Baker Act. During this involuntary admission to a hospital, the person is evaluated to determine if they are a risk to themselves or others. Only after they had been psychologically evaluated and deemed a threat could the government then move in to temporarily disarm them. Now, however, this tiny bit of due process is no longer necessary and experts can simply deem someone a threat and take their guns. Although the 56-year-old man was subsequently Baker Act-ed, his guns were taken before this happened. To illustrate the insidious nature of Floridas new bill and its rights-violating implications, prior to the new legislation, if police would have done what they did to this 56-year-old mantaken his guns with no due processthey would be fired and fined up to $5,000. It is important to note that this man was certainly acting strangely and, according to the Sun-Sentinal, he told officers he was being targeted and burglarized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a neighbor who lives in (his) building, the judge wrote in his order. (He) could not describe the neighbor but stated that the neighbor shape shift, he can change heights and Im not sure where he comes from and to be honest, he looks like Osama Bin Laden.' He also turned off all of his power to the apartment he lived in. By all means, he was acting very strangely. However, he still deserved due process. It will now be up to the man to prove that he is healthy enough to ever be able to get his guns back again. To be clear, no one here is advocating for people determined to be mentally unfit to be able to possess firearms. However, they need to be determined to be mentally unfit before they lose their rights. This law was a reaction to the shooting in Parkland, however, it is important to point out that there were already laws on the books that shouldve stopped Nikolas Cruz from ever getting a gun. Citing Cruz as the reason for advocating the removal of due process, the anti-gun activists are claiming he shouldve had his guns taken which would have prevented the tragedy. Sadly, however, they are ignoring the fact that he was accused of multiple feloniesand shouldve never been able to purchase a gun in the first placebut law enforcement failed to act on any of it. In Florida, if a person making death threats intends for the victim to fear for her safety, specifically fearful of death or bodily harm, it is considered a credible threat under the law, which changes the crime from stalking, a first-degree misdemeanor, to aggravated stalking, a felony of the third degree. Cruz was reported at least 4 times for this very crime before he bought his AR-15 and police did nothing. Floridas law also mirrors another due process-removing law that was recently used in Washington state to remove a mans guns. As TFTP reported earlier this month, there is a law on the books known as the Extreme Risk Protection Order or ERPO, which went into effect in June of 2017. This law is used when a person is considered an extreme threat as reported by police and family members. An ERPO must be approved by a judge and only after this person is proven to be a danger to themselves or others can police move in to confiscate their weapons. We now have to go to someones house and knock on the door and say, Were from the government. Can we have your guns? Seattle police Sgt. Eric Pisconski told KIRO Radios Dave Ross. That can get very dangerous. While touted as a necessary tool for police, an ERPO and Floridas new law both remove due process as the person who is accused of being mentally unstable does not have to be present and gets no chance of facing their accuser. To those who may be in favor of such laws, consider the following: There is no way to stop an estranged spouse from call police repeatedly and telling them their ex is threatening to cause harm to others. While the man in Florida had his guns taken for being psychologically unfit, the man in Seattle simply open-carried a pistol and looked out of windows and his guns were taken because his neighbors thought it was strange. Anyone, any time, now has the ability to claim someone else is a threat and have police take their guns. One does not need to delve into the multiple what if scenarios to see what sort of ominous implications arise from such a practice. Whats more, police now have the power to deem you a threat at any time and legally disarm youdue process be damned. This is the exact scenario that Donald Trump advocated for in February. Last month, notorious gun-grabber Senator Dianne Feinstein, sat next to Donald Trump and likely salivated over his remarks as he called for the removal of due process and to take the guns first. Now, police are doing just that. To those that support the removal of due process under the ostensible notion that it would make you safer, you would do well to remember history before you or someone you know finds yourself subject to these very laws."

According to a breaking report by The Columbian Post, Hogg states “On the day of the shooting, I got my camera and got on my bike and rode as fast as I could three miles from my house to the school to get as much video and to get as many interviews as I could because I knew that this could not be another mass shooting.”

Hogg makes no mention of why he was not at school, or how he heard about the shooting, and the interviewer never questions either of these details.

More notably, this completely debunks an article by Time, where Hogg details his account of the events of the shooting:

“When Hogg heard a “pop” while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, he told his teacher it sounded strangely like a gunshot. But there had been a fire drill that very morning and talk of a “Code Red” exercise to prepare for an active shooter. This must just be a surprise drill, he reasoned.”

As for the students tragically killed in the shooting and currently being used to promote gun control, Hogg admits that he didn’t even know them, “I didn’t know most of these people at a very personal level, but I wanted to make their voices heard and that’s what I’m really trying to do.” 

Hogg’s of being at home during the shooting, and riding his bike to the school begin just after the 4:30 mark. You can watch the excerpt below:"

Mitt Romney threw his support behind Georgia Republican Karen Handel on Wednesday, the day after she finished first in the governors primary. Romney joins former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in backing Handel, the former secretary of state who took 34 percent of the vote in Tuesdays seven-way primary. Shell face Nathan Deal, who took 23 percent of the vote, in the Aug.10 runoff. Deal, who resigned from Congress after nine terms in March to focus on his campaign, has the backing of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Story Continued Below A successful businesswoman and public servant, Karen Handels blend of executive, political, and business experience is just what Georgia needs at this critical time, Romney said in a statement. The leadership skills that she has honed in both the private and public sectors will enable her to make tough decisions and enact the reforms needed to get the economy back on track and foster job creation. The former 2008 presidential candidate and possible 2012 GOP hopeful also donated $1,000 to Handels campaign. Handel spokesman Dan McLagan told POLITICO they are hopeful Palin will campaign for Handel at some point during the runoff and the two camps are working to coordinate schedules now. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who also backed Handel in the primary, could also make an appearance with Handel on the trail. But one group that wont be lining up behind Handel is the Georgia Right to Life. Despite earning Palins endorsement last week, the states pro-life chapter withheld their stamp of approval from Handel in the primary, and launched a blistering robocall on Monday urging voters not to pick the only female candidate in the race. While they didnt single out one candidate as their preference, they did endorse five candidates in the race as meeting thei pro-life thresholdDeal, state Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, state Senate President Eric Johnson and communications executive Ray McBerry. And now that its a two-person race, the group is firmly in Deals corner. I would say that we definitely will get involved as much as we can financially and throw our support behind Nathan Deal, Melanie Crozier, executive director of the Georgia Right to Life political action committee, told POLITICO. The pro-life organization took particular issue with Handels support for abortions in the case of rape and incest and said she didnt support enough restrictions to in vitro fertilization. Because of those positions, Crozier said her organization was surprised by Palins endorsement, but said it was just another example of Palin trying to pick a winning female candidate. [Palin] has a son with Downs Syndrome, and under Karen Handels laws, Handel would have felt like it was ok to go in and abort that child, said Crozier. But when you look at Sarah Palins patterngoing out finding mainly women candidates that were in the lead and endorsing them, thats not really a surprise. She saw Handel had a decent lead, so I think she sort of jumped on the bandwagon. Crozier said the field has the potential to shift, and believes the other candidates they endorsed will line up behind Deal because he is the true conservative. Handels campaign was quick out of the gate Wednesday with a memo touting her advantages heading into the three-week runoff stretch, reminding reporters that no modern state second-place finisher has ever leaped ahead to win the runoff when the difference was larger than 1.2 percent, and noted only two runners-up had won in the past 16 years. McLagan said RTLs resistance to Handel was old news and said the abortion exceptions she backs are in line with the National Right to Life. Correction: An earlier version of this story reported that Handel spokesman Dan McLagan said Sarah Palin was likely to campaign for Handel. McLagen said they are hopeful Palin will campaign and they are working to coordinate schedules."

http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2010/jun/13/kevin-levitas/state-rep-says-georgia-sets-gold-standard-food-saf/,"Today, Governor Sonny Perdue signed into law House Bill 883, the SAFE Act, authored by State Representative Kevin Levitas (D-Atlanta). The bill, known as the Sanitary Activity for Food-Processing Enterprises (SAFE) Act, would allow for felony punishment if a food processor knowingly releases tainted food products into the public resulting in injury or death to consumers. Georgia has a well-deserved reputation for setting the gold standard for food safety, and the SAFE Act continues our states long tradition of protecting the consuming public, said Rep. Levitas. An overwhelming majority of food processors in Georgia keep quality and safety as their primary concerns. The SAFE Act is intended to keep out the bad actors and punish the few who put profit over human life and safety. The new law will strengthen Georgias current food safety laws by adding greater protections for consumers. Rep. Levitas, who co-chairs the House Subcommittee on Consumer Protection Investigation and Oversight, said that hours of subcommittee testimony from a number of witnesses convinced him of the need for the SAFE Act. In addition to punishing food processors who knowingly release tainted products that cause harm to the public, the SAFE Act requires that every food processor maintain a written sanitization plan at its facility to make plant inspections easier to conduct. It also imposes criminal sanctions on those who withhold food tests from inspectors, which could indicate the presence of food-borne pathogens. Rep. Levitas noted that the SAFE Act builds upon the foundation laid by passage of Senate Bill 80 during the 2009 legislative session of the General Assembly, which became law last year. Senator Bulloch broke new ground with the passage of SB 80, which has become model food safety legislation for other states across the country to follow, said Rep. Levitas. The SAFE Act builds upon the Senators great work and furthers the goals of protecting the public and ensuring that Georgias gold-standard reputation remains strong. ### Representative Kevin Levitas represents the citizens of District 82, which includes portions of DeKalb County. He was elected into the House of Representatives in 2006, and currently is the Secretary of the Judiciary Non-Civil Committee. He also serves on the Science and Technology, Agriculture and Consumer Affairs, and Transportation Committees as well as on the Special Committee on Small Business Development and Job Creation."

http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/oct/07/beverly-hall/former-aps-head-beverly-hall-says-national-test-pr/,"Commentary Beverly Hall: The Scandal Is Not the Whole Story Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution Atlanta's former superintendent on the cheating scandal and its fallout Scandal is the news, but its not always the story. I know, because the Atlanta public schools, which I ran for 12 years until I retired in June, are embroiled in cheating allegations that rightly are the focus of extraordinary media coverage. Yet there is a growing danger that this disgraceful situation will set back national educational reform, when it could ironically advance it. There is no excuse for cheating, and I deeply regret that I did not do more to prevent it. The challenge now, even as law-enforcement agencies go about their business, is to learn from all of this and ensure that our nations schools are improved by itbecause the problem of cheating is not unique to Atlanta. According to The New York Times, Allegations of cheating have erupted in several places, including Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, and Los Angeles. It greatly saddens me that security for state tests, after they were administered in 2009, was not sufficient to prevent tampering. That security was consistent with standard protocols, but, because the tests had to remain at the schools for several days, there were clearly opportunities for tampering that should have been prevented and were not. In hindsight, I would also more closely monitor the test administration in the classroom, which is now done on a heightened basis. Safe rooms have also been created in the past year in every Atlanta public school for the purpose of securing tests. These safe rooms have cameras monitoring them constantly, and the few people with authorized access must sign in and out. The results of the standardized tests administered in 2010 and 2011 under this enhanced security indicate that dramatic improvement in test scores has remained. That improvement has also been confirmed by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, which is independently administered. NAEP indicates that Atlanta public school students are performing at significantly higher levels than in the past. ""There is no excuse for cheating, and I deeply regret that I did not do more to prevent it."" Thats the story thats being lost. The progress made by Atlantas public schools over the past decade is real and dramatic. In 2000, according to Georgias state testing, 47 percent of the districts 4th graders, for example, were reading at levels that met or exceeded state standards. In 2011, under the strictest testing conditions, 80 percent were performing at acceptable levels. This trend is evident across most grades and subjects. Those dramatic increases are not the result of score manipulation. They are the result of the hard work of turning around a struggling school system. When I arrived in Atlanta, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported, Ninety percent of the systems kindergarten teachers said they did not believe their pupils would graduate (from high school). The situation was dire, and a complete overhaul was needed. My team and I implemented research-based practices proven to teach effectively to standardsnot to teach to tests. ""As awful as this cheating scandal is, it would be even more awful if we learned the wrong lesson from it. The culprit is not standardized testing or teacher accountability. We need both."" We changed the way teachers were teaching: We introduced new models, provided professional development, instituted common preparation times so teachers could support each other in improving their delivery of instruction, and designated master teachers and model-support teachers. We provided students with support: We created Saturday academies, offered after-school programs, increased the number of social workers in schools serving the most economically disadvantaged students, and enhanced access to social-service agencies that could help address problems at home. We redefined the role of principalsemphasizing instructional leadership over bureaucratic administration. We used state curriculum standards as guides and set performance targets for individual schools, based on each schools performance the year before. Those targets were intentionally aggressive, but not unrealistic. Should I have anticipated cheating, based on dramatic gains in test scores? With hindsight, I wish I had. But there was every reason to believe that our dramatic restructuring would produce dramatic results, as it has. And those results continue to be confirmed by tests that have been independently administered and completed under the tightest security. As awful as this cheating scandal is, it would be even more awful if we learned the wrong lesson from it. The culprit is not standardized testing or teacher accountability. We need both. We must continue to implement the best practices described above, set high standards, and measure success. Our nations children depend on it.

http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/aug/06/nathan-deal/deal-claim-he-fulfilled-toll-promise-needs-major-r/,"Fulfilling his promise to commuters, Gov. Nathan Deal today announced that he will have the state pay off its bond debt on Dec. 1, 2013, and move rapidly after that to remove the Ga. 400 toll by the end of that year. This will stop collection four years earlier than previously planned. Ga. 400 commuters have paid more than their fair share already, and this is the earliest we can bring it down without paying a penalty for early repayment of the bonds, Deal said. When the Ga. 400 toll went up, the state of Georgia promised commuters that it wasnt forever. If we dont keep that promise, we lose the faith of the people. We face many challenges when it comes to paying for new capacity, particularly in the Atlanta region. There are no easy answers, no secret pots of money, but it is imperative that governments build the trust of their people. As your governor, I will keep the promises I make to you. The Ga. 400 toll was originally scheduled to come down after 20 years, ending in 2011. In 2010  after then-candidate Deal promised to end the toll the following year  the state issued new bonds tied to the toll revenue in order to pay for needed improvements in the Ga. 400 corridor, including a new connector to I-85. The $40 million in new bonds were issued Dec. 1, 2010, and they mature June 1, 2017. But at the three-year mark the state can repay the bonds without a penalty. Further, the state needs time to plan for physically bringing down the gates and the dramatic restructuring that will be needed in the toll area. As I have said many times before: I inherited a situation where we could not bring down the gates immediately, and we face a situation where we would have to pay a penalty for early repayment, Deal said. This timeline gives commuters a finish line, while still allowing us to meet our obligations. Moving forward, well need to continue to work on long-term solutions to congestion in the 400 corridor. And I look forward to doing that in a transparent fashion that commuters can trust. The governor's proposal requires approval of the State Road and Tollway Authority."
http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/nov/28/michael-cannon/experts-say-federal-law-trumps-state-law-obamacare/,"Republican Governors Association chairman Bob McDonnell (R.,Va.) Now is not the time to go wobbly. President Obama has won reelection, and his administration has asked state officials to decide by Friday, November 16, whether their state will create one of Obamacares health-insurance exchanges. States also have to decide whether to implement the laws massive expansion of Medicaid. The correct answer to both questions remains a resounding no. State-created exchanges mean higher taxes, fewer jobs, and less protection of religious freedom. States are better off defaulting to a federal exchange. The Medicaid expansion is likewise too costly and risky a proposition. Republican Governors Association chairman Bob McDonnell (R.,Va.) agrees, and has announced that Virginia will implement neither provision. Advertisement Advertisement There are many arguments against creating exchanges. First, states are under no obligation to create one. Second, operating an Obamacare exchange would be illegal in 14 states. Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, and Virginia have enacted either statutes or constitutional amendments (or both) forbidding state employees to participate in an essential exchange function: implementing Obamacares individual and employer mandates. Advertisement Third, each exchange would cost its state an estimated $10 million to $100 million per year, necessitating tax increases. Fourth, the November 16 deadline is no more real than the deadlines for implementing REAL ID, which have been pushed back repeatedly since 2008. Fifth, states can always create an exchange later if they choose. #ad#Sixth, a state-created exchange is not a state-controlled exchange. All exchanges will be controlled by Washington. Advertisement Seventh, Congress authorized no funds for federal fallback exchanges. So Washington may not be able to impose exchanges on states at all. Eighth, the Obama administration has yet to provide crucial information that states need before they can make an informed decision. Ninth, creating an exchange sets state officials up to take the blame when Obamacare increases insurance premiums and denies care to the sick. State officials wont want their names on this disastrous mess. Tenth, creating an exchange would be assisting in the creation of a public option that would drive domestic health-insurance carriers out of business through unfair competition. Advertisement Eleventh, Obamacare remains unpopular. The latest Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that only 38 percent of the public supports it. Twelfth, defaulting to a federal exchange exempts a states employers from the employer mandate  a tax of $2,000 per worker per year (the tax applies to companies with more than 50 employees, but for such companies that tax applies after the 30th employee, not the 50th). If all states did so, that would also exempt 18 million Americans from the individual mandates tax of $2,085 per family of four. Avoiding those taxes improves a states prospects for job creation, and protects the conscience rights of employers and individuals whom the Obama administration is forcing to purchase contraceptives coverage. Finally, rejecting an exchange reduces the federal deficit. Obamacare offers its deficit-financed subsidies to private health insurers only through state-created exchanges. If all states declined, federal deficits would fall by roughly $700 billion over ten years. For similar reasons, states should decline to implement Obamacares Medicaid expansion. The Supreme Court gave states that option. All states should exercise it. Medicaid is rife with waste and fraud. It increases the cost of private health care and insurance, crowds out private health insurance and long-term-care insurance, and discourages enrollees from climbing the economic ladder. There is scant reliable evidence that Medicaid improves health outcomes, and no evidence that it is a cost-effective way of doing so. My colleague Jagadeesh Gokhale estimates that expanding Medicaid will cost individual states up to $53 billion over the first ten years. Thats before an emboldened President Obama follows through on his threats to shift more Medicaid costs to states. Advertisement Neither the states nor the federal government have the money to expand Medicaid. If all states politely decline, federal deficits will shrink by another $900 billion. Now is not the time to go wobbly. Obamacare is still harmful and still unpopular. The presidential election was hardly a referendum, as it pitted the first person to enact Obamacare against the second person to enact it. Since the election, many state officials are reaffirming their opposition to both implementing exchanges and expanding Medicaid. If enough states do so, Congress will have no choice but to reopen Obamacare. With a GOP-controlled House, opponents will be in a much stronger position than they were when this harmful law was enacted.  Michael F.

http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/jul/12/larry-elder/claim-deen-backed-obama-lacks-key-ingredients/,"If Paula Deen is out because of her decades-old private use of the ""n"" word, what about its public and private use by MSNBC's Al Sharpton? What about HBO host Bill Maher's use of the ""c"" word? The crisis Deen must deal with confirms the observation of John O'Sullivan, a former editor of National Review: ""White racism exists, but its social power is weak; the social power against it, overwhelming."" Deen has  so far  lost her show on the Food Network and her spokesperson gig for Smithfield Foods. QVC, Sears, Wal-Mart and others are deciding whether to continue their relationship with the embattled chef. What did the 66-year-old native of Georgia do that now threatens their enterprises? In a deposition given in a harassment lawsuit filed by a white ex-employee at a Deen family-owned restaurant, Deen admitted using the ""n-word"" in the past, during a private conversation: ""When a black man burst into the bank that I was working at and put a gun to my head,"" she said, ""I didn't feel real favorable to him."" Deen says she didn't use the word during the holdup, but ""probably"" used it later, ""in telling my husband."" Asked if she ever used the word again, Deen responded, ""I'm sure I have, but it's been a very long time."" When pressed to recall specific instances, Deen could not, saying: ""I don't know, maybe in repeating something that was said to me . .. But that's just not a word that we use as time has gone on. Things have changed since the '60s in the South. And my children and my brother object to that word being used in any cruel or mean behavior, as well as I do."" Deen has, so far, apologized, apologized and apologized. That the ex-employee is white, not black, and worked for her for five years did not seem to matter. Nor does it seem to matter that others have not come forward to corroborate her alleged racism. Does she refuse to hire blacks? Has she mistreated them or paid them below the wages of white workers? And, for what it's worth, Deen supported and campaigned for Barack Obama. If Deen's crime is the private use of the n-word, why does the Rev. Al Sharpton, who hosts a nightly hour-long show on MSNBC, get a pass? Sharpton rocketed to fame by falsely accusing two white men of raping and sodomizing black teenager Tawana Brawley. A New York grand jury investigation concluded the whole case was fraudulent and that Brawley flat-out lied to avoid punishment for staying out too late. To this day, Sharpton refuses to apologize to former Assistant District Attorney Steven Pagones, one of the men Sharpton accused of rape, even after a jury found Sharpton liable for defamation. One of Sharpton's top aides became so disgusted with the farce that he turned against his boss. Sharpton, the former aide said, could not have cared less whether Brawley was telling the truth because, according to Sharpton, ""We beat this, we will be the biggest n--gers in New York."" Sharpton called the former Marine, magna cum laude graduate, lawyer, professor and then-Mayor David Dinkins  New York City's first and only black mayor  a ""n--ger whore."" Apparently MSNBC and the Food Network see the ""n"" word differently. Sharpton has called Jews ""diamond merchants"" and described whites moving businesses into Harlem as ""interlopers."" He helped incite three days of anti-Semitic rioting in Crown Heights, where two people died and over 100 were wounded. A Columbia University professor called Crown Heights ""a modern-day pogrom."" Then there's Freddy's Fashion Mart. A Jewish store owner in Harlem was accused of driving a black record store subtenant out of business by raising his rent. At a rally meant to scare the Jewish owner away, Sharpton said: ""There is a systematic and methodical strategy to eliminate our people from doing business off 125th Street. I want to make it clear ... that we will not stand by and allow them to move this brother so that some white interloper can expand his business."" Later, one of the protesters, a black man, stormed Freddy's Fashion Mart with a pistol, screaming: ""It's on now! All blacks out!"" In addition to the shooting, he set fire to the building, eventually killing seven before turning the gun on himself. If Deen is out because of the ""n"" word, what about HBO's Bill Maher? On more than one occasion, he has publicly called Sarah Palin the ""c"" word. He has called her a ""dumb tw-t""  a slang word for female genitalia. He has described her son Trig, who has Down syndrome, as ""retarded."" But, to be fair, neither Sharpton nor Maher  at least to our knowledge  has called Palin the ""n"" word. That must explain it."

http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/georgia-didnt-ban-muslim-culture-macedonian-websit/,"When Donald Trump proposed in 2015 that we place a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, it was at a time when Europe was experiencing historical levels of migrations and terrorism. ISIS was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed.

Whether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the Paris bombings, or even the German priest that was beheaded for being a Christian–they all were fueled by Islam. People need to understand that Islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the United States.
A Georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional Muslim veils.

State Rep. Jason Spencer (R) filed legislation on Wednesday that would prevent women from posing for driver’s license photos while wearing a veil. The measure also adds burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving.

Spencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about Islamic terrorism. Spencer’s bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk.

“This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us,” Spencer told WSB-TV in Atlanta.

Many people will immediately read this and argue that the First Amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms, and that is a true and correct argument. Our Constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose.

Here is the problem: Islam is not a religion. It is a cancerous disease that calls for all Christians, women, and homosexuals to be brutally murdered for the false god Allah. A vast majority of terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of Allah. When was the last time we experienced a terrorist attack from someone citing the Bible?

Quran 8:12: I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.
Quran 9:29: Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.
Quran 3:151: Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority.
Is that what we want to blossom in our country, schools, and communities?

Just for starters, Liberals already banned school prayer because Christian values may offend someone–so how is this any different?

There is a difference between a hijab and burqa. Spencer is arguing that we should ban the full-on cover that cloaks women from head to toe.

While Liberals will decry this action, they better accept it because it will have a snowball effect in the United States. Outside of Georgia, several other states are starting to propose similar legislation.

The threat of Islam and those that practice it are so severe that France and Belgium have banned burqas and similar coverings altogether to try and keep citizens safe. Local governments in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland have also instituted bans.

This move is about keeping the American people safe. Under President Trump, we will do whatever is necessary to keep the American people safe.

http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2017/nov/13/michael-williams-georgia/did-bump-stocks-prevent-more-casualties-las-vegas/,"Republican State Senator and candidate for governor, Michael Williams, announced his opposition to regulating or banning bump stocks. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms determined in a 2015 memo that bump stocks are not mechanical, therefore they do not fall under the machine gun weapons ban of 1986. An attack on bump stocks is an attack on the Second Amendment. In solidarity with gun owners across the nation, Michael Williams is giving away a free bump stock to one lucky winner.

Williams said, “The tragedy in Las Vegas broke my heart, but any talk of banning or regulating bump stocks is merely cheap political lip service from career politicians. In reality, the bump stock is the new, shiny object politicians are using to deceive voters into believing they are taking action against gun violence. Many firearms experts determined the Las Vegas shooter’s use of a bump stock actually prevented more casualties and injures due to its inconsistency, inaccuracy, and lack of control. There is zero evidence that banning bump stocks would prevent any gun violence deaths. Georgia’s gun owners deserve a governor who will stand with them when liberals and Hollywood elites attack our fundamental rights. That’s why I am standing for the second amendment and giving away a bump stock as a show of support.”

“If politicians wanted to have a real conversation on reducing gun violence, they would be discussing mental health awareness, and ways to reduce the weekly bloodbath in Chicago and other inner cities. You cannot regulate evil out of existence. Blaming guns or bump stocks for the actions of a lunatic, is the same as blaming McDonald’s for heart disease,” continued Williams. “I will stand up for the Second Amendment against liberals and weak Republicans who wish to limit our freedoms. Not only that, I will continue to call out Democrats and Republicans who provide cheap talk and excuses rather than solutions.”

September 25, 2017: The Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) today announced that it placed 248 counties on notice for holding more registered voters than adult residents in their respective jurisdictions. Officials in 24 states now risk lawsuits if they do not disclose satisfactory data demonstrating effective voter roll maintenance efforts before and after the 2016 Election. During the 2016 Election, 24 states had bloated voter rolls, PILF President and General Counsel J. Christian Adams said. Voter fraud begins with corrupted voter rolls. Our nations voter rolls have records that cannot be distinguished between living or dead; citizen or alien; resident or relocated. We hear about possible cyber-attacks, but we arent doing enough to fix voter rolls that are certainly corrupt. The voter rolls are so bad in some states that election officials would have a hard time telling the difference between sabotage and negligence. Letters mailed to the counties and locales in question note that it appears they are violating the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) because they are not properly maintaining the voter rolls. The NVRA (also known as Motor Voter) requires state and local election officials to properly maintain voter rolls and ensure that only eligible voters are registered. Holding more registrants than living adults indicates that election officials have failed to properly maintain voter rolls. The Public Interest Legal Foundation has a distinguished record of bringing litigation against counties and locales with bloated voter rollsyielding settlements and consent decrees that, if followed properly, will put jurisdictions on a path to more realistic voter registration rates. PILF has been involved in bringing nine separate lawsuits in the last two years to enforce list maintenance provisions of the NVRA, including in Texas, Mississippi, Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania. PILF recently completed the first trial in the history of the NVRA to enforce list maintenance obligations. The case was brought on behalf of the American Civil Rights Union against Broward County, Florida. States with counties that received a notice letter are (# of counties): Kentucky (41), Michigan (32), Iowa (31), Illinois (22), Mississippi (19), Colorado (17), Texas (12), Alabama (12), South Dakota (12), Nebraska (9), Georgia (6), New York (6), West Virginia (6), New Mexico (5), North Carolina (5), California (2), Louisiana (2), Montana (2), Virginia (2), Arizona (1), Florida (1), Missouri (1), Oklahoma (1), and Washington State (1). Kentuckys surpassing Michigan as the most bloated state is particularly concerning giving the Secretary of States belligerent, public refusals to share voter data with the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, despite the States offering of the same information here. Federal law requires election officials to conduct a reasonable effort to maintain voter registration lists free of dead voters, ineligible voters, and voters who have moved away, the notice letters state. Based on our comparison of publicly available information published by the U.S. Census Bureau and the federal Election Assistance Commission, it appears that your jurisdiction is failing to comply with these federal law requirements. The notices seek a variety of documents to clearly discern which jurisdictions are failing to perform basic voter list maintenance duties. Some records sought concern: noncitizen voters; numbers of dead, duplicate, relocated, and felon removals; evidence of use for databases which better identify relocated or alien registrants; and third-party communications about voter rolls, among others. If a local official fails to respond to PILFs letter or declines to allow inspection of election records, they risk a federal lawsuit. A listing off all jurisdictions recently given notice under the NVRA can be found, here. A copy of an example notice letter sent may be reviewed, here. Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) is a 501(c)(3) public interest law firm dedicated to election integrity. The Foundation exists to assist states and others to aid the cause of election integrity and fight against lawlessness in American elections. Drawing on numerous experts in the field, PILF seeks to protect the right to vote and preserve the Constitutional framework of American elections. ###"

Upon completion of the study, it was found that 80% of the black men in Atlanta, Georgia are homosexual.

But supposedly free public schools also charge, in the forms of fees and bribes, leaving the poorest at the same disadvantage. Youd expect Bridges students to do better academically than public school students, and they do. But how much is attributable to family background, and how much to Bridges teaching? A formal evaluation is just beginning. For now, we have Bridges studies. The company recently commissioned a study in Kenya comparing its schools with a control group and controlling for family factors. The results were so-so in math: Bridge students got the equivalent of 13 percent more instruction each year. They were excellent in English, the equivalent of 32 percent more schooling. Liberias partnership project grew from a series of conversations that began last September between Werner and Shannon May, co-founder and chief strategy officer of Bridge. Werner then visited Bridge schools in Kenya and Uganda, talking to parents and teachers. I was awed by what I saw: the ability of children to read and write, the commitment of teachers, the measurement and evaluation mechanisms, the organization, he said in an interview last week. When Sirleaf was in Kenya on a state visit, she too visited a Bridge school. They decided to do a one-year pilot program with Bridge, and if the pilot was successful, to turn more of Liberias primary schools over to Bridge  perhaps eventually all. May jumped at the opportunity. They are paying $78 per kid per year, she said. I said we could do it for $75, and you would get everything you see in Bridge schools now if we could do it at scale. I want to show that the Liberian government can afford a great school. Others were horrified. There had been no competitive bidding, just a unilateral decision to work with one for-profit company. Provision of public education of good quality is a core function of the state, said Kishore Singh, the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to education.

Doing otherwise might meet the definition of reckless child endangerment or even crimes against humanity.” – GGK

Today (2/2/16), investigative reporter Jon Rappaport of nomorefakenews.com/ wrote:

“AP: ‘Brazilian officials said the babies with the defect [microcephaly] and their mothers are being tested to see if they had been infected. Six of the 270 confirmed microcephaly cases were found to have the [Zika] virus.’ Out of all the microcephaly cases re-examined in Brazil, only six have the Zika virus!That constitutes zero proof that Zika has anything to do with microcephaly.”

A glossary of terms for this column:

“The Elephant in the Room”: A situation where there is an obvious root cause of a problem but those falsely claiming to try to solve the problem totally ignore the root cause that is staring them in the face. (Author Upton Sinclair’s incisive comment applies here, when he said: “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it”.)

“Cognitive Dissonance”: The psychological discomfort felt when one is confronted with new information or a new reality that contradicts one’s deeply held beliefs. (As in seeing the sudden explosive collapse (on 9/11/01) of the three WTC towers into fine powder within seconds and the struggling with the desire to stick with the contradictory official White House theory that simple office fires made it happen.)

“Iatrogenic”: A condition, usually inadvertent, resulting from the activity of a physician, such as an adverse reaction to a prescription drug, surgery or vaccine.

“Correlation does not imply Causation”: A example of a logical fallacy in that two events occurring together do not necessarily have a cause-and-effect relationship.

“False Flag Operation”: A covert operation carried out by a government agency, a corporation or some other secret organization in order to deceive its own people into falsely believing the operation was carried out by enemy “others” – usually for political or economic gain. (Ex. Operation Northwoods, Operation Gladio, the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, 9/11/01, the Reichstag Fire, Operation Himmler, etc. (Google “False Flag Ops What Really Happened” for dozens more.)

“Conflict of Interest”: A situation in which a person or group is in a position to derive personal or collective benefit (financial or professional) from actions or decisions made in their official capacity.

Most of us are by now aware of the furor over the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil. Seemingly every pro-corporate vaccinologist, academic pediatrician, infectious disease “expert”, and even the World Health Organization have been blanketing the media and agreeing with the unproven notion that this usually asymptomatic, very mild viral illness somehow caused an “epidemic” of thousands of microcephalic (“shrunken brain”) newborns in , an outbreak that made its appearance out of nowhere in November 2015.

Ignored is the fact that there are 35 other countries across the globe that have confirmed cases of Zika virus illness, but none are having any microcephaly reports (although some public health organizations are searching hard for other cases of microcephaly to support the current conventional “wisdom”).

(See the list of 35 at: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/zika_virus_infection/zika-outbreak/Pages/Zika-countries-with-transmission.aspx)

The public radio stations (NPR, MPR and WPR) that I pay attention to – and usually try hard to trust – have trotted out an assortment of “experts” who have been eager to pontificate on the subject, but none of them have looked at the “elephant in the room”, which is discussed further below. The so-called health professionals from the CDC, the WHO, the NIH and the FDA were academics (or bureaucrats heading up professional organizations) who were specialists in infectious disease, virology, pediatrics, vaccinology and OB-GYN, all professions that have been well indoctrinated in the safety of all vaccines.

All of them were naturally quite willing to fan the flames of fear and paranoia among us lay listeners, and most of us were naturally alarmed to hear about the thousands of mutant  being born with underdeveloped brains.

The Elephant in the Room

But in the whole week of reports that I heard or read about, not a single interviewer asked about – and not a single “expert” or mainstream journalists ever mentioned the most likely triggering cause of the epidemic, and that is the neurotoxic, cytotoxic, genotoxic, aluminum that was in every DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated (early in 2015) by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women – and therefore into their fetuses.d by froontinur,he invitations to be interviewed – even he belief that all vaccines and both safe and effective.

Suspecting that some of the “experts” on the radio may have had professional or economic conflicts of interest in this story, I decided to do some independent research into what else might be behind last week’s three hysteria-provoking, media-hyped stories. Besides

(1) the Zika virus/microcephaly story, there were two other paranoia-inducing reports in the news that I noticed, including

(2) a report about a new kind of dog influenza virus that allegedly made somebody’s cute little Jack Russell terrier very sick with a cough (for which your local veterinarian apparently has a vaccine) and

(3) a preventive medical services “blue ribbon” panel that was recommended that every person in America henceforth should be screened for so-called “mental illnesses” (and then referred to physicians who are quick to prescribe unaffordable, brain-altering psychotropic medications, of course).

We all know how pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers (as well as clinics, hospitals and physician trade associations) are constantly trying to grow their businesses and enrich themselves and their stakeholders (by expanding market share whenever and wherever they can). So naturally I couldn’t help but speculate on which financial investment sectors and corporations were benefitting from the latest freak-out news this time around.

Andrew Bridgen Suspended as Conservative MP for Criticising COVID Vaccines
Cognitive Dissonance (or is it Willful Ignorance) in the Healthcare Industries?

It’s important to be aware of the unshakable faith that Big Medicine has in Big Pharma’s vaccines. As a family physician, I was likewise indoctrinated in medical school and beyond to believe that all mercury-containing or aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines are safe and effective and that both mercury and aluminum were non-toxic. (Both now are well-known to be serious poisons to every living cell in the universe, not just babies brains.) Generations of brain-washing of the medical profession by corporate-controlled or corporate-influenced professionals – has worked wonders for the vaccine industry, and it starts in medical school. And what physicians believe firmly extends to their patients, even in the face of powerful neuroscientific evidence to the contrary.

Even the Brazilian women who have been delivering their microcephalic babies (or autistic, learning impaired, hyperactive, antisocial, autoimmune, or otherwise neurologically-impaired later in childhood) are probably unaware that they and their fetuses had been exposed to injected neurotoxins (without their fully informed consent being given) when their fetuses were developing their brains, nerves and synapses.

And I’ll even be willing to bet that those healthcare workers who were delivering those babies had no clue either.

Significantly, it is even possible that some of those women were also receiving the mercury-containing flu shots during their pregnancy as well. Knowing that both toxic heavy metals are capable of crossing both the placental barrier and the immature blood-brain barrier of the fetus, those chemicals should have been contraindicated in pregnancy.

At this point, it must be recognized that those Brazilian mothers – usually living in poverty, malnutrition and in carcinogenic areas of the nation – have been chronically exposed also to Monsanto’s Round-up (a known neurotoxin that has shown brain toxicity and small brains in experimental animal testing), Syngenta’s Atrazine (another neurotoxic and genotoxic herbicide widely used in Brazil), mosquito repellants and fumigation with neurotoxins).

Brazil is notorious for the widespread use of toxic chemicals because of their burgeoning agricultural economy. It is the largest user of agribusiness poisons in the world. (Be careful about eating food from Brazil, which will be hard if Big Agribusiness and the Grocery Manufacturers of America (GMA) succeed in banning the labeling of food products as to country of origin.)

I know of no pediatrician and very few family physicians that show any sign of recognition whenever the darling of Big Vaccine, Dr Paul Offit speaks. (Offit is the multi-millionaire inventor of a CDC-mandated rotavirus vaccine whose contagious live viruses are shed for weeks following the oral administration of the vaccine.) Offit, an academic pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, where he is the director of the Vaccine Education Center, once made the ridiculous assertion that “infants can theoretically receive 10,000 vaccine (antigens) at once without overloading their immune systems.” Despite that outrageous belief, he seems to have open invitations to be interviewed on radio or TV anytime there is an outbreak of whooping cough or measles-like rashes among fully vaccinated populations of children.

(For more on Dr Offit and a list of a multitude of great reference articles, click on: http://jameslyonsweiler.com/2015/11/16/paging-dr-offit-your-aluminum-neurotoxicity-reading-assignments-are-ready/)

Those of you who are also smelling a rat will agree that big multinational Agribusiness corporations that manufacture insecticides and insect repellants will profit from the story, and the vaccine, medical and veterinarian industries will profit from the first two hyped-up stories, and that Big Pharma and the psychiatric and medical industries (and their lobbyists) will benefit from the third.

The remainder of this article will deal only with the very weak Zika/microcephaly theory.

A good example of a corporation that is already profiteering from the Zika virus story is the biotech company Oxitec. Oxitec developed the technology to genetically alter male Aedes aegypti mosquitos so that no offspring would be able to reproduce. Note that there is no proof that this will do anything to contain the widespread Aedes aegypti mosquito population, but for proof of how cunning these folks are, check out the headline that I saw last week from a financial services firm. It said: “Intrexon Stock Price Spikes 20%; Oxitec Subsidiary Working To Control Zika Virus Outbreak”

That headline concerned me, but what really piqued my interest was the totally irrational microcephaly part of the mosquito story and my understanding about the serious neurotoxicity of aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines. My information comes from my extensive reading of many honorable researchers into aluminum adjuvants across the world (in Israel, Canada, France, Japan, but not many in America – or in Brazil).

False Flag Op: Blaming a Mosquito Instead of the Real Villains

The Zika virus has been around semitropical and tropical countries since 1948 with no connection to fetal anomalies for the last 70 years, so my bul…it detectors screamed loudly when the mosquito carrier of the virus was blamed as the prime suspect in causing large numbers of congenital mutations as dramatic as microcephaly. A few others besides myself smelled the strong stench of another false flag operation, and I realized that I needed do my own research.

So, partly clued in (or inspired) by the essays of Jon Rappaport (Google “Jon Rappaport and the Zika Hoax”) I started to do my independent research into this story. What I found out is disturbing, but not surprising.

Starting at the beginning, one can report that the megacorporate vaccine industry, along with many co-opted public health experts, have long been concerned about the relative lack of efficacy of the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine (the “P” in the trivalent DPT or TDaP) in actually preventing the disease even in fully vaccinated children. That reality has been effectively covered-up by the industry – with the help of the media.

In every one of the periodic outbreaks of whooping cough that we hear about from time to time (ad nauseum), large percentages, sometimes even majorities, of the sick children have been found to have been fully vaccinated with the recommended series of three shots, which should have, theoretically, protected them. In very young infants (whose immune system, blood-brain barriers and upper windpipes are at their most immature), whooping cough is much more likely to be lethal, the mortality rate varying from less than 1% to as much as 5% (in impoverished, malnourished, neglected and/or chemically poisoned populations).

Making the Mistake of Trying to “Keep up With the Joneses” in Brazil

In Brazil, public health officials have been concerned with the nation’s rising incidence of whooping cough (it was approximately double that of its neighboring countries). Between January 2007 and December 2014, there were 24,612 confirmed cases of whooping cough (averaging 3000 per year, with only small numbers of microcephalic newborns spontaneously occurring).

The actual annual incidence rates of whooping cough in Brazil between 2007 and 2010 ranged from a low of 0.32 cases per 100,000 to 0.75 per 100,000. Then, starting in 2011, there occurred increases, reaching 1.17 cases per 100,000 in 2011, 2.81 per 100,000 in 2012, 3.2 per 100,000 in 2013, and 3.25 per 100,000 in 2014 (which means that in the peak year, 2014, over 99,996 Brazilians out of every 100,000 didn’t contract whooping cough!)

During the so-called “epidemic” period [2012 – 2014], the mean annual incidence rate for whooping cough was 2.6 cases per 100,000 population, compared with 0.51 per 100,000 in the period from 2007 through 2010, but the relative rate of increase was calculated to be a pseudo-alarming 500% rise (2.6/0.51 X 100% = 520% [!])  The overall case fatality rate among confirmed cases during the eight years of the study was 2.1 % (528 deaths in the 8 years studied out of the 24,612 confirmed cases).(Statistics above were taken from a medical journal article that was titled “Increasing Incidence of Pertussis in Brazil” (BMC Infect Dis. Oct 2015). Ironically, the article was published online the month before the microcephaly outbreak occurred! (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4619034/)

Prior to the disastrous microcephaly outbreak that began in November 2015, the embarrassed Brazilian public health experts knew that Brazil’s high 90 – 95% infant vaccination rates among its infants were failing to eliminate, as promised, the occasional case of whooping cough (which, admittedly, can be fatal in very tiny infants, usually with pneumonia, encephalitis, dehydration, otitis, and malnutrition listed as contributory causes of death).

So they decided on a drastic plan: inoculate all pregnant women with the DTaP vaccine, hoping that by doing so, the babies would come out of the womb automatically immunized to whooping cough – a scientifically absurd notion.

The plan may have sounded plausible to the layperson. It may even have sounded plausible to a health science-oriented bureaucrat or perhaps even to an academic neuroscientist who might have financial conflicts of interest in not revealing what were the real villains in the outbreak. And of course, the plan looked like pure gold to Sanofi Pasteur (the largest corporation in the world devoted entirely to manufacturing and marketing vaccines) and to GlaxoSmithKline (the British mega-pharmaceutical corporation that would be getting the contract for the tens of millions of doses of aluminum-containing DTaP).

No well-designed experimental studies were done beforehand to prove that such a strategy would work, much less be safe. But I suspect that there was an uncomfortable minority of (enlightened) Brazilian strategists who were aware of the known neuroscience concerning the emerging epidemic of vaccine-induced autoimmune disorders. However, being out-numbered, I suspect that they had to resort to crossing their fingers that this high-risk plan would work out.

Crossing one’s fingers is lousy science.

Anyway, in the spring of 2015, public health officials mandated DTaP vaccinations for all pregnant Brazilian women. The vaccine contained, not just the whooping cough antigen and aluminum, but also two totally unnecessary antigens that are supposed to (allegedly) prevent diphtheria and tetanus, two illnesses that, compared to whooping cough, are so rare in first world countries as to be non-existent.

So since last year, clinics all over Brazil were injecting some form of DPT shots into pregnant women, despite the warnings from independent neuroscientists that such vaccines were known to be neurotoxic (poisonous to brain and nerve tissue), genotoxic (poisonous to DNA), mutagenic (capable of causing mutations) and generally fetotoxic (capable of poisoning fetuses, especially their brains and bones).

Conflicts of Interest (and CYA) Keep Big Lies Going, But at What Cost?

Quite often the need to preserve the reputations or wealth of powerful people or powerful industries takes precedence over the basic human needs of innocent people that may have been their victims.  So when those entities are at risk of being humiliated when their greed and  powerstious or guilty actions of the powerfulconflicts of interest are exposed, bad outcomes happen. This is true of Big Pharma, Big Medicine, Big Vaccine, Big Agribusiness, Big Chemistry, Big Food, Big Finance, Wall Street and the Pentagon.

And, after understanding the facts as revealed above, Brazilian women of child-bearing age – as are all of us – are being kept in the dark about all the facts about what Jon Rappaport calls the Zika virus hoax. The perpetrators of the hoax include officials at the WHO, the CDC, the NIH, the FDA and every major news outlet that has a paid medical doctor doing such stories. They should be ashamed of themselves for missing the essential ingredients of this story and mis-leading everybody with either their willful ignorance or their bald-faced promulgation of the Big Lie.

Rather than (irrationally) calling for a fast-tracked Zika virus vaccine against a benign mosquito virus that is the least likely to be the causative agent, these authorities have kept quiet about the really sensible thing to do until more is known: immediately stop vaccinating pregnant women with neurotoxic substances!

http://www.politifact.com/global-news/statements/2016/sep/23/daily-caller/conservative-website-wrongly-ties-clinton-foundati/,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed watered-down HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story, was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundations most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. The congressional report focused on Clintons decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company. This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nations largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company, said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty. When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDAs approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe, said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company. The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, alleged due to the companys diluted drugs, it subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality, according to the report. The question becomes, how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise, asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF. The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clintons campaign. Blackburn said she planned to deliver the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obamas first term. The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundations vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the watered-down drugs. ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered more than $1.8 million packages. Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections, Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF. Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the companys anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients. These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize, he said. Ranbaxys first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report. The FDA sent a public warning letter to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the companys quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, show much lower potencies in these batches. Although Ranbaxys generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the companys HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad. Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives. Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy. Thakur said hes now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on access to patients. The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. I have tried to reach out to them, he told TheDCNF. But I havent had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation. CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations. Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was deeply suspect. In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called CHAI was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation, Ortel told TheDCNF. The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order. He signed an executive order that, relaxed intellectual property policy standards, promising the U.S. government would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any Sub-Saharan country relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies, the report states. CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa. CHAIs endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS relief  a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush. The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clintons endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become good acquisition targets, according to the study. Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs. The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years, the report states. The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions. One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001. Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial. Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval. Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the false hopes offered by the Clinton Foundation. You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me its disturbing and very sad, she said.

It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections. But this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them. A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what shes living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby. When she came back from work, she came into her babys room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him. She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him. She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasnt breathing. She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours. The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment. She never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite. The thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing. The label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old. Sadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy. We must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness."

Cong. Duckworth voted against efforts to limit the reach and invasiveness of the IRS yesterday.  The legislation, sponsored by Cong. Peter Roskam, is designed to rein in the IRS overreach by prohibiting them from requiring the identity of most contributors to non-profit organizations.  Duckworth has been a staunch supporter of expanding the spending, size and reach of the IRS.

Roskam has sought to reform the IRS and provide greater protection to taxpayers, including measures to end unwarranted bonuses paid to IRS employees. Roskam’s current legislation would protect taxpayers from IRS reach into their religious beliefs and other forms of potential discrimination.

“My IRS bill eliminates a needless form the IRS itself says it doesn’t need,” said Cong. Roskam. “It’s disappointing but not surprising to see Tammy Duckworth once again place party loyalty above protecting her constituents from IRS abuse.”

In April, Duckworth voted against a series of measures which would enforce oversight and accountability of the IRS. These measures included tough reforms to prevent IRS from misusing taxpayer dollars, requiring the IRS to determine if current employees have serious tax delinquencies before hiring new employees, and preventing IRS employees from receiving bonuses until a comprehensive customer service strategy and system was put in place.

ROCKFORD, Illinois – During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Vin Diesel took a moment to praise Rockford, Illinois residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently:

“We were just leaving the city limits of Rockford, Illinois when the damn car overheated or something so I pulled it over to the side of the road and within just a minute or two there were a couple of cars that pulled over to help me out. I told them that I was on the phone with the rental car company but one of them had a brother who owned a tow truck and a few minutes later it was there and he towed it to a place nearby to get fixed.

So then the one guy finds out that I’m not from there and offers to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and I’m thinking, ‘Sure, what the hell.’ So we drove to the finest dining spot in Rockford – some place called GreenFire – and got a burger. Great freakin’ burger too. These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly.

I’m telling you, these people in Rockford are the real deal. I’m going to move there after I retire,” Diesel said with a laugh.

Diesel added later, “You have to understand, this is something that would’ve never happened in L.A.! So yeah, that’s my story about Rockford, Illinois. It’s nice to know there are still places like this in America.”

This administration is committed to the rule of law and to enforcing the laws established by Congress. To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this countrys lawful immigration system. They have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement  Federal, state, and local  and reduce crime, and instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents. This is astounding given the unprecedented violent crime surge in Chicago, with the number of murders in 2016 surpassing both New York and Los Angeles combined. The citys leaders cannot follow some laws and ignore others and reasonably expect this horrific situation to improve. The Mayor complains that the federal governments focus on enforcing the law would require a reordering of law enforcement practice in Chicago.

http://www.politifact.com/illinois/statements/2017/aug/28/illinois-family-institute/illinois-schools-immigrant-sanctuaries-if-only-the/,"State Politicians Turn Illinois into a Sanctuary State Most everyone has heard about sanctuary cities during the past few years due to the attention they received during the presidential election. But have you heard of sanctuary states? How about sanctuary government buildings? Governor Bruce Rauner has agreed to sign SB 31 into law  a bill that will make taxpayer funded facilities sanctuaries for people who are here illegally. Here is one summary of what sanctuary means: The concept of a sanctuary city does not mean it is a place where federal law is unenforced by the feds. Rather, it is a place where local authorities have elected not to spend their tax dollars helping the feds to enforce federal law. The term sanctuary city is not a legal term but a political one. While the United States Justice Department begins to pursue withholding federal funds from cities like Chicago for their refusal to cooperate with federal immigration law enforcement officials, our governor and General Assembly are about to enlarge the controversy, expected to cost the state billions of dollars. Thomas Lifson at American Thinker wrote about the potential tally for just Chicago alone: Oops! Trumps sanctuary city penalties could cost Chicago $3.6 billion. If the Trump Administration wins this fight (ultimately in the courts), its easy to figure the cost to Illinois taxpayers will be many times that Chicago estimate. Money isnt the only issue. The status of sanctuary state also creates a potential public safety issue. This is from the Illinois General Assemblys website page for SB 31  I have separated them into bullet points for easier reading: [CORRECTION  A reader kindly brought to my attention that the language below did NOT make it into the final version of the bill that was passed  see Amendment 3 here. In truth, the language was not necessary since state and local law enforcement officers are prohibited from making any arrests anywhere in Illinois according to the guidelines of the statute. Focusing on the state-funded facilities only made clearer the offensive nature of the law.] Provides that absent a judicial warrant or probable cause of criminal activity, a government official shall not make arrests in the following State-funded facilities or their adjacent grounds: State-funded schools, including licensed day care centers, pre-schools, and other early learning programs; elementary and secondary schools, and institutions of higher education The list continues, but you get the drift. The opinion divide on crime rates in sanctuary cities separates just as you would expect. Sanctuary proponents claim crime rates are not higher where illegal alien populations are greater, sanctuary opponents say crime rates are higher. Both sides cite studies to back up their contention. What are the facts? In an April article at The Hill, Ron Martinelli, former minority community violent crimes detective, wrote: Most states and our federal government have kept information and statistics about illegal immigration, crimes committed by illegals and the costs borne by you the U.S. payer out of public view. It is in fact difficult, but not impossible to locate accurate crime statistics involving illegal immigrants. The statistics are buried both to suit a political agenda and to avoid public outcry. His article, The truth about crime, illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities, is worth your time. It is packed with important information to consider. Another article to read is from Scott Erickson, posted at the Heritage Foundations Daily Signal website back in February: The Truth About Sanctuary Cities and Crime Rates. After a survey of the statistics, he writes: No community of decent peoplecitizens, illegal immigrants, or otherwisewants to live in a society beset by violence and social dysfunction. Stripping local law enforcement of the ability to merely cooperate with their federal counterparts on issues as plain as the removal of a dangerous criminal jeopardizes the safety of all law-abiding individuals. If state and local law enforcement will be prohibited from making any arrests anywhere in Illinois according to the statute, lets take another look at the kind of facilities that will be made into sanctuaries by Bruce Rauner signing SB 31: State-funded schools, including licensed day care centers, pre-schools, and other early learning programs; elementary and secondary schools, and institutions of higher education Is Illinois about to endanger children by preventing law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials? Again, from the SB 31 web page showing the pre-amended bill  again, revealing legislative intent: Provides that a law enforcement agency or official shall not (1) give any immigration agent access to any individual; (2) transfer any person into an immigration agents custody; (3) permit immigration agents use of agency facilities or equipment, including any agency electronic databases not available to the public, for investigative interviews or other investigative purpose in executing an immigration enforcement operation; or (4) respond to immigration agent inquiries regarding any individuals incarceration status, release date, or contact information except insofar as the agency makes that information available to the public. With Chicagos murder rate and Illinois fiscal condition, is this really the time to have our state harbor federal fugitives who have broken federal immigration law by crossing the border illegally? Harboring federal fugitives sure sounds different than the act of providing a sanctuary, doesnt it? Earlier this month, Illinois Review reported that according to the communications director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, Signing SB 31 into law would make Illinois the state most open to illegal aliens besides California: Not only would it make Illinois open to those in the country illegally, it could create dangerous situations for the public and add more financial burdens to the state, Dave Ray said. And isnt the state of Illinois already having financial difficulties? To learn more about the current and historic legal tussle between the feds and the states, read this article by Douglas V.

It is being perverted and abused by the people sworn to enforce and uphold it. Some in the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation are abusing their power to criminalize the routine practices of politics and government. I learned the hard way what happens when an investigation comes up empty after the government has invested time, resources and manpower. When they cant prove a crime, they create one. Did you know that an elected official asking for a campaign contribution is the same as a dirty cop asking a motorist for a cash bribe to tear up a speeding ticket? I never did. Yet thats what a federal prosecutor told the jury during my second trial on bribery and extortion charges in 2011. Illustration: istock/getty images Fundraising is a routine and necessary part of Americas political system. You cant compete in politics, and you cant govern from a position of strength, if you are perceived as weak. Building and maintaining a healthy war chest helps lead to success. For most people in the political arena, the fundraising part of the job is no fun. I liken it to exercise. It hurts but it makes you healthy and strong. The jury in my case was instructed to infer a quid pro quo even though no favors were offered or exchanged. The prosecutor told the jurors that if they felt Id had a belief, expectation or hope that I might receive a campaign contribution because of actions I took as governor, they had to convict me. It didnt matter that no evidence existed that explicit promises had been made. Let me be clear: I never accepted gifts, vacations, clothes, jewelry or flights on fancy jets in exchange for my political influence. Whenever I went to a Chicago Cubs game, I paid for my own tickets. Yet here I am in my sixth year of a 14-year prison sentence for the routine practice of attempting to raise campaign funds while governor. So today from prison, I am warning all candidates and elected officials to watch out. This new, lesser standard used against me to infer a quid pro quo can now be used against you, too. And the U.S. Supreme Courts failure to take up this issue means the lesser standard has been accepted as law. The justices denial last month of my appeal request is catastrophic for me, and it will in all likelihood prove calamitous to some of you. Politically motivated prosecutors can now interfere with and undo free and fair elections. As the 2018 campaign heats up, my advice to those running for elective office is to cease and desist from any further fundraising. Stop now before it is too late. Wait until the law is clarified and the line clearly drawn. Otherwise you are playing a dangerous game of chance. Overzealous and ambitious prosecutors know they can rise to higher office by coming after you. Two years ago, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell had his corruption conviction reversed by the Supreme Court in an 8-0 vote. During oral arguments, Justice Stephen Breyer warned about federal prosecutors bringing criminal charges against government officials for what he described as routine practices such as fundraising. To give that kind of power to a criminal prosecutor, who is virtually uncontrollable, is dangerous to the separation of powers, Justice Breyer said. It doesnt matter which side of the political spectrum you come from. Every officeholder who raises money is potentially at risk. Those who value freedom and love our country had better wake up.

http://www.politifact.com/missouri/statements/2017/sep/27/feministing/column-feministing-website-about-abortion-law-pant/,"A new Missouri bill would target abortion providers and sanction employment and housing discrimination against people who use birth control or have an abortion. Blessed be the fruit.


Yesterday, the Missouri House voted to pass SB 5, a bill imposing several highly burdensome and even more unnecessary restrictions on abortion providers; for example, the bill would require abortion providers to send fetal tissue samples to a pathologist within five days. While supporters of targeted restrictions of abortion providers (aka TRAP laws) claim they’re supporting women’s health, regulations like these often serve no medical purpose whatsoever. In reality, anti-choice legislators use them as a pretext to impose costs and red tape on abortion clinics, forcing them to close.

But SB 5 has another insidious purpose: to overturn a St. Louis ordinance that bans employers and landlords from discriminating against people on the basis of their reproductive health decisions. In other words, if SB 5 is passed, you could be evicted in the state of Missouri for having an abortion, using birth control, or becoming pregnant while unmarried.

This extremely common-sense city ordinance, which St. Louis passed this spring, was apparently Too Far for Missouri Governor Eric Greitens, who took to the press to complain about “radical politicians” making “St. Louis an abortion sanctuary city.” Ah, yes, the radical idea that an adult woman should be able to plan when, and whether, to have kids without risking her job or home. Greitens called state legislators back to the Capitol this summer specifically to overturn the St. Louis law, and to respond to the fact that Missouri’s last attempt to shut down abortion clinics ended up getting shut down by a federal judge.

The result of that special session is SB 5, which the Missouri Senate passed last Wednesday after 10 hours of negotiations behind closed doors. The House passed an amended, even more anti-choice version late yesterday.

That’s right. Missouri lawmakers are going out of their way to say that if an employer has a problem with you taking the pill, he can fire you – and he’ll have a seal of approval from the state of Missouri.

SB 5 puts women across Missouri at risk of losing their jobs or their homes: according to the CDC, 99% of sexually-active, reproductive-age women have used contraception. And whether or not someone is part of that 99% is none of their boss’ goddamn business. The state is outrageously, invasively giving employers and landlords the power to police highly personal choices women make about their bodies and lives. Missouri is sending the message that a woman’s livelihood, independence, even her ability to provide for her kids is all less important than her boss’ personal need to impose his narrow beliefs on her.

Missouri legislators may not have gotten the memo, but the Federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act already prohibits employment discrimination against women because they’ve had or considered an abortion. But federal protections for people who use birth control are less clear – and as the Trump Administration rolls back civil rights enforcement across the board, it’s imperative we maintain protections at the state and local levels.

As if all of this wasn’t enough, SB 5 also limits regulation of so-called “Crisis Pregnancy Centers” (anti-choice “clinics” that feed pregnant people misinformation to trick them out of having abortions), gives Missouri’s virulently anti-choice Attorney General Josh Hawley power to prosecute potential violations of Missouri’s TRAP laws, and allow the state to harass abortion clinics with unannounced inspections. The House’s version of the bill is headed back to the Senate, with amendments making it even harsher – and if it passes there it’ll head straight to Governor Greitens’ desk.

Are you in Missouri? Find your state representatives and call them to say you oppose SB 5, restrictions on reproductive freedom, and discrimination based on reproductive health decisions.

http://www.politifact.com/nevada/statements/2016/apr/07/blog-posting/no-bernie-sanders-didnt-retroactively-win-nevada/,"Weeks after Democratic voters in Nevada held their presidential caucus, the result changed in the favor of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders during the party's convention Saturday - and now appears poised to win the state.
Even though his opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was declared the winner after the February 20 election, the convention this weekend determined which delegates go to another convention in May - and Sanders hit the jackpot by taking away Vegas from Clinton's win column.

The county convention was rife with controversy, from rumors that Sanders delegates were threatened with arrest if they showed up, allegations that the county party was sharing information with the Clinton campaign, and attempts by her supporters to get an official fired for sharing information with the Sanders campaign.

“We caught the Hillary campaign cheating, we caught the Nevada Democratic Party secretary cheating,” credentials committee member Angie Sullivan said. “When it was apparent Bernie started winning, they really turned up the heat.”

The Credentials Committee for the Clark County convention decides who qualifies as a delegate. It is made up of four members and two representatives for Clinton and Sanders.

The delegate win is seen as a further bolstering of the Sanders campaign, which has won six out of the last seven primaries: Utah, Idaho, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, and Democrats abroad.

The next primary is Tuesday in Wisconsin, a state known for its maverick progressive credentials dating back to the days of “Fighting” Bob LaFollette.

Catherine Cortez Masto addressed the Nevada Raising Wages summit today, a Las Vegas conference hosted by union leaders. Cortez Masto pitched higher pay for Nevada workers but predictably failed to address her own shameless hypocrisy.

During Cortez Masto’s tenure in statewide office, Nevada state workers experienced a pay freeze as the state faced ongoing financial challenges. In addition to frozen salaries, workers dealt with furloughs that further cut into their take home pay. At the same time, then-Attorney General Cortez Masto accepted a taxpayer-funded six percent pay raise, increasing her salary from $133,000 to $141,086 annually – even as other Nevada elected officials declined the salary hike.

In 2011, Masto was 1 of 2 statewide officials who accepted a 6% pay raise that increased her salary from $133,000 to $141,086. [Splitting from Gov. Sandoval, Controller Wallin and] Masto are going to keep the 6% pay raise they will receive this month. Sandoval last week told a news conference he wouldn’t accept the raise and encouraged other constitutional officers to do the same thing…Under state law, the constitutional officers are entitled to an increase in salary of 6% this month, but Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki said this isn’t the time to take a pay increase. Krolicki and Secretary of State Ross Miller won’t take the 6% raise. State Treasurer Kate Marshall also won’t take the pay increase, but she said she won’t continue voluntarily giving up the 4.6% reduction. . . . [Masto] will accept her new salary of $141,086, up from $133,000. (Las Vegas Sun, January 6, 2011)

Masto accepted a 6% pay raise while rank-and-file state employees coped with a pay freeze and furloughs. “Today, Nevada constitutional officers and legislators receive a 6% pay raise while state employees are still under a pay freeze…State workers received 2% raises in 2007 and 4% in 2008. However, those increases were diminished because of furloughs in 2009 and 2010 and those furloughs probably won’t end with the New Year.” (Elko Daily Free Press, Editorial, December 31, 2010)

When it comes to higher pay, Cortez Masto leads by example – in all the wrong ways. The political insider was happy to line her own pockets with taxpayer dollars when state employees were slammed with frozen salaries. Harry Reid’s handpicked Senate candidate couldn’t be any less interested in fighting for Nevada families. She’s too busy helping herself."

http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2014/jun/18/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-jeanne-shaheen-voted-new-national/,"MANCHESTER – Yesterday, United States Senator Jeanne Shaheen’s office denied that she had voted for a national energy tax and demanded proof. The challenge came in the form of a tweet from Judy Reardon, Shaheen’s chief legal counsel.

In response to the challenge, the Brown campaign cited the following vote from March, 2013 on Senator Sheldon Whitehouse’s amendment to establish a new tax on carbon:

(S. Amdt. 646 To S. Con. Res. 8, Roll Call Vote #58: Rejected 41-58, 3/22/13, Shaheen Voted Yea)

As Senator Whitehouse said clearly at the time, “This amendment that will allow us to put a price on carbon.”

Said Colin Reed, Scott Brown’s campaign manager: “It’s deeply troubling that Senator Shaheen and her staff are so out-of-touch that they are no longer even aware of the bad votes she’s taking. The simple fact is that one year ago, Senator Shaheen voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax which would have a disastrous impact on New Hampshire’s economy. It’s very concerning her office doesn’t seem to know about it. This is what happens when you vote 99 percent of the time with President Obama: you’re more robot than representative.”

According to the non-partisan National Association of Manufacturers, Senator Shaheen’s support for a national energy tax would eliminate 10,000 New Hampshire jobs, increase the price of electricity and natural gas, and force prices at the pump to go up as much as another 20 cents per gallon"
http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2016/apr/26/shawn-oconnor/nh-democrat-says-popular-political-stop-infested-r/,"BEDFORD, N.H. – “I was dismayed by the spurious and completely false allegations made against me by Attorney Bob Christie of Shaheen & Gordon in a statement released today by the New Hampshire Democratic Party.

Neither my attorneys nor I have had any contact with the New Hampshire Democratic Party since April 5th. The timing of this release is, thus, suspect to say the least.

On February 19, 2016, I contacted NHDP Chairman Buckley with a list of 10 detailed, demonstrably false allegations that had been disseminated by NHDP staffers and members of Carol Shea-Porter’s campaign team and asked Chairman Buckley to help end the dissemination of these untruthful statements, which included the inexcusable lie, widely disseminated by the Shea-Porter campaign, that I am a perpetrator of domestic violence. It has now been clearly proven beyond any doubt that I am a survivor of domestic violence. Chairman Buckley refused to address any of these false allegations or mediate our resulting dispute with the Shea-Porter campaign.

On March 2, 2016, my attorney sent a detailed, 8-page letter to Chairman Buckley, the New Hampshire Democratic Party, Carol Shea-Porter and the Shea-Porter campaign outlining, again, in great detail the numerous false allegations being spread by NHDP staffers and the Shea-Porter campaign. This letter again detailed how the Shea-Porter campaign was spreading the lie that I am perpetrator of domestic violence. In addition, this letter, for example, documented how State Senator Donna Soucy (D-Manchester) made a ridiculous allegation to State Senator David Pierce (D-Lebanon), after he endorsed me. Senator Soucy told Senator Pierce that I had planned to purchase and place rats in the kitchen of the Puritan Backroom, a restaurant owned by Executive Councilor Chris Pappas (D-Manchester), a close associate of Chairman Buckley, and his family. I do not know where one would purchase rats nor do I know where the kitchen is in the Puritan Backroom. Furthermore, a simple review of the Backroom’s health code records will reveal that the restaurant already has a long-standing problem with rodent infestations.

I subsequently asked NHDP Vice Chair and State Senator Martha Fuller Clark, Gubernatorial Candidate Mark Connelly, among others, to stop this character assassination and mediate this dispute. They also refused. Only State Senator Jeff Woodburn would meet with my staff and me about this distressing situation to try and work towards a constructive solution. New Hampshire AFL-CIO President called to express his grave concerns about this situation and Chairman Buckley falsely indicated that he knew nothing about this character assassination or a potential lawsuit stemming from it.

At no point have my attorneys or I, in any way, suggested that I be paid to leave this congressional race. Furthermore, as Ms. Shea-Porter’s campaign has constantly pointed out, I was very fortunate to be successful in business so the notion that I would engage in illegal activity for what, I can only suspect, would be a relatively small amount of money is ridiculous. Indeed, the only person who has ever suggested such a ludicrous idea was Mr. Christie in one of his last communications with my attorney, Mr. Clare. Mr. Christie also implied that the party would use its influence to have me arrested on spurious charges if I continued to assert my legal rights.

We consider Mr. Christie’s accusations on behalf of the NHDP today defamation per se and will pursue our legal rights against the party. We have substantial correspondence and documentation supporting this and all the other statements made in this release which we will make public at the appropriate time.

Finally, we have long contested that the NHDP has been violating Section E(1), specifically Subsections E(1)(j) and E(1)(h) of the state party’s constitution (on which I relied in entering the party’s primary). These sections of the party constitution require that the NHDP remain neutral in party primaries. Today’s completely unprovoked attack on me serves as further proof that the party is supporting Ms. Shea-Porter and violating its own constitution. This is both undemocratic and un-Democratic.”

http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2016/feb/19/new-hampshire-democratic-party/new-hampshire-democratic-party-says-one-year-vacan/,"Concord, N.H. – Fearing discontent from her far-right base and pressure to appease her party bosses, Senator Kelly Ayotte has rejected her constitutional duty and decided to back Mitch McConnell’s controversial decision to block the Senate from giving fair and timely consideration to President Obama’s next Supreme Court nominee—a move that would leave the nation’s highest court with an unprecedented year-long vacancy.

And while Ayotte may have made this decision to try to save her political career, her move only serves to reinforce to New Hampshire voters that Washington is broken — and Ayotte is part of the problem.

Ayotte’s dereliction of duty is a politically calculated move to appease her party’s leadership and far-right base:

Southern New Hampshire University Professor Dean Spiliotes told WMUR prior to Ayotte’s announcement that, “if she seems to waver at all on this issue of whether to give Obama’s nominee a hearing and a vote, she could end up with a primary challenge from the right.”

CNN’s Hugh Hewitt put it simply when he said, “The base will not forgive anyone. Senators will lose their jobs if they block the blockade. There should be an absolute blockade on this.”

But Ayotte’s strategy is sure to backfire:

The Washington Post reported on how her decision “could also undermine efforts by Senate Republicans to show that they are capable of governing and not just ‘the party of no.’ Make no mistake: The upper chamber will grind to a standstill if the GOP follows through on this threat.”

According to the New York Times, “The death of Justice Antonin Scalia has energized a right flank that has been long suspicious of Mr. McConnell and forced him into a fight that is likely to derail his smooth-functioning Senate. The tactic could alienate moderate voters and imperil incumbent Republicans in swing states.”

Roll Call noted that “winning over middle-of-the-road voters who prefer temperamentally and ideologically moderate candidates is essential to victory — and those are exactly the type of voters Democrats hope a contentious fight over the Supreme Court vacancy will alienate most.”

And New Hampshire political analyst Scott Spralding told NECN that “It is the end run of our entire system here in America and I am not sure people like to tinker around with the politics of the United State Supreme Court. There could be significant blowback for anyone seen as trying to stop this entire process.”

Bottom line:

“Kelly Ayotte’s actions this week make it more than clear that she values appeasing her party bosses and right wing activists over the people of New Hampshire and will seal her fate when it comes to her reelection in November,” said New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Raymond Buckley. “Her obstruction and unwillingness to do her constitutional duty will go over like a lead balloon with New Hampshire’s famously pragmatic general electorate.”

http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/will-federal-government-require-devices-slow-down-/,"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States. Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board. Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds. When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit. According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant. Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation. According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer. Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website."
http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2017/apr/17/jeb-bush/does-school-competition-lift-all-boats-jeb-bush-sa/,"For the Monitor Since our nation was founded, the Live Free or Die state has stood out for its embrace of individual liberty. This makes pending legislation that would set up Education Freedom Savings Accounts a natural fit for New Hampshire families. The first two words here are key: Education Freedom. The current, outdated model of public education is based on funding government bureaucracies that in turn make decisions best left to families, such as decisions on where kids will go to school and what classes they can take. The proposed accounts would instead fund students directly and let parents make those decisions. If for whatever reason a public school isnt working for their child, they can find a better fit in another school. They also can access the funds for online classes, tutors and supplies. Or if they are the parents of a student with disabilities, they can use the funds for approved therapies critical to their childs development. These accounts are an acknowledgement that parents, not government institutions, are the best decision makers for children. They love them the most, know them the best and are the ones most vested in their future success. And therefore, they should be given the freedom and resources to pursue the right education options for them. This legislation is not an attack on public schools. It simply is an acknowledgment that kids are unique individuals and one size does not fit all. Nor will this legislation hurt public schools. In fact, a large body of research, including that done in my home state of Florida, indicates quite the opposite. When public schools face increased competition, they get better and kids learn more. Education Freedom Savings Accounts not only would benefit the children whose parents take advantage of them, but also the children who remain in their traditional public schools. The approach was first introduced in Arizona in 2011, focused on the parents of students with disabilities. In subsequent years, the program was expanded to include students zoned in low-performing schools, the students of military personnel and students living on Native American lands. Based on their success, Arizona lawmakers are now considering making them available to every student. Other states have taken notice. Mississippi, Tennessee, Florida and Nevada all have approved versions of the program, each with its own eligibility requirements. In 2015, Nevada became the first state to make the accounts available to all parents. I encourage New Hampshire to follow suit. Empowering parents with the freedom to choose encourages positive change because the right to educate their children no longer can be taken for granted. It must be earned. I commend state Sen. John Reagan, state Reps. Joseph Pitre and Glenn Cordelli for introducing this legislation, and Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been a passionate advocate for school choice. The issue boils down to this: Do we trust mom and dad, or not?

Specifically, these problems include long wait times and customers being turned away due to computer problems. The public hearing proved itself to be nothing more than naked political theater by the Democratic members of the committee and a brazen election year stunt. The problems with MVC service are almost entirely caused by an outdated computer system that is 30 years old. The technology was placed in service back when drivers licenses were little more than laminated pieces of paper, not the secure documents that we rely on today to prevent identity theft, crime and terrorism. Since the beginning of the Christie administration, the MVC has made great strides in serving its customers. It has placed a greater emphasis on moving critical technology projects forward to better position the commission for the future. We have finally restarted much-needed upgrades that were put on hold during the Codey and Corzine administrations. Year after year, during budget hearings, those of us who serve on the budget committees were told about major MVC technology investments, such as the Motor Vehicle Automated Transaction System (MATRX) and the Enhanced Digital Driver License (EDDL), which were planned to improve customer service and make the MVC computers more reliable. The proposed introduction of an extended six-year license, along with plans to implement online license renewals, were meant to be positive changes for New Jersey drivers. Those changes would make renewing easier and would reduce customer volume spikes and long lines at MVC offices. In reality, projections about the effects of a six-year license were off, implementation of the new digital driver license was greatly delayed and customer volume spikes and long lines exist to this day. Had the EDDL project moved forward within the planned time frame under previous administrations, a contract would have been awarded in August 2008. Under this timeline, online renewals would have been in place by late 2009, and the delays caused by the outdated, unreliable technology would not continue to occur. While previous governors never made improving customer service at the MVC a priority, the Christie administration has been proactive in addressing short-term MVC needs while it works to complete its long-term technological improvements. MVC office hours have been increased 20 percent to 54.5 hours per week  more hours than ever before  and include the restoration of service on Mondays. Additional staff is being added at high-volume MVC offices to speed up transactions, and additional cameras that are needed to issue drivers licenses are being installed, as well. And to ensure that customers are not left waiting in line exposed to the elements, MVC office space is being rearranged to shelter more customers comfortably indoors while they are waiting to be served. These changes will yield near immediate results in improving the customer experience at MVC offices and are the best short-term options available to remedy a bad situation left by previous governors and Motor Vehicle commissioners. But they are just that: short-term solutions. The key to modernizing the MVC and solving its problems in the long term lies in updated technology. Gov. Christie is fixing the problems left by other governors who failed to bring the MVCs computer technology up to modern standards. The dramatic change at the MVC is not just about this administrations push to introduce new technology, but also a number of other positive steps designed to better serve its customers. From instituting the greatest number of agency service hours in motor vehicle history and the opening of state-of-the-art facilities on state-owned land to installing more camera equipment and increasing staffing levels at our states busiest agencies, under Gov. Christies leadership, the MVC is doing whats necessary to fulfill the needs of New Jersey drivers. After all of the upgrades are completed and more services are online, the wait times at the MVC will drop significantly. In fact, most drivers will have to visit the MVC only once every eight years  a welcome change from the current situation. I would have hoped that my colleagues in the Legislature who noted concerns about the MVC would have shown greater interest over the last several years when essential technology projects were languishing under previous administrations. Updating the technological capabilities of the MVC is of critical importance and should not be used for political gain. As we near the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we should not forget that some of the hijackers used New Jersey drivers licenses to board those aircraft. Efforts like these to make the state drivers license more secure and the MVC more efficient will go a long way toward making drivers happier and New Jersey safer.

It is no coincidence that during this same period it was the first time in recorded history where the state had less private sector jobs at the end of the decade than we had at the beginning. Now today, Democrats continue to push for an increase in the income tax and for another state budget that relies on gimmicks and phantom revenue projections. This budget is an astounding $1.2 billion more than the budget proposed by the Governor in February and is based on nearly $600 million in dubious revenue including $190 million in mysterious efficiencies that are assumed will take place, but have not been identified, and $365 million in an income tax windfall that has not been certified. This is on top of a $165 million shortfall due to the loss of health benefits savings as a result of the compromise of the newly enacted pension and healthcare reform legislation. Democrats knew this money would not be available following testimony two weeks ago from the Treasurers office, yet they chose to include it in their budget anyway. It is really easy to promise things people want when you are paying for it with money you do not have. In the long-term, this unrealistic budget will make New Jersey less competitive, stifle private-sector job growth, entrepreneurship and chase businesses and their jobs to neighboring states. The only way to restore New Jerseys once proud record of job creation is to fix the errors of the past and to lower the cost of total government, and reform our tax and regulatory environments. The Governor put forth a responsible budget proposal in February that reflects the realities of our time and the serious economic problems we still face. Unfortunately this budget does not resemble that proposal and the disciplined fiscal policies we need to once again become the economic engine that creates jobs for our residents."

State Senator Diane Allen (R- Burlington/Camden) has signed on as a cosponsor to S-2250, legislation repealing New Jersey’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). At a news conference announcing her support for the legislation, Senator Allen stressed the negative impact RGGI has on job creation, energy affordability, and taxes.

“New Jersey residents cannot afford this initiative- both in terms of the adverse impact it has on job creation as well as the cost to consumers,” said Allen. “RGGI is effectively a tax placed on a service essential to families and businesses, at a time when our economy can least tolerate it. For the sake of the 9.3% of New Jersey workers who are unemployed and the countless families who are struggling mightily to get by in this recession, we need to repeal the law.”

Senator Allen said she is particularly concerned about small businesses that are most vulnerable to increases in overhead costs. “As a former president and CEO of a small business, I can attest to the impact rising energy rates have on an employer’s ability to add jobs and expand,” she said. “Just ask Ocean Spray, which last week announced it will be moving its Bordentown processing facility to Pennsylvania, in large measure due to the costs associated with RGGI.”

Senator Allen was joined by Senator Michael J. Doherty (R- Warren/Hunterdon), prime sponsor of the repeal legislation, and Steve Lonegan, state director of Americans for Prosperity. Senator Doherty’s legislation enjoys bipartisan support from 44 legislative sponsors and co-sponsors.

“The cost of living in New Jersey is too high already,” Allen stated. “State government should be working to make our state more affordable, not less.”"

I read alot about Ms. Pattersons background. I certainly did not like her client list. And I didnt like the facts that led to her nomination. I also felt the lack of racial and ethnic diversity on the court was another very unhealthy result of her nomination by the Governor. The first negative (the client list) did not present (in my opinion) a constitutionally sound reason to cast a No vote. The second two negatives were not anything which I could lay at her feet. Ms. Patterson has an excellent educational and experience background for service on the high court. She handled the long hearing in a professional manner with a calm demeanor. She displayed the judicial temperament often discussed when approving a potential judge. She was excellent in her responses and very deft in her non responses. When I did cast my yes vote, I articulated my feeling about the lack of diversity on the court. When the Governor gets his next appointment, I hope he is particularly sensitive to that concern. Although I guess sensitive, is not how we can describe this Governor! So there you have it! You might agree or disagree, but I did what I thought was the right thing in this situation. Lets hope that Ms. Patterson will not be a disappointment to us. Other subjects from the past week include Coptergate: theres not too much more to say about that subject. Of course, it gave Mr. Christie another opportunity to use another insulting word about another woman legislator. But you already know how I feel about that. Today the Senate Health & Human Services Committee will hold a roundtable on the administrations medicaid waiver proposal. It is horrifying they are proposing that a mom and two children who earn more than $103 per week would no longer be eligible for medicaid! These folks would then be in the ranks of the uninsured. Cruel and stupid. Ill also be participating in a press conference with some other legislators and NJN folks on what is shaping up to be a give-away of one of our states greatest assets. NJN is the only news station which covers New Jersey government. Their public affairs and interview shows as well as the nightly news will be no longer.We still dont have the detail on this, and once the state report is officially released, the Legislature will have 15 days to respond or the give-away is considered approved. The licenses and other assets are being given for no charge, and now it seems that the State will be gifting $4 million as an added goody to WNET. What is wrong with this deal? Lets hear some cheering for keeping NJN as a real New Jersey station! Keep your voices heard!"
http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/27/tom-kean-jr/state-sen-tom-kean-jr-says-new-jerseys-taxes-cause/,"Decision Fails Children and Taxpayers Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean, Jr. (R- Union) issued the following statement in response to the New Jersey Supreme Courts ruling ordering the state to spend $500 million on the 31 former Abbott school districts: The unelected justices of the New Jersey Supreme Court issued a ruling today that created law from the bench despite having no constitutional authority to do so. In so doing, they have thumbed their noses at the residents of the state who elected a Governor and a Legislature to make these policy decisions as is prescribed by the state constitution. The Court is wrong. A thorough and efficient system of education is not solely contingent on dollars, but requires significant reforms to make those dollars work better for students: rewarding excellent teachers for merit rather than longevity, reforming tenure to more easily and quickly remove ineffective educators from the classroom, and capping superintendent salaries to rein in administrative costs. Quality education is about holding the system accountable for student outcomes, and we should not turn to spending as a remedy until accountability measures are put in place. The Courts ruling fails disadvantaged students by continuing a decades-old legal theory that, since its inception, has not measurably improved the poor graduation rates and test scores of chronically failing school districts. Republicans have been clear: we will not raise taxes on the most highly taxed people in America to pay for another wrongheaded decision by the Supreme Court. The states tax burden has, according to census figures released today, cost our state another 190,000 residents in 2009. The Legislative Majority needs to put its cards on the table and come forward with ideas on how to address this ruling."
http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/08/amy-handlin/affordable-care-act-withholds-federal-matching-fun/,"Reggie Jackson once compared his fellow Hall of Famer Nolan Ryans fastball to ice cream. Every hitter likes fastballs just like everybody likes ice cream. But you dont like it when someones stuffing it into you by the gallon, is how Jackson described the fastball that struck out more hitters than any other in baseball history. Health care is obviously more important than ice cream. The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, was stuffed into law two years ago and has been serving up tax increases by the gallon and overwhelming taxpayers and jobs-creating businesses. Affordable health care is now even further out of reach. Instead of encouraging states to improve health care at reduced costs for taxpayers, the Obama administration has decided to force states to enroll more patients in Medicaid without concern for costs. In New Jersey, these mandates entailed a 40 percent increase of enrollees at an estimated cost of more than $900 million from 2014 to 2020, when all of the acts increases are implemented. The federal government is supposed to match what states spend on new enrollees. I have serious concerns about Washingtons ability to keep a promise, especially because it has already indicated New Jerseys new enrollees arent entitled to federal funds. As usual, New Jersey was a leader on this issue and expanded coverage for needy families. With reform that could save taxpayers $300 million, the state was able to increase coverage without placing the burden on taxpayers or cutting services. What was our reward for doing the right thing? These new enrollees wont qualify for the matching federal funds simply because we added them onto the rolls before 2014. According to the Obama administration, doing whats right only counts when its done on its schedule. In New Jersey, we strive to provide better health care with less cost. President Obamas plan does the reverse and cuts $3,700 worth of benefits for certain senior citizens, according to the Heritage Foundation, which estimated that lower-income earners and minorities would be hit hardest.Thats as responsible as sending up a hitter to face a 100 mph fastball without a helmet.Obamacare also places new taxes on health devices such as hearing aids, imaging machines, replacement hips and even the common tongue depressor. These costs will be passed on to consumers and have a chilling effect on the industrys research and development budgets, meaning less innovation in this very important field. The billions of dollars worth of taxes added to insurers, prescriptions and medical devices will mean higher prices and fewer choices for patients. Some taxes will come right out of their pockets. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires every American to buy government-approved health insurance or face fines of up to $695 or 2.5 percent of his or her income. For younger senior citizens between retirement and Medicaid eligibility, this could mean a $1,400 penalty for a couple earning less than $56,000. Happy retirement! Similarly, disastrous fines are applied to employers, who will face fines up to a $3,000 penalty for every employee who doesnt receive sufficient coverage. Already, its estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that more than 3 million people annually will lose their health coverage through their employer because of the health acts mandates. With the ever-increasing costs of health care, its not hard to conceive employers doing cost/benefit analysis between paying a fine of $2,000-$3,000 and a $10,000 health plan. That same office has already debunked President Obamas claim that his reform will cost around $900 billion over 10 years. In reality, the plan will cost taxpayers $1.762 trillion over the next decade. That was about as big of a swing and a miss as you can get. The Supreme Court last week listened to arguments about whether the plan is legal. Although it would be prudent to wait for its ruling, some of my colleagues have rushed to the plate with a bureaucratic plan to implement Obamacare in New Jersey with even more taxes, fees and assessments on health insurers. Our best approach at the state and federal level would be to take a step back and find ways to deliver better health care at less cost to patients and taxpayers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act implements a massive and expensive bureaucracy. It changes the system and preserves inefficient health care. We need to reduce health-care costs by encouraging free competition and innovation, listening to doctors who know how to eliminate needless expenses in health care and aggressively manage chronic conditions to prevent expensive treatments. These types of approaches will truly reform the care people receive and what it costs them. President Obama has struck out in his attempt to reform health care. Senior citizens and families struggling to afford health care are no better off than they were two years ago. Theyre down to their final strike, and President Obama is not going to ease up on them.

http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/07/anthony-bucco/state-sen-anthony-bucco-claims-democrat-led-legisl/,"Following testimony from Labor Commissioner Harold Wirths before the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, Senators Anthony Bucco, Kevin OToole, Steven Oroho, Joe Pennacchio, and Jennifer Beck remarked that the labor indicators presented to the committee show a marked turnaround for the states long term economic health. Senator Anthony Bucco (R-Morris), Republican Budget Officer: The Administration is to be applauded for putting the states unemployment insurance fund on the path to solvency more quickly than anyone expected. Through a combination of tax reforms, efficiencies, and aggressive prosecution of fraud and abuse, this Governor has fixed the mess he inherited as a result of years of diversions and fiscal irresponsibility by an unchecked Democratic Majority in Trenton. Senator Kevin OToole (R-Essex): The bankrupt unemployment insurance fund inherited by Governor Christie is emblematic of the problems created by years of budget gimmicks, revenue grabs, and borrowing. The fact that this fund will be stabilized by the end of 2013 is a testament to this Administrations leadership in restoring fiscal sanity to our state and sending a signal to job creators that they will not be gouged to pay for irresponsibility in Trenton. Senator Steven Oroho (R-Sussex): Private sector job creation is a key indicator of our states economic health. In the past two years, we have cut taxes, taken actions to help lower the cost of government and created 60,000 private sector jobs. This is compared to many years of tax and spending increases that helped contribute to the loss of nearly 250,000 private sector jobs. That is a contrast that speaks for itself. We have much more work to do, but a New Jersey with a competitive tax structure and fiscally disciplined government is a great recipe for private sector job creation. Senator Joe Pennacchio (R-Morris): Simply put, the difficult decisions weve made over the last two years are getting results for our economy: restoring solvency to the UI fund, putting more private sector jobs into our economy, and improving the outlook for job seekers across the state. This was accomplished this not through sound-bites or gimmicky legislation, rather, it was achieved by restoring honesty, integrity, and affordability to the state budget. Senator Jennifer Beck (R-Monmouth): While we will not be content until every New Jersey worker who needs a job can find a job, we are clearly moving in the right direction with regard to our economy. New Jersey is slowly coming back from a decade of economic stagnation and decline precipitated by poor decision making in Trenton. For the first time in recent memory, a majority of New Jersey residents believe our state is on the right track. It isnt hard to see why: were doing something different and it is working for our economy."

When a highly-respected, veteran budget expert for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services questioned those numbers, Christie did what he always does: He went on YouTube and attacked Legislative Budget and Finance Officer David Rosen as the Dr. Kevorkian of the numbers. Meanwhile, state tax collections came in below Christies rosy-colored predictions in March, April, May and July. We know the June numbers were down anywhere from $250 million to $540 million. But we cant be sure how much because Christie is violating his own executive order on fiscal transparency by refusing to release the June numbers. So far, unfortunately, its Dr. Kevorkian and not Gov. YouTube who has been right about the revenues. Being honest about the numbers would undermine the Endless Summer tour that Christie has embarked on to demand that New Jerseys Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest  regardless of whether the state can afford it. You wont hear about any of this Tuesday night, when Christie joyously proclaims that his policies should serve as a model for the Mitt Romney-Paul Ryan ticket  and the nation. But an interesting thing happened on the way to Tampa  Christie admitted there wont be any mention of the Jersey Comeback in his keynote. Perhaps hes finally reached a moment of enlightenment?

Following two requests, Higgins, a member of the Train Station Selection Committee, received a more detailed breakdown of the cost estimates for the different train station options. After a review of that data, Higgins is sending a detailed memo to fellow committee members outlining why Buffalos Central Terminal is not only the best choice for Buffalo but the most cost-effective. Higgins writes, To succeed, Buffalo needs to build on its strengths, including its tremendous architectural heritage, and needs to make sure that no neighborhood is left behind in its resurgence. This is a decision that requires vision  a vision for what Buffalo was and what Buffalo can be. Assemblyman Sean Ryan said ""I thank Congressman Higgins for carefully studying the cost breakdown, and revealing an accurate analysis. I and many others have been skeptical of the numbers put out by the consultants, and now our suspicions have been confirmed. The fact that the consultants did not factor in historic tax credits is puzzling. Additonally, the consultants have not factored in the significant amount of money that has been spent on consulting fees which have created a planning blueprint for Canalside. The master plan for Canalside does not involve a train station. Locating a train station at Canalside and throwing away these planning documents would be a waste of time and resources. Bringing the Central Terminal back to life will help to spark investment on Buffalo's East Side. A renovated Central Terminal will be a catalyst for economic growth, just as the Richardson Olmsted Complex has been for Buffalo's West Side. Looking at all the facts, we can see that the Central Terminal is the best choice for a new train station in the City of Buffalo."" For a fair comparison Congressman Higgins analysis looks only at the cost for full-capacity train station build-outs at each location. It also factors in state and federal Historic Tax Credits available only to the Central Terminal.

http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2017/aug/11/chris-collins/how-has-gun-crime-changed-safe-act/,"By Chris Collins Last Friday, I introduced the Second Amendment Guarantee Act (SAGA), legislation that would protect the Second Amendment rights of all Americans by preventing states from exceeding existing federal regulations on rifles and shotguns. This law would prohibit states from regulating, prohibiting, registering or licensing a rifle or shotgun for the sale, manufacturing, importation, transfer, possession or marketing beyond the requirements of federal law. If enacted by Congress and signed by the president, SAGA would repeal much of Gov. Andrew Cuomos Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act and stop his ability to infringe upon the rights of law-abiding New Yorkers by instituting strict rifle and shotgun regulations. While I understand the importance of the 10th Amendment of our Constitution, which provides states the responsibility to initiate laws and regulations, states like New York should not have the ability to take away the constitutional rights of their citizens. The Constitution grants American citizens the right to bear arms in the Second Amendment. This amendment shall not be infringed upon and unfortunately, that is what Cuomos SAFE Act does. Lets face it. The SAFE Act was a bad idea from the start. The legislation was drafted in closed-door meetings. The text was not available until 20 minutes before the State Senate was scheduled to vote on the measure. And Cuomo bypassed any debate of the legislation in both the Assembly and the State Senate. That is a pretty cavalier attitude when it comes to taking away a constitutional right. The SAFE Act also creates an incredible amount of confusion. The Cuomo bill originally prohibited the sale of magazines that hold more than seven rounds. The problem, of course, was that seven-round magazines do not exist for most popular firearms. This provision of the bill was amended shortly after passage to allow for the sale of 10-round magazines, but now only seven rounds can be stored at any one time. Adding to the confusion is that many of the SAFE Acts outlawed long guns are safely used by sportsmen and women throughout the nation. Despite promises that curbing the Second Amendment rights of Americans will reduce violent crime, the SAFE Act has had no meaningful impact on crime or gun violence. Statistics show that violent crimes where a firearm is used have remained static since 2013 in both New York State and Erie County. The Founding Fathers envisioned a society where Americans have, and will forever possess, the right to keep and bear arms. The Second Amendment can only be interpreted one way, and that is it guarantees that Americans have the right to own a firearm. It is one of my most important duties, as a member of Congress, to assure that the rights granted to the people in my district are not infringed upon. Upon passage, my SAGA legislation will stop the infringement of our Second Amendment rights by Cuomo and the state of New York. Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, represents New Yorks 27th District in the House of Representatives."
http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2017/jun/02/anthony-brindisi/state-money-was-not-used-buy-beer-tanks-genesee-br/,"Utica – The three Assemblymembers representing Herkimer County – Anthony Brindisi of Utica, Brian Miller of New Hartford, and Marc Butler of Newport say the news that a dozen beer fermentation tanks currently being transported down the Erie Canal to the Genesee Brewing Company in Rochester were made in China with nearly $10 million in State Economic Development dollars when upstate companies like Feldmeier Manufacturing Inc. in Little Falls could have done the work is deeply troubling.


“The fermentation tanks going down the Erie Canal are literally on a slow boat from China. It disgusts me to know that state economic development dollars were used to support a project where goods were manufactured in China, when we have companies like Feldmeier Equipment that produce products like this right in the Mohawk Valley. New York should put its money where its mouth is and support our state workers and state companies first, before they ship taxpayer’s money right out the door to China,” Brindisi said.

“It simply makes no sense to export economic development dollars to China, when by definition this funding is supposed to grow jobs here in New York. New York has many long-time manufacturers like Feldmeier that are more than willing to produce quality products, and these companies deserve a chance to do business with the state,” Miller said.

“As we struggle to improve the economy of upstate New York, I think this administration has missed a tremendous opportunity to secure employment opportunities here in Little Falls and the Mohawk Valley. I’m truly disappointed that a highly regarded company like Feldmeier has been by-passed by this process, and in particular when state funding is a part of the project. We must take steps to insure that does not happen again in the Mohawk Valley or anywhere in New York State,” Butler said.

“It is extraordinarily disappointing in light of all of the efforts my partners in government and I are putting toward keeping jobs local and invigorating the upstate economy that more effort did not go into ensuring these incentives went to Feldmeier, a company that has been in Little Falls for more than six decades,” said Little Falls Mayor Mark Blask.

Brindisi says the Buy New York Act (A.5510) he is sponsoring, which is supported by Miller and Butler, would require state agencies to give preference to buying goods and services produced in New York State when handing out tax dollars, as well as requiring the use of New York State iron, steel, and manufactured products for many government contracts.

Enclosed is the text of the letter the three Assembly members have written on the issue to Governor Andrew Cuomo and Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Howard Zemsky:

Dear Governor Cuomo and Commissioner Zemsky:


While it has been exciting to see the interest generated in the Erie Canal over the recent shipment of beverage tanks to the North American Brewery Facility in Rochester, the event has generated some strong concerns for us here in Herkimer County and the Mohawk Valley.


As you know, the tanks were manufactured in China and then shipped here for delivery. We believe you can understand that the fanfare for this event was less than enthusiastic in the City of Little Falls, where Feldmeier Equipment, Inc., has a production facility that specializes in tanks of this nature. While there have been statements that Feldmeier did not submit a bid for the project, we are led to believe the opposite is true. In fact, we are absolutely convinced that Feldmeier submitted a proposal for the project and had asked for your support.


Gentlemen, this was a $50 million project which included approximately $9.5 million in state assistance ($4.5 million in performance based Excelsior Jobs Program Tax credits and up to $5 million in Upstate Revitalization Initiative)– assistance provided by the taxpayers of New York State, Herkimer County and the residents of the City of Little Falls. We feel we must express our surprise and disappointment that there were no conditions placed on the expenditure of this state funding.


This project had the potential to be a great win for New York with the attention it drew to the canal, the development of additional brewing capacity for the Rochester area, and the production of the new tanks for an upstate New York Company. Feldmeier has an outstanding reputation for this kind of work and has, in fact, done other work for the Genesee Brewing Company in Rochester.


As things now stand, we must express our strong disappointment that this highly-regarded local company was not given more consideration in this project. We would hope, in the future, New York companies and businesses will receive stronger support from this administration.



Sincerely,
Assemblyman Marc Butler
Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi

HOLLYWOOD, California – The very popular 2004 romantic drama film The Notebook is finally getting a sequel. Producers of the upcoming film confirmed the news today and announced that filming will begin in Jacksonville, North Carolina this summer.

A screenplay written by Nicholas Sparks was reportedly approved just last week and Nick Cassavetes is said to have signed on again as director. Also, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams will return as their characters, Noah and Allie. Few details of the upcoming film have been released so far but the short description released this morning shows that several years after their wedding the couple have moved to Jacksonville, North Carolina for a period of time before eventually returning to Seabrook. The film will take place primarily in the Jacksonville area and will film on location there as well. A casting call for extras will reportedly take place in the Jacksonville area in a couple of months.

Fans of the original film were obviously very excited about the news with #thenotebook2 very quickly becoming one of the most popular hashtags of the day. When asked why they’ve chosen to make a sequel after so many years, the producers said, “People want sequels to all of the great movies from the past and they love remakes too! I can definitely see in maybe 20 years doing a remake of The Notebook, maybe this time with an all black cast, or all Asian cast… something to mix it up, ya know?”

http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2017/oct/05/phil-berger/berger-says-nc-has-strictest-anti-gerrymandering-s/,"I hear Democrats complain that theyre not competitive in state Senate elections under the proposed maps because Republicans gerrymander the districts. Liberals in the media and academia have picked up on this theme and run with it. But in the publicly understood sense of the word, it is not true that this map is a gerrymander. Back in 2001, my first year serving in the Senate, I was one of only 15 Republicans elected to serve in this body, in a year North Carolina voted for George Bush for president by 13 points over Al Gore  56 percent to 43 percent. The Democrats promptly embarked on a redistricting scheme for the state Senate that was by any measure a severe gerrymander intended to preserve that 35-15 partisan advantage. That Democratic map  known as N.C. Senate Plan 1C  divided 51 counties. Smaller counties like Sampson and Iredell were chopped up between four districts. One western N.C. district stretched and wound across pieces of nine counties running from the Georgia border up through Asheville into McDowell County. This fracturing and severe gerrymandering of counties was a relatively recent occurrence. In fact, prior to 1982 no county had ever been divided to form a state Senate district in North Carolina. The constitutional requirement that Senate districts be made up of whole counties dates back in different forms to our states original 1776 constitution, which allotted one senator to every whole county. It was not until a 1981 U.S. Department of Justice decision that the North Carolina constitutional provision requiring counties be kept whole when drawing legislative districts violated the Voting Rights Act that our state began to see the sort of grossly gerrymandered districts like you see in the Democrats 2001 N.C. Senate Plan 1C in front of you. These sorts of grotesque districts would probably still be the norm in North Carolina, and frankly, the Democratic Party would probably still control the state Senate if not for a man from Beaufort County named Ashley Stephenson, who passed away in 2009. In 2001, Ashley Stephenson filed a lawsuit asking the state courts to enforce the whole county provision of the state constitution. He argued that the state did not have a binary choice between the whole county provision of the North Carolina Constitution and the Voting Rights Act  that in fact the state constitution and federal law could be harmonized. In the landmark 2002 Stephenson decision, the state Supreme Court agreed with him and laid out a specific method to keep counties whole while complying with federal law. The system for drawing legislative districts laid out in the Stephenson decisions  requiring districts to comply with the Voting Rights Act, have roughly equal population, elect a single senator instead of multiple senators, and, most importantly, creating a process for grouping and keeping counties whole  are the strongest anti-gerrymandering provisions for a legislature in the entire country. And the results of the decision are immediately evident: The court-ordered 2002 state Senate map following the Stephenson decision divided 16 counties. The 2003 state Senate map, adopted by the Democrats to comply with the Stephenson decision, divided 12 counties. The 2011 state Senate map, adopted by this body, divided 19 counties. And the proposed 2017 state Senate map before you today divides just 12 counties. When map drawers divide between 10 and 20 counties, they simply cannot create the sort of redistricting mischief that they can when they divide 50 plus counties. And they are forced to make decisions based on traditional districting principles over political considerations  for example, I ended up double-bunked and had a primary against former Senate Republican Leader Bob Shaw in the 2002 map. Ive heard people argue that this proposed Senate map is a political gerrymander  it is not. But the argument goes something like: Republicans and Democrats should both get about the same number of seats in the state Senate, because Pat McCrory and Roy Cooper tied at 49 percent of the vote in the governors race. This ignores a couple of things: 1) we arent a European country with proportional representation. If we were, the Libertarian, Lon Cecil, who got 2 percent of the vote for governor, would be breaking all ties between McCrory and Cooper, and 2) while the governors race was a tie, in 2016 Republican candidates for state Senate got almost 500,000 more votes than Democratic candidates. But something else has been happening that folks arguing against this map havent spoken much about. A North Carolina Democrat  as a distinct political personage and candidate type from a national Democrat  disappeared. Think about this. Back in the 1990s and early 2000s, Democrats won, on average, between 50 and 55 counties in competitive statewide races in North Carolina: 1992: 56.5 1996: 54.5 2000: 55.8 Since 2010, Democrats have averaged between 30 and 35 county wins in competitive statewide races: 2012: 35.9 2014: 32.0 2016: 31.2 Consider the number of counties Democrats won in governors races since 1992: Jim Hunt 1992: 69 Jim Hunt 1996: 73 Mike Easley 2000: 65 Mike Easley 2004: 70 Bev Perdue 2008: 60 Walter Dalton: 2012: 23 Roy Cooper 2016: 28 So just to compare: Jim Hunt LOST just 27 counties in 1996. Roy Cooper WON just 28 counties in 2016. And Roy Cooper won 63 counties in his competitive 2000 Attorney Generals race. But Roy Cooper won only 28 counties in his competitive 2016 Governors race. Thats not gerrymandering. Its happened all across the state. Lets just take a few of the more glaring county examples: In the west: Madison County: Historically, Democrats won Madison County in a slew of statewide races: 2000 Governor, Lt. Governor, Attorney General, Superintendent, Labor, and Auditor races, 2002 US Senate, 2004 Superintendent, Labor Secretary, Agriculture, Auditor, Lt. Governor, Governor, 2008 Treasurer, Superintendent, Labor, Agriculture, Auditor, Insurance, Governor and U.S. Senate. In 2016, Democrats didnt carry Madison in a single contest. President Trump won 60 percent, Sen. Burr won 57 percent to 39 percent, and statewide Republican candidates averaged at least 55 percent. Alleghany County: Democrats won Alleghany in every competitive statewide race except the race for president in 2000, and Mike Easley won the county with nearly 58 percent in 2004. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won 24 percent, Deborah Ross won 26 percent, Roy Cooper won 31 percent and Josh Stein won 34 percent. Rutherford County: Republicans averaged about 70 percent in Rutherford County in 2016. President Trump won 72 percent, Lt. Governor Forest 71 percent, Buck Newton 70 percent. Roy Cooper outperformed most of the other Democrats on the ticket by winning just 32 percent of the vote. In 2000, Roy Cooper won 45% of the vote in his close first election for Attorney General. Mike Easley won the county in 2004. Jim Hunt won it twice, in 1992 and 1996. In the Piedmont: Person County: Democrats won Person County in the overwhelming majority of statewide races in 2000, 2004 and 2008. Roy Cooper, Bev Perdue and Mike Easley each won with 57 percent in 2000. In 2016, Elaine Marshall was the only Democrat who carried the county. Clinton and Ross won just 40 percent. Cooper won 43 percent. In my home county of Rockingham: in the 1990s and 2000s, Republicans rarely won Rockingham County. It went for Jim Hunt twice, Mike Easley twice, Bev Perdue twice and Roy Cooper in his 2000 race for Attorney General. In 2016 Democrats averaged 38 percent in Rockingham County. In the two most prominent races they won: Roy Cooper and Josh Stein won 39 percent each. And most dramatically in the east: Nash County: Nash was a competitive county in 2016  Sen. Burr won with 49 percent, President Trump with 49 percent, and Lt. Governor Forest with 50 percent, while Attorney General Josh Stein won the county with 51 percent. Mike Easley and Bev Perdue each won 61 percent in Nash in 2004. Even in his home county, Roy Cooper cleaned up with 69 percent of the vote in the 2000 Attorney Generals race, but won just 52 percent in 2016. Columbus County: In 2016, Columbus County went 60 percent for President Trump, 59 percent for Sen. Burr and Pat McCrory. It went 58 percent for Lt. Governor Forest. 55 percent for Superintendent Johnson and 56 percent for Treasurer Folwell. In 2008, Bev Perdue won 65 percent, Walter Dalton 63 percent. In 2004, Democrats averaged over 63 percent in competitive statewide races in Columbus. In 2000, they averaged 68 percent. Many cleared 70 percent. In Roy Coopers 2000 race for Attorney General, he won 67 percent in Columbus County. In the 2016 race for governor, he won less than 40 percent. Sampson County: Democrats carried Sampson County in seven of the eight most competitive statewide races in 2000. They won the county in six of the eight most competitive in 2004. Since 2008, only one Democrat has won the county. Roy Cooper lost by 17 points (58 percent to 41 percent) in 2016. Robeson County: Democrats averaged 73 percent in Robeson County in 2000, 68 percent in 2004 and 67 percent in 2008. In 2016, they lost the first three races at the top the ticket. The decline in Democratic performance in Robeson County has been so sudden and so dramatic it became the subject of a national case study. Tyrrell County: In 2000 Democrats won every competitive statewide race in Tyrrell County, and their candidates averaged 71 percent. Roy Cooper won 74 percent, Mike Easley won 73 percent, and Bev Perdue got 74 percent. In 2004, Democrats won every competitive statewide race except the race for President, averaging 62 percent. In the 2016 cycle, Democrats averaged 48 percent and Cooper performed 33 points worse (41 percent) than he did in 2001. Democrats are only competing in 20 to 30 counties across the state. That might be a viable strategy for squeaking out a win in the occasional statewide race, but you cant build a legislative majority in a state with 100 counties when you only compete in a quarter of them. Do we really think all of these county shifts  these sea changes, in only a decades time  are a result of gerrymandering? Of course not. Gerrymandering didnt do that. North Carolina Democrats did that. It is why Republicans were able to take the majority in the state Senate in 2010 on a map drawn by Democrats. Granted, this trend isnt exclusive to North Carolina. Nationally, Democrats have lost over 900 legislative seats since 2010, not to mention the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Senate and the White House. A News & Observer headline two days after the 2010 midterms wiped Democrats out of the U.S. House read: Obama voices regrets but signals no change of course. And the losses kept coming  in 2012, 2014, and 2016. Thats not a gerrymandering problem. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report said maybe about 17 percent of the Democratic Partys woes nationally are a result of gerrymandering. Something clearly happened, while Democrats were blaming gerrymandering for keeping them on the back row. When I first ran for the state Senate, many of the Democrats running shared the cultural values of North Carolinas moderate to conservative voters. They were pro-education but also pro-business, pro-gun and pro-life candidates. But today North Carolina Democrats, just like the national Democrats, align with the powerful special interests like big national labor unions, far-left environmentalists and the abortion lobby. It used to be that a North Carolina Democrat wouldnt be caught dead with a national Democratic presidential candidate like Michael Dukakis, Walter Mondale or John Kerry. Nowadays, they rush out to get endorsements from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. It used to be North Carolina Democrats campaigned all over rural North Carolina. In 2016, they were nowhere to be seen outside of the big cities. Its easy to understand why gerrymandering has been the boogeyman since Democrats were swept out of power in 2010. Its easier to blame the maps, blame a process  blame anything, really  than it is to take responsibility for losing touch with the politics of voters in 75 of North Carolinas 100 counties. But heres the hard truth: Democrats could be competitive in legislative elections all over the state, if they tried to compete in all 100 counties instead of only 30  in fact, there are more registered Democratic voters than Republican voters in 27 of the proposed districts. But if youre going to be competitive in legislative elections across the state, youre going to have to bring back the North Carolina Democrat as a distinct political type, separate from the national Democrat. And the North Carolina Constitution requires legislative districts to be constructed out of whole counties. So unless you think the county lines in our state have been gerrymandered, its pretty clear this is not a political gerrymander. And if the North Carolina Democratic Partys struggles do elect Republican Senators under this map, it isnt because of the way the lines are drawn, but the platform that partys candidates are running on. But we are not here today because of a political gerrymandering claim. We are here today to adopt a new legislative redistricting plan because the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the 2011 state Senate map, ruling that nine of the districts included in the map were racial gerrymanders. I think it is very important that we acknowledge this  the District Court ruled and the Supreme Court affirmed that the 2011 map was a racial gerrymander. In 2011, the legislature made a decision, based on the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Strickland case, to draw the minority districts required by the Voting Rights Act with African-American voting age populations of at least 50 percent. The trial court ruled that interpretation of the Strickland decision was an error of law. And while the court acknowledged that: In reaching this conclusion, we make no finding that the General Assembly acted in bad faith or with discriminatory intent in drawing the challenged districts, which were precleared by the Justice Department pursuant to Section 5 of the VRA, The courts ruling must be respected and the error of law that resulted in the racial gerrymanders must be corrected. The U.S. Supreme Court has set several new precedents since this body last adopted legislative district maps. Most consequentially, the Supreme Court rendered Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act inoperative in Shelby County v. Holder. The Shelby County decision is important to understanding how we are seeking to comply with the courts order. To simplify, prior to Shelby County, North Carolinas redistricting plans were subject to Section 5 preclearance by the United States Justice Department. The burden fell on the state to prove the proposed plans did not unfairly limit the opportunity of minority groups to elect candidates of their choice. Today, post Shelby County, North Carolinas redistricting plans are not subject to Justice Department preclearance. And the burden of proving that a plan limits a minority groups opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice would rest with a plaintiff in a court challenge. Sen. Blue spoke Friday in detail about the Gingles factors that would allow the legislature to consider race in drawing a district: 1) That a geographically compact minority community exists for which a majority-minority district can be drawn. 2) That the minority community votes cohesively. 3) That the white majority typically votes together in sufficient numbers to block the minority community from electing a candidate of their choice. I wont expand on Sen. Blues comments on the first two Gingles criteria, but want to elaborate on the third criterion. In 2011, the legislature commissioned two expert studies on racially polarized voting in North Carolina to support the decision to draw districts with African-American voting age populations of 50 percent. To my knowledge these were the most complete and exhaustive studies ever entered into the record during a redistricting process. In the Covington decision striking down the 2011 legislative maps, the court cited those legislative decisions as critical to determining the plan was a racial gerrymander. The court determined the expert reports did not sufficiently prove racially polarized voting to prove the third Gingles factor was present and justify drawing 50 percent minority districts: Contrary to Defendants contentions, the Block and Brunell reports do not establish a strong basis in evidence for Gingles third factor in any potential district. And in light of the 2014 Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v Alabama ruling, the court strongly objected to the legislatures decision to adopt a 50 percent target to draw true minority majority districts: in light of Alabama, we are mindful that a legislatures policy of prioritizing mechanical racial targets above all other districting criteria (save one-person, one-vote) provides particularly strong evidence of racial predominance. We have carefully considered the courts order in Covington. Given the courts rejection of the 2011 expert reports we do not believe we can develop a strong enough basis in evidence that the third Gingles factor is present to justify drawing districts on the basis of race. Nor, in spite of repeated requests by the redistricting committees, have the public, plaintiffs in the Covington litigation or members of this body presented evidence that the proposed map should be changed because the third Gingles factor is present and unaddressed. So I strongly believe we have complied with the courts admonishment that:  if during redistricting the General Assembly had followed traditional districting criteria and, in doing so, drawn districts that incidentally contained majority-black populations, race would not have predominated in drawing those districts. With the information available to them, Sen. Hise and the Redistricting Committee adopted nine criteria to use in drawing this proposed map. Some of the map-drawing principles are inviolable and must be followed, like equal population, contiguity, the N.C. constitutional requirements on county groupings and, because we cannot prove the third Gingles criterion, not using racial data. Other criteria like keeping precincts whole, compactness, election data, incumbency protection and municipal boundaries are secondary and occasionally internally contradictory considerations. They must be harmonized with each other while complying with the inviolable criteria. I believe that this redistricting plan put forward by Sen. Hises committee successfully harmonized the criteria adopted. This map is not a racial gerrymander and fully complies with both the court order and traditional redistricting principles. I have also reviewed the data Sen. McKissick requested and has placed on the member dashboard. In the nine districts the court ruled were racial gerrymanders, only the Guilford County district 28  as the court predicted could incidentally occur when using traditional districting principles, in this case following Greensboros municipal boundary  continues to have a black voting age population over 50 percent, and it has fallen from 56.5 percent to 50.5 percent. The other eight previously unconstitutional districts now have black voting age populations ranging from 32.9 percent to 48.5 percent. While the 2011 map had no districts with black voting age populations between 26.5 percent and 43 percent, the new map has five new districts that fall in that range, including one new district with a black voting age population over 40 percent and two new districts with over 30 percent. This is important because the expert reports  which you can see on your dashboard  submitted by Allan Lichtman on behalf of the Democrats and plaintiffs in the Covington and Harris cases define all those districts as having the ability to elect a candidate who is the preferred choice of a cohesively voting minority community. So while race was not used to draw this plan, I believe it fully remedies the racial gerrymander in the previous map while avoiding any new potential claims of vote dilution under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In closing, Ill say again: this map is not a racial gerrymander. This map is not a political gerrymander, either. It complies with state and federal law. It adheres to traditional districting principles. It remedies defects the court found in the previous map. It splits fewer counties. It divides far fewer precincts and fewer municipalities. For those reasons, I ask for your support."
http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2018/mar/15/mark-harris/robert-pittenger-among-most-liberal-republican-con/,"Please read and share my statement on this morning's budget vote: While most Americans were asleep last night, Congress passed a massive spending bill further mortgaging the future of our kids and grandkids. Every special interest was funded in this budget that left Chuck Schumer and Democrats walking away smiling. Its unfathomable that even funding for Planned Parenthood was included after a promise from Republicans in Congress to defund them after all the controversy that they reportedly kept babies alive to harvest their organs. While nearly every Republican Member of the US House from North and South Carolina stood up against this reckless and irresponsible measure, our Congressman from the 9th district, Robert Pittenger, showed us yet again why he is constantly rated as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress. He has once again sided against North Carolina conservatives like Virginia Foxx, Richard Hudson, Mark Walker, Ted Budd, and Mark Meadows. As a matter of fact, out of the 10 Republicans in the NC delegation, only 2 of them went along with continuing to bankrupt our economic future. Sadly, Robert Pittenger was one of those two. As usual, he is running for cover and blaming the process for his vote. This is another example of why the 9th district needs an active voice to be an advocate for fiscal responsibility and stand up for the conservative principles our nation was founded on. We dont need a weak representative who will blindly follow orders from House leadership and special interests. Every day when I meet with voters, I hear a consistent message, Enough is enough! Its time for Republicans to start acting like Republicans again. Stand with me to send a message to the Washington Establishment that we will not sit by and watch them continue to spend our country into bankruptcy. Enough is enough! Mark Mark Harris"
http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2010/dec/06/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-assails-tax-deductions-fast-fo/,"A new study from the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University confirms that efforts to market fast food to children are effective and rapidly expanding.  The study’s conclusions drew more attention to the nearly $2 billion annual tax break the industry claims for marketing junk food and fast food to children.  Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) is calling for adoption of his legislation, HR 4310, that would revoke tax breaks for marketing fast food and junk food to children.

“We are spending millions, if not billions of dollars every year on programs to fight the childhood obesity epidemic while giving almost $2 billion of taxpayer money to the junk food and fast food industries to make the epidemic worse,” said Kucinich.

The number of overweight children in the U.S. would be reduced by more than 5-7% if H.R. 4310 were enacted, according to a peer-reviewed paper published in the Journal of Law and Economics in 2008. 

Fast food and junk food marketing to children is big business because it works.  A child’s developing brain cannot tell the difference between fact and opinion and cannot yet think critically.  It is no match for an industry that exploits this vulnerability by using cartoons, product placement in video games, cross-branding with popular toys, giveaways, and myriad other methods to develop brand loyalties and taste preferences as early as possible.

“It’s one thing to allow this type of predatory marketing to proliferate like this, but using taxpayer money to encourage it is reprehensible.  We cannot credibly claim to be searching for solutions to childhood obesity if we don’t address corporate obesity marketing to children,” said Kucinich.

The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that H.R. 4310 could provide $15-19 billion over the next ten years for child nutrition programs. The House version of the child nutrition reauthorization requires an $8.5 billion offset over 10 years while the Senate version requires a $4.5 billion offset over 10 years. The child nutrition bill that Congress is scheduled to consider is funded by cutting food stamps.

Regular unleaded was $3.79 a gallon. Some Ohioans are already seeing gas prices over four dollars per gallon, and higher prices may be on the horizon. This makes it more expensive to commute, drive to the store or take a vacation. Because oil fuels every major sector of our economy, rising gas prices have a less visible, but no less costly, impact on all of us. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 94 percent of all consumer goods and 68 percent of all farm goods are transported over Americas roads. As the cost of shipping and producing goods increases, we will find ourselves paying more for everything from groceries to electronics. Oil prices are on the rise for a host of reasons. As the global economy slowly recovers, demand for oil is rising to meet new manufacturing and other needs. The laws of supply and demand kick in. Unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, including oil-rich Libya, has also injected uncertainty into the energy markets, which results in price hikes. Some experts also suggest that the oil market is factoring in expected inflation due to global deficit spending, especially the record federal government debt in the United States. Still others point to the actions of speculators and their illegal actions driving up the cost of oil. The Obama Administration recently announced the formation of a new task force to look at fraud and manipulation within oil and energy markets. Any price fixing or other illegal activity should be prosecuted. But I don't think we need a task force to tell us what we need to do as a country to respond to yet another spike in oil prices: we need to move aggressively to get away from our dependence on foreign oil and this must include using more of our own resources. For decades, Washington, D.C. has been unwilling to tap the energy resources in our own backyard. This policy simply makes no sense in the worlds largest oil-consuming nation. The United States today consumes about 22 percent of the worlds oil supply  much of it from countries hostile to American interests and ideals. Last year alone, we spent $337 billion on oil imports, more than half of what we spent on our nations defense, and we have not been self-sufficient in energy production since 1970. There is a better way to power Americas economic future. What we need are common-sense solutions to strengthen U.S. energy production. That begins with harnessing the potential of our own natural resources in an environmentally responsible way. As an immediate bridge, we should increase access for oil exploration and production in energy-rich areas of the country like the Outer Continental Shelf, and in parts of Alaska. This will create jobs, drive investment, and immediately reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil. We must also look to alternatives to oil, recognizing that true innovation will come from private-sector entrepreneurs, engineers, and scientists  not from the Washington bureaucracy. Thats why it is critical to eliminate unnecessary rules and regulations that slow the development of cleaner, more affordable energy. Less red tape will free businesses to grow, innovate, and create new jobs. The good news is that Ohio is poised help lead Americas energy future. Ohio has a long history of producing its own energy sources, with an oil, gas, and coal business that pre-dates the Civil War. Today, Ohio is preparing for a natural gas shale revolution  a new means of tapping energy-rich underground rock formations. Considering the potential of the Marcellus and Utica Shale Formations, we have the possibility of creating good Ohio jobs while providing Ohioans with access to large quantities of cleaner-burning natural gas that can be used today for buses, taxis and other fleets and could be used for cars in the future. Where natural gas is used for transportation fuel today, the average cost per gallon is less than $2.00. These new breakthroughs in Ohio energy production can build on the longstanding strength of our Ohio coal industry. Coal is a proven source of relatively inexpensive energy that supports thousands of jobs across Ohio. Clean coal technology continues to develop, and, with the help of research being done at Ohio's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, coal-to-liquid could become another affordable domestic alternative to oil. Ohio also continues to be a leading producer of bio-fuels. We currently have five operating plants, producing 424 million gallons of ethanol annually and contributing hundreds of jobs and millions of dollars of economic activity to Ohios rural economy. Research and new cellulosic ethanol technologies are making home-grown Ohio bio-fuels more cost-effective and should be encouraged through further research and investments. Ohio is also a leader on fuel cell research and other clean technologies to power the cars of the future. As these examples show, America has the know-how and the natural abundance to move toward a future of energy independence. But we must make the right choices today. It is time to unleash the ingenuity of our workforce and the potential of our energy resources to power the American economy and create new jobs  with Ohio leading the way."
http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/sep/19/mary-taylor/lt-gov-mary-taylor-says-obamacare-would-require-pu/,"9/8/2011 Guest Column: Obamacare Suggests Government Knows Best - Not the Consumer Page Content By Mary Taylor Ohio Lt. Gov. and Insurance Director Obamacare is so complex that only a few of its impacts have been widely publicized. In fact, many of the laws far reaching mandates and requirements are still being defined by Washington bureaucrats. But as you look closer at some of its lesser known provisions, one thing becomes clear: the authors of Obamacare are more concerned with a government takeover of health care and less worried about you the consumer and the increasing cost of health insurance because of this laws mandates. Here are just three of the major market changes  among many  that all Ohioans should understand. First, the laws heavy-handed mandates force insurance companies to include coverage for many benefits and services you may not want. Say for example, you do not have any children. Under Obamacare, you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric, maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it. Such mandates remove consumerism from the process and replace it with a one-size-fits-all approach. By requiring consumers to buy services they do not want or need, costs will rise significantly. Second, Obamacare limits the deductible amount a consumer can choose to pay each year. Today, similar to car or home insurance, health insurance can be purchased with high deductibles or low deductibles impacting the monthly premium you pay. Obamacare limits high deductible plans leaving consumers with fewer choices. These restrictions, however, have not yet been clearly defined by Washington bureaucrats who could make them even worse. Third, Obamacare squeezes the rating rules for insurance carriers in Ohio forcing some to pay higher premiums. This means you will no longer pay premiums for health insurance based on your choices and lifestyle as much as you do today. For example, insurance companies can currently rate an individual on a wide array of factors such as health status, occupation, and tobacco use. Because there are so many factors, there is more competition among insurance companies resulting in more options and lower costs for consumers. But when Obamacare is fully implemented there will be only four rating factors permitted under law. Those are age, family status, geographic location and tobacco use. By narrowing the playing field, consumers will have less control over their health care costs based on the decisions they make compared to todays laws. And because choices are no longer rewarded, insurance companies will be forced to treat everyone the same resulting in skyrocketing premiums for many low-risk, health conscious consumers. Simply put, these changes all have one theme in common  government knows best. In other words you the consumer do not know how to buy insurance for yourself; you need the government to tell you what you must purchase. There is no consumer-driven, market-based approach when Obamacare is fully implemented. Choices will be limited, mandates will be increased and costs will continue to rise but at a much faster pace. The intent behind the law seems clear. Obamacare is government telling you what you must have  it is not a solution that provides you with the health care options that you want and need. Mary Taylor is Ohios 65th Lieutenant Governor. She was sworn into office on January 10, 2011, the same day Governor John R. Kasich named her to serve as the director of the Ohio Department of Insurance and to lead CSI Ohio: The Common Sense Initiative to reform Ohios regulatory policies. NOTE: This is the second in a series of columns by Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor focused on Obamacares consequences and costs to Ohioans."
http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/jul/20/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-obamacare-will-ultimately-be-bigg/,"Columbus, Ohio -- Today’s Supreme Court decision sets the stage for the November election. Now, the only way the American people can stop the federal government’s takeover of health care is to change the people we send to Washington. Sherrod Brown cast the deciding vote for the Affordable Care Act that Ohio voters overwhelmingly rejected last November. Josh Mandel believes that the legislation must be fully repealed in order to reduce costs, protect access, and prevent this bill from doing further harm to the economy.

Please see the below statement:

“Sherrod Brown staked his 38-year political career on casting the deciding vote for what will likely go down as the biggest tax increase in history. This is not just any old tax increase, it is a tax increase that falls squarely upon the shoulders of the poor, the middle class, and small businesses that can least afford to pay it. Even worse, this law increases the cost of care, puts government bureaucrats between patients and their doctors, and hurts the ability of private sector job creators in Ohio to give their workers the benefits they deserve. The voters of Ohio overwhelmingly rejected this one-size-fits-all approach last November, and I am confident they will do so again this November.

We can fix the problems in our health care system without a federal takeover and without a massive new tax on the poor and middle class. As Senator, I will fight for market-based solutions that allow patients to choose their doctor without government interference. I will fight to reduce the cost of insurance by increasing competition, encouraging innovative ideas like association health plans and health savings accounts, and reducing junk lawsuits that drive up the cost of everyone’s medical care. The choice in this election is between taxing the uninsured to pay for a big government plan that takes away freedom and a free market plan that reduces costs, increases access to high quality care, and protects the relationship between doctors and their patients.” -- State Treasurer Josh Mandel, Republican Candidate For U.S. Senate

 

SHERROD BROWN FAVORS GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE

Brown Said He was ""Concerned"" The Supreme Court Would Rule Against Obamacare

In November 2011, Sherrod Brown Said He Was “Concerned” The Supreme Court Would Rule Against The Health Care Law Because The Justices “Decide For Insurance Companies, They Decide For Oil Companies, They Decide For The Wealthy Too Often.” “While the lawmakers are not second-guessing the administration’s legal strategy, some are clearly bracing for defeat. ‘Of course I’m concerned,’ said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). The justices ‘decide for insurance companies, they decide for oil companies, they decide for the wealthy too often.’” (Julian Pecquet, “Dems Fear Supreme Court Will Rule Against Obama On Healthcare Reform,” The Hill’s Healthwatch Blog, 11/14/11)

Brown Supported The Individual Mandate

Brown Pushed A Senate Bill That Would Require Every American To Have Insurance. “Brown is pushing a Senate bill that would require every American to have insurance, mandate that businesses offer coverage to their employees and prevent insurers from turning away those with pre-existing conditions.” (Jim Siegel and Jonathan Riskind, “Health-Care Supporters Rally,” The Columbus Dispatch, 9/2/09)

Brown Said “Maybe” The Mandate Is “Not Ideal,” But “It’s The Best Way For The Most People In The Country.” “‘Maybe it’s not ideal – it’s certainly not communism,’ said Mr. Brown, who voted for the reform measure and wrote part of the law. ‘It’s the best way for the most people in the country.’” (Julie M. McKinnon, “Sen. Brown Defends Rule Requiring Insurance,” Toledo Blade, 1/3/11)

Brown Voted To Kill An Amendment That Would Have Removed The Individual Mandate From The Health Care Bill. “Baucus, D-Mont., motion to table (kill) the Ensign, R-Nev. amendment no. 3710 that would repeal provisions of the 2010 health care overhaul law that provide for IRS penalties for certain taxpayers that do not obtain basic health insurance coverage.” (H.R. 4872, CQ Vote #101: Motion agreed to 58-40: R 0-40; D 56-0; I 2-0, 3/25/10, Brown Voted Yea)

Brown Opposed Ohio's Attorney General Joining The Lawsuit Against Obamacare

In January 2011, Brown Criticized Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine For Joining The Lawsuit Against Health Care Reform, Saying “I Think He Should Stay Out Of It.” “Ohio’s DeWine also campaigned on his opposition to the law and said the lawsuit will be a priority. … That brought criticism Tuesday from Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat who defeated DeWine in the 2006 U.S. Senate election. ‘I’m sorry my tax dollars are going to be used to take benefits away from seniors,’ Brown said in a conference call with reporters, referring to the law’s discounts on prescription drugs for seniors who fall into the Medicare prescription drug doughnut hole. ‘I think he should stay out of it.’” (Jane Norman, “Health Care Law Faces Attacks In The Courts From New Republican AGs,” Congressional Quarterly, 1/4/11)

Brown Said He Hoped Republicans “Will Focus More On Job Growth Than On Scoring Political Points.” “‘The American people want us to focus on jobs, not on re-debating a health-care law that is already providing benefits to seniors and already is providing benefits to people with pre-existing conditions,’ Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown said. ‘I hope they (Republicans) will focus more on job growth than on scoring political points.’” (Jack Torry and Jonathan Riskind, “The Reign Of Boehner Will Begin Today,” The Columbus Dispatch, 1/5/11)

Brown Voted To Pass The Health Care Reconciliation Bill. (H.R. 4872, CQ Vote #105: Passed 56-43: R 0-40; D 54-3; I 2-0, 3/25/10, Brown Voted Yea)

BROWN: “[I] Think That This Bill Is Such A Huge Step Forward For Our Country. Of Course I Wanted The Public Option. I Wanted Medicare For All. But This Is Huge Progress, And We’re Going To Continue To Improve It. Senator Kennedy Always Said The Fight For Reform Never Ends, And There Are Lots Of Things We’ll Want To Do As We See How This Bill Unfolds In The Next Four Years.” (MSNBC’s, “Morning Joe,” 3/24/10)

Brown Praised, And Voted To Confirm, Elena Kagan And Sonya Sotomayor

Brown Voted To Confirm Sonia Sotomayor’s Appointment To The Supreme Court. “Confirmation of President Obama’s nomination of Sonia Sotomayor of New York to be an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.” (CQ Vote #262: Confirmed 68-31: R 9-31; D 57-0; I 2-0, 8/6/09, Brown Voted Yea)

Brown Said Sotomayor Would Be “Tough, Fair And Thoughtful.” “‘Judge Sotomayor has demonstrated that she will be a tough, fair and thoughtful justice while bringing new insight to the U.S. Supreme Court,’ he said after the vote. ‘Combined with her impressive experience - more federal judicial experience than any other nominee in more than a century - I am confident that Judge Sotomayor will be an outstanding addition to the court.’” (Malia Rulon, “Ohio, Ky. Senators Split On Sotomayor,” The Cincinnati Enquirer, 8/7/09)
Brown Voted To Confirm Elena Kagan’s Appointment To The Supreme Court. “Confirmation of President Obama’s nomination of Elena Kagan of Massachusetts to be an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.” (CQ Vote #229: Confirmed 63-37: R 5-36; D 56-1; I 2-0, 8/5/10, Brown Voted Yea)

Today, the Friends of Sherrod Brown campaign responded to an invitation from the City Club of Cleveland, agreeing to either of two proposed dates for a debate with Josh Mandel. Josh Mandel, who has cemented his reputation as politician who cant be trusted by doubling down on lies that have been thoroughly debunked as false, refusing to tell Ohioans where he stands on critical issues and even running away from reporters, now must make good on his campaign pledge to debate at The City Club and choose one of the following proposed dates: October 1, or 8. Sen. Sherrod Brown immediately accepted the debate invitation from the City Club. Will Josh Mandel? The City Club provides the perfect venue for Josh Mandel to finally come clean by explaining his promise to repeat debunked lies from now through November, his refusal to tell Ohioans where he stands on critical issues like Sherrods bill to crack down on Chinese currency manipulation and the numerous scandals that have plagued his office since his swearing in, said Sadie Weiner, spokesperson for Friends of Sherrod Brown. Sherrod looks forwarding to debating Josh Mandel, while Ohioans eagerly anticipate the opportunity for Josh to explain his numerous anti-middle class positions and defend his decisions to hire unqualified political cronies in the Treasurers office, blow off more than a year of billion-dollar investment meetings and accept shady campaign cash we now know is connected to an FBI probe.

Instead of working in a bipartisan way to fulfill his promise, the president went on a stimulus-fueled spending binge that stuck every American man, woman, and child with a $50,000 share of this $16 trillion national debt. This debt is a drain on our economy and a crushing burden on our kids and grandkids, and its yet another indication that the presidents policies have made things worse. To tackle the debt in a meaningful way and help our economy grow, we need pro-growth tax reform, and we need to strengthen and secure Medicare and other critical entitlement programs. Unfortunately, President Obama hasnt had the courage to join us in working on these common-sense reforms. Instead, hes still pushing a tax hike on small businesses that would destroy more than 700,000 jobs, and letting Medicare go bankrupt.

http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2016/jun/20/steve-chabot/ohios-steve-chabot-compares-trump-u-clinton-founda/,"Donald, as I’ve said a number of times over the past few months, if you’re to have any chance of defeating Hillary Clinton in November, you’ve got to step up your game. During the primary process, you got away with saying a number of really dumb things – some would say that not following the normal rules of political correctness even benefited you. Maybe so.

But your latest faux pas is a real doozy. You’ve accused the federal judge who’s handling the Trump U case, of “having an inherent conflict of interest”, merely because “he is of Mexican heritage.” I know you want to build a wall and all (so do I), but the guy was born in Indiana. In this country, we’ve never held where an American citizen was born, or where their parents or their grandparents were born, against them. And we shouldn’t start now.

Besides, you should have settled this case long ago. As you know, it stems from your involvement in, what seems to me, one of those get-rich-quick deals – this one promising folks that they could learn the secrets of your success in real estate, for the rock bottom price of only $1,500 (to $35,000 for the Gold Elite program.) Lawsuits have been filed against you in New York and California. It’s not clear that legally you’ve done anything wrong, but it looks, well it looks terrible. And as a recovering lawyer myself, let me give you some free legal advice – settle the damn case, and apologize to the judge.

That being said, whereas the mainstream press is all over your Trump U flap, they’re not surprisingly all but ignoring far greater Clinton scandals. For example, Laureate Education, a for-profit college under criminal investigation, funneled over $16 million to Bill Clinton, at the same time the State Department, under none other than Hillary Clinton, shoveled $55 million to the so-called college’s founder, a guy named Douglas Becker. (There are George Soros fingerprints all over this deal too.) According to reports, “unprepared students from impoverished nations” were preyed upon, and lured in by millions of dollars spent on “aggressive telemarketing, billboards, and flashy internet banner ads.” Sound familiar?

And as you know, Donald, the Clinton Foundation scandals go far beyond corruption with just one college. Even a cursory review of the inner workings of the Clinton Foundation reveal troubling facts. Even the Obama Administration recognized the inherent conflict of interest issues with respect to the Clinton Foundation, and therefore recommended a ban on all contributions to the Foundation from foreign nations. The Clintons violated that ban time and time again, and accepted millions and millions of dollars from governments like Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and United Arab Emirates.

It’s not just foreign governments that gave millions of questionable dollars to the Clinton Foundation, apparently to buy access to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and potentially from future President Hillary Clinton. It’s also huge corporations (the true enemy of all things good, according to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama and sometimes Hillary Clinton). Corporations like ExxonMobil, Citigroup, Pfizer, GE, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, McDonald’s, Walmart, and on and on. All told, Clinton interests have received a shocking $2 billion, maybe more, and all with nothing expected in return. Right.

So look, Donald, it’s pretty clear to me, that when it comes to ripping off the public, you’re a piker compared to Hillary and Bill Clinton. The difference is, the mainstream press will use every resource available to it, to dig into and expose, everything you’ve ever done, and everything you’ve ever said, or will say, to make you look bad. But with the Clintons, they’ll yawn, make excuses, ignore, and even defend them – that’s just the way it is.

Donald, I know it’s not fair. Nobody said it would be. You’ve just got to stay focused on what you’ll do – to make America great again. How you intend to get the economy moving – get Americans back to work. How you’ll cut waste in the government – and what is worth saving, like Social Security, and how you’ll do it. And how you intend to make sure that Americans feel, and are, safe again – whether it’s from illegal immigration, or from ISIS.

Don’t worry about what country a judge’s parents came from. And much as I hate to quote Hillary Clinton, “What difference at this point does it make?”"

The default rate for students ten years ago was about 40%. Then students were borrowing only one-third of what they are borrowing today, when the default rate approaches 50%. Perhaps as many as 800,000 young Ohioans are facing default on their student loans.  Ohio is one of the most expensive states from where a student can receive a college education.  Ohio currently ranks the 16th highest in college student loan debt. We will develop an innovative program to help young Ohioans get out from under the mountain of debt in which many are buried. Protecting the financial future of young Ohioans means: Power to We the people.

Ohio Elementary and Secondary Education
Public education is in a state of continual financial crisis. The state legislature has not kept its responsibility to establish and to finance a thorough and efficient system of public education, mandated by the DeRolph court decision. Worse, Ohio public schools lose more than a billion dollars a year to charters run by for-profit operators, without local taxpayers having any say. This has resulted in cutbacks in teachers, staff, athletic programs, arts, drama, band and other important school programs. It is time for a new direction in public education where we preserve public educational funds and we enable communities to vote whether they want local tax dollars to go to charter schools that partner with our public schools. We also need to understand the underlying dissatisfaction with public schools and address these issues to restore public confidence in public education. We must determine the best practices of charters which can be applied to public education. I will soon announce a state-wide initiative, working with teachers, parents, students and educational advocates, to protect public educational funding. Saving public education means: Power to We the People.

Ohio Arts
Ohio is already blessed with tremendous institutions in the arts, poetry, literature, music, dance, dramatics, appreciation of diverse cultures, computer graphics and motion pictures. I intend to bring forward initiatives to enable the artists of this state to thrive, to make Ohio a center for creativity in the arts, a center for film production, a place of fun, festival and celebration. Supporting Ohio Arts means: Power to We the People.

Peaceful Ohio Communities
I will endeavor to bring a healing hand to this state so that we can address violence and its causes. Two months before 911, I brought to Congress landmark legislation which would teach respect and mutuality in our schools to strengthen our children to have the fortitude to successfully integrate nonviolent responses into their daily lives. Violence is not inevitable. It is a learned response. We have the economic, academic, social, medical and spiritual resources in this state to begin the transformation to a healthy, peaceful society. I will enlist the help of ministers, social workers, medical personnel and the media in beginning a dynamic, comprehensive approach to violence.

In the Federal Register of November 8, 2011, Acting Administrator of Agricultural Marketing David R. Shipman announced that the Secretary of Agriculture will appoint a Christmas Tree Promotion Board. The purpose of the Board is to run a program of promotion, research, evaluation, and information designed to strengthen the Christmas tree industrys position in the marketplace; maintain and expend existing markets for Christmas trees; and to carry out programs, plans, and projects designed to provide maximum benefits to the Christmas tree industry (7 CFR 1214.46(n)). And the program of information is to include efforts to enhance the image of Christmas trees and the Christmas tree industry in the United States (7 CFR 1214.10). To pay for the new Federal Christmas tree image improvement and marketing program, the Department of Agriculture imposed a 15-cent fee on all sales of fresh Christmas trees by sellers of more than 500 trees per year (7 CFR 1214.52). And, of course, the Christmas tree sellers are free to pass along the 15-cent Federal fee to consumers who buy their Christmas trees. Acting Administrator Shipman had the temerity to say the 15-cent mandatory Christmas tree fee is not a tax nor does it yield revenue for the Federal government (76 CFR 69102). The Federal government mandates that the Christmas tree sellers pay the 15-cents per tree, whether they want to or not. The Federal government directs that the revenue generated by the 15-cent fee goes to the Board appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out the Christmas tree program established by the Secretary of Agriculture. Mr. President, thats a new 15-cent tax to pay for a Federal program to improve the image and marketing of Christmas trees. Nobody is saying President Obama doesnt have authority to impose his new Christmas Tree Tax  his Administration cites the Commodity Promotion, Research and Information Act of 1996. Just because the Obama Administration has the legal power to impose its Christmas Tree Tax doesnt mean it should do so. The economy is barely growing and nine percent of the American people have no jobs. Is a new tax on Christmas trees the best President Obama can do? And, by the way, the American Christmas tree has a great image that doesnt need any help from the government.

http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2011/sep/10/matt-wand/rep-matt-wand-says-using-kicker-money-has-failed-s/,"By Brent Barton Standard & Poor's decision to downgrade the credit rating of the United States from AAA to AA+ has provoked violent reactions from Washington and Wall Street alike. This sudden attention to credit ratings should cast light on an opportunity closer to home: Oregon taxpayers could save hundreds of millions of dollars if the state of Oregon improves its credit rating from AA+ to AAA, and we could take a giant step toward this goal by diverting the corporate and personal kickers into a rainy day fund. If the past week has demonstrated anything, it is the enduring importance of the three major credit ratings agencies: Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Their opinions remain important despite a pattern of spectacular misjudgment. For example, these ratings agencies stamped AAA ratings on the toxic mortgage-backed securities that helped tank the American economy. The rating agencies justified these opinions at the time by arguing, essentially, that by bundling junk mortgages from around the country, investment banks had transformed bad loans into safe investments by diversifying garbage. Many people relied on this opinion, most notably our friends at AIG. Given this context, one almost admires the sheer nerve of Standard & Poor's in downgrading the credit rating of the United States. Despite this history of incompetence, the ratings agencies' opinions remain important, particularly with respect to lesser-known investments. This category includes bonds sold by the state of Oregon to construct roads, prisons and even university buildings. The better Oregon's credit rating, the cheaper it is to build things. Treasurer Ted Wheeler estimates that a better credit rating would save approximately $4.3 million for every $100 million in debt over the life of a bond. Given that the state supports $7.8 billion in bonds, a better credit rating would save hundreds of millions of dollars. Most of this money comes from the state's general fund and could otherwise support schools. The ratings agencies will not upgrade Oregon's credit rating until we stabilize state finances, and they realize that our instability stems in large part from Oregon's kicker system. When evaluating Oregon bonds earlier this year, Moody's observed: ""The constitutional 2 percent 'kicker' that requires refunds of personal and/or corporate income taxes if collections are 2 percent or greater than the budgeted amount ... adds budgetary challenges, including cash flow pressures."" There is a reason no other state has adopted Oregon's kicker system. Incompetent as the ratings agencies may be, they recognize that Oregon's approach to public finance is unstable and, thus, unwise. The best thing we can do to stabilize state government is to divert the kicker into an emergency fund dedicated to protecting vital services. This precaution would liberate Oregon from its financial roller coaster and potentially save hundreds of millions of dollars by improving its credit rating. Brent Barton is an attorney who formerly represented east Clackamas County in the Oregon House of Representatives. He thanks the office of Treasurer Ted Wheeler for providing the figures cited in this column."

Clackamas County is one of several agencies – along with the federal government, the cities of Milwaukie and Portland, Multnomah County, Metro and the Oregon Department of Transportation – partnering with TriMet to fund the 7.3-mile line from Portland State University to Oak Grove. The new line, the second light rail line to connect Clackamas County with the rest of the Portland Metro region, is expected to open in 2015.

Our members work hard to protect the public, while working with inmates incarcerated in 13 prisons throughout the state. While the majority of our members are corrections officers, we also represent counselors, dentists, food service workers, nurses, maintenance and clerical workers, among others. These jobs are tough, stressful and sometimes dangerous. The Oregon Legislature and governor are currently considering how to close a $340 million budget hole because tax revenues are less than expected when forecast last May. Part of a budget deal announced on the first day of this year's legislative session would close the Santiam Correctional Institution southeast of Salem. The estimated savings after closure in June would be $1.6 million. The governor and the Legislature should reconsider this plan. The closure plan and the numbers don't add up. The closure is a knee-jerk reaction to a real budget problem. The Santiam Correctional Institution holds 440 inmates. It is a minimum-security facility. Typically, minimum-security facilities are the cheapest to operate, followed by medium-security, with maximum-security facilities at the highest cost per inmate. The legislative plan is to release none of the 440 inmates, but ship them to other prisons throughout Oregon. Under the current plan, 50 percent of these minimum-security inmates would be then imprisoned in a higher-cost medium-security facility. All the 440 inmates would be pushed into an already overcrowded prison system. We have 395 inmates pushed into triple-bunked cells intended for two inmates and bunked in classrooms and areas supposed to be designated for inmate labor. We have units that were designated for 80 inmates with 120 inmates, with only one corrections officer supervising these inmates. We have units with blind spots, including no sightline to the bathroom, with only one corrections officer supervising 80 to 100 inmates. The plan to send 440 more inmates into an overcrowded system would create dangerous and hazardous work for our members and the inmates. Prison overcrowding leads to assaults on staff and other inmates and to lawsuits. The Department of Corrections believes it would have to reopen the facility 12 to 18 months later because of inmate population growth. The leadership of this union is opposed to the closure of the Santiam facility. Department leadership has asked legislators to let them find the $1.6 million of cuts in the budget of the whole department. Legislators should do their jobs to monitor budget needs, but none of them has ever even run a prison. Let the managers and workers at the Department of Corrections put together a plan to save $1.6 million. Don't close the Santiam Correctional Institution. Ken Allen is the executive director of Oregon Council 75 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees."

http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2012/sep/07/cnsnews/oregon-do-15-year-olds-have-complete-control-over-/,"HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, President Barack Obama and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the White House on March 23, 2010, the day Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (White House Photo/Pete Souza) (CNSNews.com) - Thanks to an Obamacare regulation that took effect on Aug. 1, health care plans in Oregon will now be required to provide free sterilizations to 15- year-old girls even if the parents of those girls do not consent to the procedure. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius finalized the regulation earlier this year. It says that all health care plans in the United States--except those provided by actual houses of worship organized under the section of the Internal Revenue Code reserved for churches per se--must provide coverage, without cost-sharing, for sterilizations and all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptives to all women with reproductive capacity. In practical terms, ""all women with reproductive capacity"" means girls as young as about 12. That, according to the National Institutes of Health, is when girls usually start menstruating. When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act--a.k.a. Obamacare--was enacted in March 2010 it included (in Section 2713) a non-specific requirement that health care plans must provide ""additional preventive services"" to women. These unspecified ""additional preventive services,"" the law said, were to be ""provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration,"" a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. In developing the regulation to define these ""additional preventive services,"" HHS commissioned a federally funded committee at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to recommend what they should to be. In July 2011, this committee issued a report that said: The committee recommends for consideration as a preventive service for women: the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for women with reproductive capacity. White House staff toast Obama on the Truman Balcony early on March 22, 2010, after PPACA had passed Congress. (White House Photo/Pete Souza) The committee report said that with reproductive capacity meant from the time of menarche to menopause. Menarche is the beginning of menstruation--again, on average, about the age of 12 for American women. (Download the report for free here.) On Aug. 1, 2011, HHS announced that it was adopting the IOM committee's recommendation almost verbatim. In fact, it added just one word--placing ""all"" in front of ""women with reproductive capacity."" Thus, the regulation issued by the Health Resources and Services Administration said: ""Non-grandfathered plans and issuers are required to provide coverage without cost-sharing consistent with these guidelines in the first plan year (in the individual market, policy year) that begins on or after August 1, 2012. ... All Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity."" HHS said nothing about restricting the provision of these free ""preventive services"" to women who were 18 or older, or 21 or older, or even 15 or older. The regulation simply said ""all women with reproductive capacity."" However, states have varying laws on the age of consent. CNSNews.com took a look at Oregon and its rule of consent for sterilization--one of the free services required by the Obama administration's regulation. President Barack Obama fist pumps with a health-care professional at the White House on March 3, 2010. (White House Photo/Pete Souza) In Oregon, the age of informed consent is 15, and the law and rules on sterilization are detailed in the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) 436.205 to 436.335. Under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not. The parents or guardians of a minor girl--between 15 and 18--can neither grant nor deny consent for a sterilization. The Oregon law says: ""'Informed consent' means consent given by an individual 15 years of age or older for sterilization that is: (a) Based upon a full understanding of the nature and consequences of sterilization pursuant to information requirements set forth in ORS 436.225(1); (b) Given by an individual competent to make such a decision; and (c) Wholly voluntary and free from coercion, express or implied."" Oregon defines ""sterilization"" as ""any medical procedure, treatment or operation for the purpose of rendering an individual permanently incapable of procreating."" The Oregon Health Authority has created a special consent form called ""Ages 15-20 Consent to Sterilization."" ""When I first asked for the information, I was told that the decision to be sterilized is completely up to me,"" says this Oregon form for 15-year-old children. ""I was told that I could decide not to be sterilized."" ""I understand that the sterilization must be considered permanent and not reversible,"" says this consent form. ""I have decided that I do not want to become pregnant, bear children or father children."" The consent form even includes a section that can be signed by an interpreter, in case a 15-year-old child being sterilized by their own consent in Oregon is incapable of understanding English. This section says: ""If an interpreter is provided to assist the individual to be sterilized: I have translated the information and advice presented orally to the individual to be sterilized by the person obtaining this consent."" After specifying what language the interpreter used to explain the sterilization to the child, the form asks the interpreter to stipulate: ""To the best of my knowledge and belief he/she understood this explanation."" Additionally, the Oregon government makes the consent form available in Spanish--""15-20 anos Consentimiento para esterilizacion."" CNSNews.com specifically asked the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) by e-mail, What is the legal age of consent to sterilization in Oregon? The OHA media contact, Christine Stone, replied, In Oregon, the legal age for consent for sterilization is 15 years. Because the provision for coverage of sterilization under Obamacare applies to all women of reproductive capacity, which means girls younger than 15, CNSNews.com followed up with the OHA, asking, What is the rule regarding 12-, 13-, and 14-year-old girls who want to be sterilized? Stone said she could not provide any information other than what is cited in the Oregon statute. However, a handbook published by Disabilty Rights Oregon states that the law governing sterilization prohibits the sterilization of children younger than 15, and mandates that a parent, guardian or conservator may not give consent for sterilization of a minor child or protected person. The law allows a person who is 15 or older to consent to be sterilized. But if a person is not capable of giving informed consent, sterilization cannot proceed until age 18, and then only in limited circumstances as determined by court order. (Handbook: DRO-Sterilization_Handbook(2).pdf) CNSNew.som also contacted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and asked, Can you confirm that under this regulation a girl as young as 12 must be offered the opportunity to obtain a sterilization free of charge? In addition, CNSNews.com asked the HHS, In Oregon, the age of consent for a sterilization procedure is 15 years or older. Can you confirm that under this regulation, a 15-year-old girl can obtain a sterilization free of charge? After following up with multiple phone calls and e-mails, CNSNews.com was told by the HHS office of the secretary that there was no one available to answer these questions. At a pen-and-pad meeting with reporters in late March at the U.S. Capitol, CNSNews.com asked House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), The administration has approved a regulation under Obamacare that says, quote, all women with reproductive capacity, end quote, must be offered free sterilization-- Hoyer then interrupted, saying, How is that related to a pre-existing condition? CNSNews.com continued, --hold on--free sterilization in their health care plans. Do you support the mandate for free sterilization for college-age women? Hoyer expressed surprise, stating, Free sterilization? I dont know anything about free sterilization. I dont know anything about that. Im sorry. The answer is, I dont. But I dont think anybody is proposing that. At a press conference in mid-July, which specifically focused on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), CNSNews.com attempted to ask House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) whether she supported the HHS regulation insofar as it extends to teens and college-age women. Pelosi, however, cut the question off before it could be completed. If the player does not load, please check that you are running the latest version of Adobe Flash Player. CNSNews.com asked Pelosi, You mentioned the preventive services mandate. One of the services that health care plans have to offer free of charge are sterilizations. And I was wondering do you agree with the federal government mandating Pelosi said: You know what, I told you before, lets go to church and talk about our religion"" CNSNews.com asked: No, no, but its"" Pelosi said: Right here were talking about public policy as it affects women and were not, you know that this bill is"" CNSNews.com asked: No, it has nothing to do with the religious views but do you"" Pelosi said: No, it does.

In another instance on Capitol Hill, CNSNews.com asked Pelosi, ""Do you support the regulation taking affect August 1 requiring all health plans to cover free sterilizations for teenage girls?"" Pelosi said, ""I don't subsribe to your characterization of it,"" and then moved on to ther questions. If the player does not load, please check that you are running the latest version of Adobe Flash Player. Also, in late July, CNSNews.com asked Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), The HHS preventive services mandate requires all health plans to offer free sterilizations, including to girls in their teens. Do you support the mandate as it applies to teens? At that point, Rep. Schakowsky started to walk away without answering but, while walking, she said, I dont--Im unaware that it says that sterilization including teens is in that. Ill check that out. I will check that out, she said. CNSNews.com then followed up, It says all women of reproductive capacity, and it defines it as from menarche to menopause. Ill check that out, she said. Edwin Black, author of War Against the Weak: Eugenics and Americas Campaign to Create a Master Race, told CNSnews.com: I find it abhorrent that a 15-year-old girl who is not old enough to consent to sexual activity, who is not old enough to consent to buying a beer, who is not old enough to drive herself to the hospital could possibly be considered old enough and mature enough to give informed consent for her own sterilization. And the most vulnerable of these girls will be those who are wards of the state who are presented a piece of paper and told sign here, as they were in Virginia and California. Right now, when our country is considering compensation, such as in North Carolina for sterilization victims [and] states are hopping on the bandwagon to issue formal apologies  is not the time to reverse years of awareness and dive back into state-sponsored sterilization, said Black. The decades of genocidal sterilization are filled with numerous examples of fake consent forms being executed by young women who were being pressured by the state into sterilization. The IOM committee that recommended mandating coverage for free sterilizations to all ""women with reproductive capacity"" specifically argued that getting rid of cost-sharing requirements would lift a major barrier to what it considered more effective, long-lasting methods of contraception such as sterilization. In a study of the cost-effectiveness of specific contraceptive methods, all contraceptive methods were found to be more cost-effective than no method, and the most cost-effective methods were long-acting contraceptives that do not rely on user compliance,"" said the IOM committee's report. ""The most common contraceptive methods used in the United States are the oral contraceptive pill and female sterilization,"" said the report. ""It is thought that greater use of long-acting, reversible contraceptive methodsincluding intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants that require less action by the woman and therefore have lower use failure ratesmight help further reduce unintended pregnancy rates. Cost barriers to use of the most effective contraceptive methods are important because long-acting, reversible contraceptive methods and sterilization have high up-front costs. ""The elimination of cost sharing for contraception therefore could greatly increase its use, including use of the more effective and longer-acting methods, especially among poor and low-income women most at risk for unintended pregnancy,"" said this report recommending free sterilization coverage for all women who could conceive a child. ""A recent study conducted by Kaiser Permanente found that when out-of-pocket costs for contraceptives were eliminated or reduced, women were more likely to rely on more effective long-acting contraceptive methods,"" said the report."
http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2013/aug/24/doug-whitsett/was-oregon-legislature-within-one-vote-enacting-fi/,"More than a dozen bills relating to firearms were introduced during the recently concluded 77th Legislative Assembly. Most of those bills would have, in some way, impinged upon our second amendment right to own and bear firearms. A few of the more aggressive bills included:  House Bill 3200 that would have created the crime of unlawful possession or transfer of an assault weapon or large capacity magazine, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, or both.  House Bill 3413 that would have created the crime of endangering a minor, by allowing the minor access to a fire arm, punishable by up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both.  SB 347 that would have allowed each school district to establish their own rules regarding the right to carry a licensed concealed weapon on school property. Violation of the law would have constituted criminal trespass, resulting in penalties of up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both. This bill would also have preempted the current law that only allows the legislative body to create laws regulating firearms.  SB 699 that would have restricted the right to carry a concealed weapon in the capitol building by most licensed people without the written permission of the legislative administration.  SB 700 that would have required completion of a background check, before any firearm could be transferred between private parties. Failure to complete the background check could have resulted in penalties up to 5 years in prison, fines up to $125,000, or both.  SB 758 that would have required the owner of a firearm to carry specific liability insurance on each firearm in their possession. It also made it a crime to transfer a firearm to another person unless that individual carried liability insurance on the weapon. Failure to maintain liability insurance on each firearm would have resulted in fines of up to $10,000 per firearm.  SB 796 that would have required completion of a concealed handgun course, including a live fire test, before a concealed handgun license could be issued. It is unclear why our legislature should focus its attention on increasing the requirements to obtain a concealed carry permit. It seems that no one can remember the last time that an Oregon handgun licensee committed a crime with a firearm. Each of these bills, except HB 3413, had an emergency clause attached. The only reason for the emergency clause would have been to prevent the bill from being referred to the people to decide. None of these bills were enacted into Oregon law. The primary reason that the bills did not pass was because the Senate Leadership knew that the combined 15 no votes of 14 Senate Republicans, and of Senator Betsy Johnson, would have defeated each of the bills on the Senate floor. For that reason, they were never allowed to come to the Senate floor for a vote. From my perspective, that vote count is much too close for comfort. Your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law. It was within one vote of grossly impinging on our second amendment rights. Unfortunately, too many people are simply unaware of the facts regarding the possession of guns, and the commission of gun related crimes. In fact, most families have been convinced by media reports that gun related crimes are on the increase in America. That simply is not true! Over the past twenty years, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States has decreased by nearly 40 percent. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has also plummeted, declining by nearly 70 percent. Unintended deaths by firearms have dropped by nearly 60 percent since 1993, and have decreased by more than 80 percent since 1929. This dramatic decline in the number of crimes committed with firearms has occurred during the same time period when our national population has increased from 250 million to 315 million people. During the same twenty years, more than 100 million guns have been sold to private citizens in the United States. Forty three percent of U.S homes now report that they possess one or more firearms. I would imagine that the gun owning percentage is actually much higher than reported, because many people who own firearms do not prefer to let anyone know that they have those weapons. All indicators point to the fact that our society becomes safer as more responsible families own guns. Nonetheless, gun violence is the third most often reported event by our news media. That rate of reporting is only surpassed by news reports on traffic and the weather. The media almost never reports the daily events where violence is prevented by an armed citizen. It is this constant media bias that is primarily responsible for people believing that gun violence is on the increase. In my opinion, our most important right, as citizens of the United States, is our constitutionally guaranteed Second Amendment right to own and bear firearms. Throughout recorded history, each and every would-be dictator and despot has first convinced the people to disarm, allegedly in order to make their society a safer and more peaceful place to live. Once they have given up their firearms they have been systematically stripped of all other human rights. We must not allow glib-speaking politicians, and a complicit news media, to convince us that we are safer without firearms. We are not safer. We are defenseless.

http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2013/dec/03/carla-axtman/have-senate-republicans-filibusted-every-nominee-e/,"In a move that has sent conservatives to the fainting couch to wallow in their own schadenfreude, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid finally, finally, decided that it was time to do what Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley has been saying for years: tweak the rules of the filibuster to end minority blocking of non-Supreme Court judicial nominees and executive nominees.

That's the only change, incidentally. Republicans can still continue to block EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF LEGISLATION and they can still block the President's nominees to the Supreme Court. This is only for non-Supreme Court judicial nominees and other executive branch nominees. This small move has left the Republicans in line for smelling salts and stoked up outrage.

The Senate has been in a grind for a very long time, but the worst of it has come in the last five years where Senate Republicans have placed a filibuster on every piece of legislation and every nominee. The body was for all practical terms in paralysis, requiring a 60 vote majority to do anything.

Dave Weigel, Slate:

We do know how the Senate came to change its rules today, a vote that represented the biggest victory for the left since the election of President Barack Obama. That process started in the first weeks of 2009, after a Democratic landslide mighty enough to sweep even Al Franken into the upper house. The Republicans, who’d held 55 seats during the 2005 “nuclear option” fight, were down to 41. A new class of Democrats, including Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall, buckled in for action.

They got a slog. An economic stimulus package, once expected to get up to 80 votes, got over the 60-vote cloture line only with huge concessions to three Republicans. A simple omnibus parks funding bill took weeks to pass. Then, in May, just enough Republicans held together to filibuster the president’s nominee for deputy secretary of the Interior. To Majority Leader Harry Reid’s surprise, the Democratic left honed in quickly on the filibuster, demanding that he change it.

But Reid wasn't having it. He was a true believer in the rules of the Senate, wanting to forge moderation and consensus. All the while, the GOP kept right on filibustering. Not just some of the time. ALL of the time. Every move in the Senate required a 60 vote majority to do anything.

More Wiegel:

In May 2012, Republicans blocked an attempt to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. Reid responded with an apology to progressives. “If there were ever a time when Tom Udall and Jeff Merkley were prophetic, it’s tonight,” he said. “These two young, fine senators said it was time to change the rules of the Senate, and we didn’t. And they were right. The rest of us were wrong—or most of us, anyway. What a shame.”

In retrospect, that was the moment progressives brought their party on board with the biggest majority-rule congressional reform since the 1970s. Every one of Reid’s procedural moves since then has broken the minority’s power to obstruct legislation. This wasn’t just a case of broken trust between Democrats and Republicans—though that was part of it. This was a victory for a movement that believes its greatest threat comes from unfriendly courts and minority obstruction.

Certainly Senator Udall has been an important and leading voice on making this change. But the real champion for tweaking this rule? Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley.

Sahil Kapur, Talking Points Memo:

Nobody in the U.S. Senate has been more a more outspoken advocate for filibuster reform than Jeff Merkley. The Oregon Democrat was first elected senator on the same night that Barack Obama was first elected president, and quickly witnessed the chamber ""go from being a cooling saucer to being a deep-freeze,"" as he puts it, with unprecedented gridlock.

This change has truly sent Republicans off the deep end. Yesterday on Facebook, Oregonian contributing columnist, conservative Brendan Monaghan left a number of comments on my Facebook feed, but this one seems to sum it up best:

I don't believe changing the rules because you can't always get your way qualifies as believing in process and government. All I'm saying is, recognize what you've done. Recognize this is the arrogance of power, the delusion of your own invincibility. Some day, you may find yourself in the minority, unable to use the Senate as the saucer that cools the Tea.

This is the delusion that Republicans are stewing themselves in right now. Brendan is relatively moderate compared to most of his media counterparts, yet has bought his party's bizarre rhetoric on this issue. It's a shame that Republicans have decided that it's more important to pretend that bipartisanship is simply them getting their way all the time instead of having to actually concede some stuff to the Democrats. That's what this boils down to.

Interestingly, I've spoken a number of times to Merkley about the idea of the Democrats losing the majority and how any filibuster changes would impact the minority. Merkley has been very confident that any of the changes he's proposed would continue to allow the minority their power to wield obstruction. In fact, Merkley has never proposed an elimination of the filibuster procedure. Merkley's real goal for filibuster reform is the ""talking filibuster"", requiring the move to be the ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" style talk which would force the persons obstructing to stand up and actually defend what they're doing. This retains the minority's power to block when necessary, but they have to put their back into it instead of simply blocking as a matter of course.

And it's about time we get that rule on the books, too."
http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2013/jun/15/oregon-republican-party/do-illegal-aliens-cost-oregon-1-billion-year/,"All Oregonians who believe in the rule of law should be outraged by the recent passage of Senate Bill 833, providing a 4-year Oregon Driver Privilege Card for illegal aliens. Oregon Democratic Senators and Representatives voted unanimously in favor. Governor Kitzhaber signed SB833 into law at a May Day Rally on the Capitol steps.

Representatives Kim Thatcher (R-Keizer) and Sal Esquivel (R-Medford), and Oregonians for Immigration Reform Vice-President Richard LaMountain have filed a Referendum.

If Protect Oregon Driver Licenses successfully collects 58,142 valid signatures within 90 days of the close of the 2013 legislative session, voters will decide whether granting Driver Privilege Cards to illegal aliens is a good or bad idea. The following facts are compelling:

Public Safety - The salient tool necessary for subversive terrorist acts is a valid state driver license. No wonder the 911 Commission recommended states secure driver licenses.
Voter Integrity - According to current Oregon law, non-citizens can easily vote in local and state elections. If Secretary of State Kate Brown is successful in passing Universal Voter Registration, illegal aliens will vote.
Taxpayer Cost - OFIR estimates that the annual cost to Oregon taxpayers for government services to illegal aliens, after any income tax revenue from them, is $1 Billion.
The Oregon Republican Party Platform supports enforcement of immigration laws and the security of US borders. Giving Driver Privilege Cards to individuals in our country illegally is in contradiction with this.

Time is short! If you are interested in signing the referendum allowing voters the opportunity to decide if this law is right for Oregon, you may receive a single line signature sheet at www.protectoregondl.org.

If you wish to support this important cause and help gather signatures, please contact Oregonians for Immigration Reform at ofir@oregonir.org and request a ten-line signature sheet packet."
http://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jun/07/pat-toomey/pat-toomeys-beef-supreme-court-pick-merrick-garlan/,"By Pat Toomey In 2009 and 2010, President Obama nominated two individuals who now sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. At the time, I was a Senate candidate, not a U.S. senator, but I felt an obligation to let voters know where I stood, and I did so in opinion pieces. I supported then-Judge Sonia Sotomayor's nomination. I noted that her 17-year record as a federal judge provided much guidance about her approach, including an admirable exercise of judicial restraint. While I expected to disagree with many of her rulings, I wrote that ""objective qualifications should matter more than ideology in the judicial confirmation process."" I still believe that, which is why Sen. Bob Casey and I have worked across the aisle to fill 16 vacancies on the federal bench in Pennsylvania. Only two states -- New York and California -- have had more federal judges confirmed during the same period. I opposed Elena Kagan's nomination. In contrast to Sotomayor, Kagan had no judicial experience whatsoever, and aspects of her academic writings and actions raised serious concerns about her impartiality and whether she had sufficient respect for constitutional limits on federal power. That brings us to the present nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. I met with Judge Garland for over an hour, earlier this week. He is a pleasant man with impressive legal training and experience. Two factors, however, weigh heavily against his confirmation. First, the balance of the Supreme Court is at stake, and we have an election right around the corner. With lifetime tenure, the next justice will determine the Court's balance for a generation. In that light, I believe it is sensible to allow the American people to participate in the choice of Justice Scalia's successor less than seven months from now. Second, areas of Judge Garland's record give me pause. Under our Constitution's system of checks and balances, federal courts play an essential role in limiting executive abuses of power. This is especially important under the current Administration, which has repeatedly exceeded its legal authority. For example, in recent years, overreaches by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have cost Pennsylvanians thousands of jobs, and dramatically raised costs for employers, thereby preventing the hiring and decreasing the wages of countless additional workers. All of this for practically zero environmental gains. Fortunately, federal courts have blocked some of these illegal actions, such as the EPA's attempt to impose massive regulations on landowners who have virtually any water on their property--including rainwater that has accumulated in ditches. But Judge Garland's record raises serious doubts that he would serve as an adequate, independent legal check on the EPA and other federal agencies. Garland has ruled on dozens of cases involving challenges to new EPA regulations, and has sided with the agency over 90% of the time. One of the handful of times Garland ruled against the EPA, he ruled that it was not regulating enough. Garland was the deciding vote to uphold the 2012 regulations of coal- and oil-fired power plants. Although the EPA predicted that the regulations would impose up to $2,400 in costs for every $1 of benefit, the agency stated that costs were irrelevant--a conclusion Garland upheld. Fortunately, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision authored by Justice Scalia, halted this rule. Had Judge Garland been on the Court instead of Justice Scalia, the rule would be in effect today, killing more jobs and doing more harm to Pennsylvania's economy. I tried to discuss these issues with Judge Garland, but he was often unresponsive--unwilling to discuss one of his own decisions, and refusing to opine on historic Supreme Court precedents. In short, he did nothing to alleviate my concerns. The stakes are too high for error, not only with the balance of the Supreme Court, but with the futures of Pennsylvania workers, farmers, and businesses. I also raised with Judge Garland his approach to terrorist detainee cases. He authored an opinion that resulted in the release of 17 Guantanamo Bay prisoners who were part of a group of violent Islamist extremists the State Department had designated as terrorists. They were captured after fleeing an Afghanistan training camp funded by al Qaeda and the Taliban. Judge Garland overruled a military tribunal's unanimous finding that these detainees were enemy combatants. He second-guessed the military finding, contrary to federal statute. And his conclusion left the military with the choice of either jeopardizing the safety of intelligence informants or releasing enemy combatants. As a result of Garland's decision, the detainees were ordered released into the United States. Fortunately, another panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit halted this, and the detainees were instead released into other countries. In our discussion, Judge Garland again did not allay my concerns. In an era in which terrorists are actively using every weapon at their disposal to kill innocent Americans, we cannot afford to appoint a Supreme Court justice who fails to understand these dangers. In sum, while Judge Garland is highly credentialed, areas of his legal thinking deeply concern me, particularly his excessive deference to overreaching agency regulations and his approach to the War on Terror. These concerns, in addition to my preference for giving the American people a voice in November about the long-term balance of the Court, lead me to oppose his nomination at this time.

http://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jun/14/tom-mccarey/radar-guns-and-cameras-dont-stop-accidents-huh/,"On Wednesday, an organization called the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia will hold a rally at the state Capitol.

There, they will  try to exploit the  death of Jamal Morris, a bicyclist killed by a hit-and-run driver. 

In unfairly turning  this tragedy into an indictment of all drivers, they will call for red-light cameras, speed cameras , and  arming municipal police with  radar.

None of this would have stopped a cyclist from being hit,  and this technology makes highways more dangerous.

The Harrisburg politicians will respond favorably to this tripe, because they have been working hard  to install automated traffic enforcement statewide for a long time, seeking  the millions of dollars it funnels into government, stolen from safe drivers.

The bicycle coalition benefits from grant  money provided by  the Automated Red Light Enforcement Transportation Enhancement (ARLE) grants which uses the revenue generated by the Philadelphia's red light cameras for  bicycle projects in the city. This is a clear conflict of interest for the coalition.

No wonder  they want red light cameras, speed cameras and radar everywhere.

This will generate more grant for the bicycle coalition's projects. That they get grant money is in Philly city documents and ARLE project listings and is easy to confirm.

Cyclists who have problems with traffic don't know how to ride a bike.

Bicycles are vehicles, and bicyclists are charged  with all the duties and responsibilities of  operating a vehicle.


The problem is, they don't see it that way.  Incompetence behind the  handlebars  is the reason for close calls and accidents.

The bicycle coalition would have everyone believe that motorists are out to mow down every bike on the road. That is patently false.  Drivers mean business.  Cyclists should, too.

When motorists are frustrated with cyclists it's because they dart in and out of lanes, run stop signs and lights, and generally behave as if they own the road.

It's not a ride in the park, it's traffic!  They should be given training wheels and not allowed to ride unless their parents are walking beside them.

What the bicycle coalition wants is to rid the highways of cars, period.

Short of that they are demanding that the speed limit be reduced to a crawl, that driving lanes be reduced to accommodate defined bike lanes, that  red light cameras be installed at every intersection; that  speed cameras be installed everywhere, and that radar be given to local police.

In short, make driving  as  inconvenient and uncomfortable as possible.

Never mind that no red light camera, no speed camera, nor any radar gun has ever stopped one accident from occurring.

Enforcement of these types makes the highways more dangerous and only generates revenue for the government.  I'm sure that is the coalition's aim: so that there is more grant money to spend on bike projects.

The coalition insists that 100 percent of its manifesto be enacted.

They are unwilling to engage in any debate:  they might have their talking points refuted, and we can't have that.

If you post comments on their website that they do not like, then the posts are removed.

People who care about driving issues have tried to talk to the bike coalition. But they refuse any discussion.

The coalition admits that if red light and speed cameras and widespread RADAR were legal, they likely would have  no effect on preventing accidents or deaths.

Every time something happens, they blast  the media to blame drivers and call for draconian laws and stepped-up enforcement.

The BCGP needs a dose of reality. They need to wake up and realize that they are part of a minority who is trying to bully the rest of us into submission, and we don't want any part of it.

It was sold to the American people with multiple false promises, like President Barack Obama’s infamous, “If you like your health care plan, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.” Supporters of the law said it would reduce premiums for families by an average of $2,500 per year. It did not. One by one, Obamacare’s promises were broken. Now, premiums and deductibles continue to skyrocket with no mechanism in the law to bring prices down.

In Pennsylvania alone, workers and families are facing average premium increases of 33 percent. The list of insurers who have left the Obamacare exchanges altogether because they can no longer afford to offer plans is growing. Eighteen of the 23 Obamacare-created Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans (Co-Ops) across the country have collapsed — after taxpayers were forced to waste $2 billion to keep them operational. Instead of a robust insurance marketplace, Obamacare is building a monopoly that all but guarantees costs will continue to rise.

Still, supporters claim this bill has fixed a once-broken health care system. In reality, Obamacare covers 24 million fewer people than it was expected to, and the projected price tag has more than doubled at $2 trillion. This simply cannot be defined as success. Those Americans who did sign up for health care through Obamacare did so under the threat of financial penalties from the federal government. The large majority of newly insured were pushed into Medicaid, a broken insurance program that has historically failed our most vulnerable populations. Not only does this seriously limit consumer choice and quality of care for patients, but it also comes at a serious cost to the American taxpayer.

It’s time for change. We have no choice but to scrap this failed program and replace it with a system that gives Pennsylvanians access to the care they need, at a price they can afford and from a doctor they choose.

Our alternative will expand the options for individuals and families to access affordable insurance coverage. It will provide for a transition period where those currently on Obamacare will have ample time to choose a new plan that works best for them and their families. We will make sure that no one struggling with complex medical needs or pre-existing conditions is denied access to affordable health care options.

Our replacement will allow insurers to provide more options for consumers and allow individuals, small businesses and associations to pool together to get the same purchasing power as large entities. We will expand Health Savings Accounts; provide tax credits to help those who do not have employer-based coverage to buy their own insurance in an expanded private market; and ensure health care decisions are made between a patient and his or her doctor, not by bureaucrats in Washington. In short, our plan is to move away from Washington mandates and move toward flexibility and choice.

These are commonsense solutions.

While Obamacare has failed in an undeniable fashion, the goal of ensuring the American people can access quality, affordable health care remains. Our Democratic counterparts in Congress have spent the last eight years championing President Obama’s signature legislation — even as working families continued to lose the plans and doctors they like, and their health care costs continued to skyrocket.

Republicans have an urgent mandate to deliver relief to every family struggling under Obamacare. We must repeal this failed law and move ahead with putting a better plan in place for the American people.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/05/katie-pavlich/townhall-editor-claims-us-agency-empowered-itself-/,"Last week the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, through the power of Dodd-Frank, passed a rule giving the agency unprecedented power to shut down businesses, no matter what the reason, at any time it wishes through a cease-and-desist order. Further, the rule puts businesses at the mercy of the CFPB and they cannot go back into operation until government approval or a court ruling is made over an issue. Subsequently because bureaucratic decisions and court rulings take a substantial amount of time to happen, businesses cannot survive during those waiting periods. Here are the details (bolding is mine): In a notice published in todays Federal Register, the CFPB has announced that it has adopted its interim final rule on temporary cease-and-desist orders (C&Ds) without change. The final rule takes effect on July 18, 2014. The CFPB is authorized to issue temporary C&Ds under Section 1053(c) of Dodd-Frank. That provision authorizes a temporary C&D as an adjunct to a cease-and-desist proceeding brought under Section 1053 against a covered person or service provider. A temporary C&D is effective immediately upon service and remains in effect unless modified or terminated administratively by the CFPB or set aside on judicial review. The new rule comes on the heals of revelations the Department of Justice has been smothering firearms dealerships and other ""high risk"" entities out of business by ""choking"" banks and stripping funding through Operation Choke Point. Consumer groups are pushing back against the rule and issuing a warnings to businesses everywhere about what the rule means for them. The United States Consumer Coalition in particular is sounding the alarm: ""This unprecedented rule created by the CFPB grants the agency unilateral authority to literally shut down any business overnight. It is a doubling down of Operation Choke Point (OCP), the Administration's program to target lawful industries by intimidating banks from doing business with them. This rule allows the CFPB to immediately issue a cease-and-desist order, which terminates all business practices  and a hearing doesnt have to be granted for 10 days, effectively shutting down businesses for at least 10 days. This is a 'guilty until proven innocent' tactic of the Administration that goes against every historical notion of justice under the law in America."" ""The Administration got caught with their illegal intimidation tactics in Operation Choke Point, and now they are taking radical steps to ensure the goals of shutting down these lawful businesses are met. This is just the next step in using unaccountable agencies, with their ever-expanding agency powers, to meet the political goals of the Administration. This is a much more efficient way of shutting down lawful industries than just relying on intimidation. It is also no coincidence that this rule was released the day that CFPB Director Richard Cordray finished testifying at oversight hearings on the Hill."" ""This is a direct attack on every free-market business in America, and every single business should be alarmed. No business should have to operate while questioning daily whether or not they will be the victim of a cease-and-desist order. This will cause uncertainty on Wall Street and uncertainty in the job market, leading to a loss of jobs and devastating the families that rely on them, while irreversibly damaging the economy and threatening consumer choice."" I have no doubt a few Senators will have a few things to say about this.The rule can be opposed and overturned through legislation and oversight. ""The best solution would be to pass the CFPB reform bill that Rep. Duffy introduced adding bipartisan oversight to the Bureau through an appointed commission,"" USCC Senior Advisor Brian Wise says. ""Having a Director-led agency with this much authority puts too much control in the hands of one unelected man. Otherwise they could repeal Dodd-Frank but that isnt practical at this point.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/25/blog-posting/do-71-percent-obama-voters-regret-voting-him-2012-/,"(Washington Examiner)  Over seven in 10 Obama voters, and 55 percent of Democrats, regret voting for President Obamas reelection in 2012, according to a newEconomist/YouGov.com poll. Conducted to test the media hype about a comeback by 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, the new poll found voters still uninspired by Romney, but also deeply dissatisfied with Obama who has so far failed to capitalize on his victory over 15 months ago. The poll asked those who voted for Obamas reelection a simple question: Do you regret voting for Barack Obama? FAX BLAST SPECIAL: Impeach Obama NOW!  Overall, 71 percent said yes, 26 percent no.  80 percent of whites said yes, 61 percent of blacks said no and 100 percent of Hispanics said yes.  84 percent of women said yes, and just 61 percent of men agreed.  55 percent of Democrats said yes, as did 71 percent of independents. Still, given the choice of Obama versus Romney, Obama supporters said they would stick with their guy, 79 percent to 10 percent for Romney. But his voters seem to have moved on and are ready for the next election, giving Obama very early lame duck status before the midterm elections. The poll, for example, found that Hillary Clinton has a higher favorability rating than the president. While Obama is underwater in his ratings, Clinton is buoyed by a 50-percent favorable to 43-percent unfavorable rating, with a sizable 28 percent rating her very favorable. As for Romney, his favorable ratings have dropped, but he would edge Obama by about three million votes, probably because Americans are not wowed by Obamas second term performance, not because they like Romney more. Said the poll: In YouGov research conducted from February 6th-7th, we went about it in a slightly different way, asking people who voted for Mitt Romney or Barack Obama whether they would do it again. We found an ostensibly similar picture: 90 percent of people who voted for Romney would do it again, compared to only 79 percent of Obama voters who would. Clearly Romney fares better, although he had fewer voters to begin with. As a proportion of the voters each of them actually received in 2012 (66 million for Obama and 61 million for Romney), the GOP candidate ends up with 55 million votes retained to Obamas 52 million. Not exactly a wipeout. Its also unclear for any poll that hypothetically revisits 2012 how much it says about renewed hope for Mitt Romney  who has notably been liberated from the scrutiny of a presidential campaign  rather than about dissatisfaction with an incumbent president who has spent the last year defending his administration over leaks, scandals and Obamacare roll-outs. _LINKS_"

Neither was the Obama administration's half-butted reaction on Tuesday. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced that to show our support for Poland and the Baltic states after Russia's intervention in Ukraine, the we will train more Polish pilots and expand our role in NATO's air policing mission over their territories. I'm sure Comrade Putin is quaking in his combat boots. To show he really meant business, Hagel went to the old Cold War playbook and pulled out some high-minded rhetoric about it being time ""for all of us to stand with the Ukrainian people in support of their territorial integrity and sovereignty."" That sounded real nice, Chuck. The trouble is, it's too late for Ukraine and its people. It's been too late for a long time. Unless we want to start World War III, Putin is going to do whatever he wants in the Crimea. It was only a matter of time before Putin took off his Olympic ski mask and cracked down on Ukraine's freedom movement the way his imperialist forefathers in the Kremlin would have during the Cold War. The United States has been showing Putin how little we care about what he does to the citizens of the former Soviet Union since 2008. After Putin's quick intervention in Georgia - Mikhail Gorbachev's former Soviet Georgia, not Jimmy Carter's Georgia -- the Bush administration pretended it was going to do something really tough. Dick Cheney rattled a few sabers and said Putin's use of military force to snuff out Georgia's freely elected pro-Western government would not go unanswered. If Putin didn't give Georgia back its autonomy, Cheney warned, there'd be serious consequences for Russia's relations with the United States. Of course, nothing happened. Russia did what it wanted and the Free World moved on. Georgia is an occupied country today, just as Ukraine will be one tomorrow. The Obama administration has been soft on putinism too. In 2009 the president's team cancelled the missile defense system the United States had been planning to set up in Poland and the Czech Republic. We wanted to protect Europe from Iranian missile strikes, but Putin thought we were disrespecting him and threatening his Mother Russia. He put up a fuss and we caved, again showing Putin how tough we really weren't. The Obama administration can't - and shouldn't - do anything militarily about Ukraine. But it can do more than just talk tough and cancel some military exercises with Russia. I suggest that President Obama might want to study how Ronald Reagan defeated the Soviet Union. He did it without firing a shot, as we know, but he had a super weapon - oil. Oil was the only thing the Soviets had in the 1980s that anyone in the rest of the world wanted to buy, besides ICBMs and H-bombs, and they weren't for sale. Since selling oil was the source of the Kremlin's wealth, my father got the Saudis to flood the market with cheap oil. Lower oil prices devalued the ruble, causing the USSR to go bankrupt, which led to perestroika and Mikhail Gorbachev and the collapse of the Soviet Empire. The Soviet Union was so destitute, so unable to pay for anything from the West in the 1980s, it was pathetic. ""How bad was it?"" I once asked Mr. Gorbachev at a town meeting. He said his country was so broke its women couldn't get pantyhose. The women of the USSR were so livid, Gorbachev said, he was forced to appoint a Czar of Pantyhose to bring pantyhose into the country. My father had powerful allies on his team - Maggie Thatcher, Pope John Paul II, Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa. All poor Obama has is the UK's David Cameron. But if our president is really serious about getting Putin to lay off Ukraine and think twice about rebuilding the Soviet Empire, he should follow the Reagan Rule. He should put the economic screws to Mother Russia and bankrupt her until she starts clamoring for pantyhose."

In an appearance on CBSs Sunday Morning, the Million Reasons singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. Im very acutely aware that once I cross that property line Im not free anymore, Gaga said. Its like Im stepping out into this entirely different world where everybodys allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I cant even call the police to help me because theyre not doing anything wrong, the singer complained.

And to top it all off  weve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well. Asked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasnt her first choice, as well as that he couldnt have picked a worse time to become President of the United States, due to the fact that I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House. It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I havent been able to do that in a long time, she revealed. So, Im sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but Im afraid Im going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever Im out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well, the singer revealed. At this point Im not sure whether thats going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask thatll cover my face, but what I do know is thats the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. Im too good looking to be changing my face at this age. Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybodys life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where Im able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, Ill be going back to wearing a mask.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/14/blog-posting/websites-revive-claim-house-democrats-strike-impos/,"While we were busy celebrating the Christmas holiday, House Democrats introduced a dangerous resolution that threatens to strip us of basic rights in our nations first major step towards Sharia law. On December 17, Democrat Congressmen quietly sponsored House Resolution 569, a resolution that asks lawmakers to condemn violence, bigotry, and hateful rhetoric towards Muslims in the United States. The resolution specifically mentions Muslims, no other religious groups, and will serve as a test by which further criminalizing of Islamophobia may be introduced. Democrats have shamelessly lumped together hate speech with violence in an effort to compare criticism of Islam to physically harming Muslims. H. Res. 569 threatens to restrict our right to even report facts that tarnish Islams reputation, a law that all Sharia-governed countries already have in place. According to Congress.gov, the resolution reads: Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the House of Representatives denounces in the strongest terms the increase of hate speech, intimidation, violence, vandalism, arson, and other hate crimes targeted against mosques, Muslims, or those perceived to be Muslim; urges local and Federal law enforcement authorities to work to prevent hate crimes; and to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law those perpetrators of hate crimes Muslims are slaughtering innocent people more than any other religious groups combined, all while refusing as a whole to condemn this barbaric Islamic terrorism, yet we are working to ensure these silent, consenting moderates have special protection  protection that they have never allowed religious minorities in their own countries. In another passage, Democrats laughably purport that Muslims have contributed to the fabric of American society, but were assuming they dont mean terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, countless frivolous CAIR lawsuits, whitewashed Islamic education in public schools, or whining about pork products and a lack of taxpayer-funded prayer rooms. Whereas this Muslim community is recognized as having made innumerable contributions to the cultural and economic fabric and well-being of United States society Still, the bill is purposefully vague in that it mentions prosecuting the perpetrators of hate speech, yet gives no definition for what it considers hate speech. Of course, we who have spoken out about the intolerant fundamentals of Islam understand that this means uttering anything critical of Islam or its followers, regardless of facts or relevance to the Quran. In conclusion, the bill ridiculously compares criticizing Islam as a violation of Muslims civil rights, as if disagreeing or even openly mocking someones beliefs is unconstitutional. Our forefathers had exactly political and religious mockery in mind when they penned our amendments, having experience the violation of limited speech and worship by their own King George III. Indeed, free speech was never intended to defend inoffensive speech, because inoffensive speech needs no protection. Freedom of speech is solely for the offensive, meant to prevent those who would limit it because of their opposing beliefs. We are witnessing the very implementation of Sharia law as it has always been established in every modern-day Islamic country. Of course they wouldnt start by legalizing the execution of homosexuals or mandating the hijab for every woman, because we wouldnt accept being forced to adopt full Sharia right off the bat. You cant cook a frog by placing him in scalding water  hell jump out. However, you can slowly increase the temperature until he is boiling before he ever knew the water was uncomfortable. Once weve lost our freedom of speech, all our other freedoms will follow suit. This is well-known and intended by the Muslim community, the majority of whom admit to wanting Sharia law. The only way to stop them from infringing upon our speech is to use it. Now more than ever, we must speak out against this stealth jihad and fascism that seeks to overthrow our Constitution for a religious and political legislature, lest we substitute one tyrant of old for new ones.

American Action Forum reported that America has just passed an important milestone  the 10-year regulatory burden on Americans has now passed $1 trillion. New Environmental Protection Agency regulations on trucks were what finally pushed the regulation costs over $1 trillion. Put another way, each American now will have to fork over a one-time payment of $3,080 for these new regulations, or an annual cost of about $540. Thanks, Obama! TRENDING: During 3-on-1 Gang Attack, Cop Unleashes K9 Who Instantly Evens the Odds These payments could come in any number of ways, such as fewer jobs and higher taxes  pretty much all of the negatives associated with having a bloated and corrupt federal government. As if that wasnt bad enough, thanks to all these new regulations, the estimated number of hours for all the paperwork is 754,208,700 hours, according to the report. There are 8,760 hours in a year, so the paperwork for these regulations would only take roughly 86,097 years for one person to complete  or, more realistically, the paperwork would require over 377,000 people working full-time at 2,000 hours per week to process. None of their work will add any value to the U.S. economy. And Obama is probably going to try to push through more regulations before he leaves office. Can we make the lives of Americans even more miserable before Obama moves out of the White House? Yes, we can! This is exactly why the Founders wanted to keep the size of government small. Trump promised during the campaign, and it was posted on his website, that he would cut back federal regulations drastically. We cant afford this much regulation. While there is no arguing that some regulation is a necessary evil, the federal government has gone completely off the rails with the number of regulations being enacted, almost all of them by un-elected career bureaucrats. Its time to cut back these regulations, ease the financial burden on taxpayers and let the economy grow once again. Trump better follow through on his promises  or else America is in serious trouble.

Marshall also points out that the Republicans current bill screws any and all folks who have been paying into the system for decades. your payroll taxes have been socking away additional money to cover the growing senior population. But this bill says too bad. That money goes for high income tax cuts. In other words, screw hard working Americans who paid into the system their whole lives, because the wealthy need more tax breaks. Also, keep in mind that current Social Security cap is $118,500. Meaning you pay on all your income up to that amount, which, for most Americans, is all their income. The wealthy, on the other hand, get the lovely gift of not needing to pay after that amount. They literally get to keep all of their money while everyone else still pays. Imagine how solvent Social Security would be if the cap was raised to say $1 million, or hell, eliminated altogether. According to the Washington Examiner, the Republicans new bill: would reduce costs by changing the benefits formula to reduce payments progressively for high earners. It would also gradually raise the full retirement age from 67 to 69 for people who are today 49 or younger. Lastly, it would change the inflation metric used to calculate benefits to one that shows lower inflation, essentially slowing the growth in benefits, and eliminate cost of living adjustments for high earners. Democrats have released the following statement in response: Apparently nothing upsets House Republicans like the idea of hard-working people getting to enjoy a secure and dignified retirement. While Speaker Ryan sharpens his knives for Medicare, Chairman Johnsons bill is an alarming sign that Republicans are greedily eying devastating cuts to Americans Social Security benefits as well. Cutting Social Security would have devastating consequences for Americans retirement security. At a time when Americans are more anxious about their retirement than ever, the top Republican on the Social Security Subcommittee is rolling out legislation that cuts benefits by more than a third, raises the retirement age from 67 to 69, cuts seniors cost of living adjustments, and targets benefits for the families of disabled and retired workers. Slashing Social Security and ending Medicare are absolutely not what the American people voted for in November. Democrats will not stand by while Republicans dismantle the promise of a healthy and dignified retirement for working people in America. Its incredibly sad that Republican Middle and Working class voters, alongside the working poor dont understand how they vote against their best interests. Voting Republican is voting for the wealthy to not pay their fair share while everyone else picks up the tab. They want to know why economic growth is slow? How can it grow if lower income people cant keep their money? The economy doesnt grow from the top down, or even the bottom up, it grows from the middle out. Everyone benefits if everyone participates. And its not even that Republicans in Congress have yet to learn this, they know very well how things work, they just know how to manipulate the system to their advantage and only care about themselves and their cronies that fund their campaigns. We need to put a stop to these cuts now! Heres the bill:"
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/15/bipartisan-report/florida-calls-recount-over-voter-fraud-website-say/,"According to a lawsuit filed Monday in Leon Circuit Court, it was Hillary Clinton who won the state of Florida, not Donald Trump. In an attempt to overturn the election results, Floridians have filed a motion for a recount in their state.

According to the Detroit Free Press, “hacking, malfunctioning voting machines, and other problems” are sole the reason Hillary Clinton lost that day.

The voters are asking for a recount of every ballot submitted in the state of Florida. The defendants listed in the lawsuit are “Trump, Gov. Rick Scott and the 29 Republican presidential electors from Florida.” The lawsuit also asks that the defendants pay for the total cost of the recount.

Clint Curtis is an attorney representing the plaintiffs. He says that, while the chances would ordinarily be slim to none, with a candidate like Donald Trump, there is no way of knowing:

“He’s mentioned he wants to fix the rigged system. This will give the opportunity to do that. If it were a normal politician, I’d say our chances are very slim. But it’s not a normal politician — it’s Donald Trump.”

Curtis says that the defendants likely will not even respond to the motion before the Dec. 29 deadline, or that “they can ignore it entirely.”

The Orlando attorney says that he has received multiple reports of malfunctions on election day, and that it is entirely possible that Donald Trump did not really win Florida.

Trump has come out against the motions for recounts in multiple states set forth by Jill Stein, but has not yet publicly addressed this newest lawsuit.

Three years after Foxs Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors. Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the companys actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and running Mall of America into the ground, on the basis of Santa always having been white in the Bible. No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong, Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was the last straw in corporate Americas twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, because they realized they couldnt make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques theyve been using so far. She added, Thats why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they wont shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I dont understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that. Thats why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again, Palin added. The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we dont, if we let them get away with it, whats next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, were going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think thats happening by accident? Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning, she concluded."

Liberal rag Huffington Post is really running with this story from The Washington Post about the CIA “confirming” Russian interference in the presidential election.

They’re saying if 100% true, the courts can PUT HILLARY IN THE WHITE HOUSE!

Scary!

From HuffPo:

A 1995 federal court ruling out of Pennsylvania may offer some clues to Clinton supporters as to possible legal authority for removing an elected official from office and replacing them with their erstwhile opponent.

In light of late-breaking reports Friday evening that Russians interfered with the 2016 presidential election to assist Donald Trump’s victory, Clinton supporters are furiously in pursuit of remedies.

At 10:45 p.m. Friday evening, the Washington Post broke an explosive story alleging that Russians had interfered with the 2016 presidential election in order to assist Donald Trump in a victory over democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.

The development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become “faithless” or “conscientious” electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.

The electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton’s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation’s highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.

Proponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

What a bunch of BS.

This will never happen!

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/27/newsexaminernet/fake-news-site-falsely-claims-obama-gay-muslim/,"Washington, DC — A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazon’s best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama.

Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book “The Black House,” reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off.

In an interview with NBC News, Horner told Senior Political Analyst Tom Downey that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Obama is not only gay, but a radical Muslim as well.

“Everyone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim, it is common knowledge,” Horner said. “I saw many men coming and going from Obama’s room, at all hours. I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim.”

Downey: “In your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our viewers?”

Horner: “When no one was around, except his security, Obama couldn’t wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed.”

 

Downey: “Your book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various “tortures” that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain?”

Horner: “Because I was white, Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross at full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep. This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit.”

Downey: “Can you give us any insight on Obama’s feelings towards the American people?”

Horner: “He constantly made jokes about Americans, frequently referring to them as “mongoloids” and “idiots”. Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags. He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion. I believe he actually hates Christians, and finds their ideology to be old fashioned and ignorant.”

Downey: “What are some of the things the public will find the most shocking?”

Horner: “Probably the sheer amount of men he welcomed into his bed quarters. I am in no way homophobic, but Obama’s insatiable lust for homosexual liaisons is like nothing I’ve ever witnessed. We’re talking 10-15 partners in a single day.”

Downey: “That’s amazing, 10-15 in a single day? Wow.”

Horner: “Also, at least once a day, Obama would have us log on to Facebook and report a page about a Dolphin named Fappy who travels around the country speaking to elementary school children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. It was all very, very strange stuff.”

Downey: “Is there anything else you can tell us?”

Horner: “Yeah (Horner smiles), buy the book.”

Google Trends recorded a huge spike in the number of people asking What happens if we leave the EU?, after the polls had closed (pictured) UNCERTAIN BRITS TAKE TO GOOGLE The analytics arm of Californian search giant Google recorded a huge spike in the numbers of Brits querying the fallout of yesterday's EU referendum vote. Google Trends recorded a spike in the number of people asking What happens if we leave the EU?, after the polls had closed. However, the search term was relatively flat in the week running up to the vote. Early this morning, the analytics arm of the search giant said it had seen a huge jump in the search term. However, analysis shows the question only started to rise as the polls were closing and had been relatively flat in the week running up to the vote. On Twitter, Google Trends wrote: +250 per cent spike in what happens if we leave the EU in the past hour. The search result is expected given the complex arrangement of the EU, with many keen to know how agreements affecting trade and the UK's commitments as a member state will be unpicked as the UK leaves. In the weeks and months running up to the vote, many criticised the deluge of information coming from the opposing camps, as well as industry leaders, economists, scientists and celebrities all voicing their support. At the start of the month, Conservative MP and 'vote leave' advocate Michael Gove said: 'I think people in this country have had enough of experts,' speaking in response to the claims of a expert consensus cited by the 'remain' campaign. The results of the referendum showed 51.9% of UK voters opted to leave the EU. But analysis of search trends in the run up to the vote provide an insight into widepsread confusion among voters Earlier this month, Google released data showing the terms Brits were searching for in the run up to the referendum, revealing immigration and NHS topping the list. The data, which covered searches over a seven day period from 31st May to 7th June, provided a glimpse into what concerned people across the UK most, but belied a sense of general confusion. +250% spike in ""what happens if we leave the EU"" in the past hour_LINKS_  GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) June 24, 2016 With so many conflicting points on such a complex issue, the data show many Brits are simply seeking a straight answer, searching for Why should we leave/stay in the EU?, followed closely by What will happen if?. Google Trends recorded a spike in activity in people searching for 'What happens if we leave the EU?' after the polls had closed But in the week leading up to the vote this activity was largely flat But the top question across the UK concerning the EU referendum is What is Brexit? referring to the term coined for Britain's exit from the EU. The initial fallout from the referendum has shown a drop in the value of Sterling, with more than 100 billion wiped from the FTSE 100 this morning as stock markets reacted to the result. Prime Minister David Cameron has also announced he will be stepping down following the defeat of the remain campaign. But beyond these initial events, it could take a while for the full scale of the UK's decision to become apparent. Earlier in the month, the top search terms were immigration, NHS, economy, sovereignty and national security. But the question most people across the UK were asking was What is Brexit?, referring to the term coined for Britain's exit from the EU (pictured) An interactive heat map of search terms in the run up to the referendum showed more people were searching for leave in built up metropolitan areas (pictured) Search analysis in the run up to the vote revealed that more people were searching for 'leave' in metropolitan areas, but rather than an indication of voter preference, it could have been explained by people searching for the more information into the potential impact of a British exit from the EU. The final count of the UK vote showed 72.2 per cent of the population cast their vote, with 51.9 per cent voting to leave the EU. A total of 48.1 per cent of voters opted to remain in the EU, with the greatest proportion in London, Scotland and Northern Ireland."

Megyn Kelly turned down a $20 million payday to stay with the only trusted name in news for a daytime slot where she could play a white version of Oprah Winfrey on NBC for 25 percent less money. Now that her tenure at Fox has ended and her new show is scheduled to start production sequences for a fall premiere, Kelly decided she wasn’t happy and demanded the format be changed.

 
According to Hugh McGovern, executive producer of Kelly’s new show:

“Megyn had high hopes when she left Fox that people would still take her seriously as a journalist. She was lured to NBC with promises of easier days and evenings at home with the family. Now that she sees the production schedule, she feels like she’s been duped and has demanded she be given more serious show assignments.”

The problem, according to McGovern, is that Kelly sees a schedule filled with visits from celebrities and novelists to talk about their sitcoms and books, traveling assignments to dog shows and fashion week and even the addition of a musical guest. According to Maxwell Seawald, CEO of NBC Universal:

“Ms. Kelly wants to be a journalist. Unfortunately, after her stint at Fox News and the way she attacked President Trump, she lost her following. Our data tells us that our audience will tolerate and even learn to like her, but not as a political pundit or someone they should take seriously. She needs to think less Diane Sawyer and more Kelly Ripa.”

Unfortunately, Kelly couldn’t do that and the whole thing came to a head this afternoon, causing NBC to pay a severance clause of $150K to cancel her contract. NBC spokesman Hugh Levitt told Fox News:

“Megyn Kelly was a superstar until she took on Trump. Now she’s a laughing stock. She could have worked a year or two and made herself $25 million. Instead she’ll spend her days looking for someone else who needs a washed up hasbeen from Fox News who knows nothing but how to piss people off.”

Sorry, Megyn. It’s not like we didn’t all see this coming. Hasta la vista, baby.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/03/blog-posting/vince-fosters-death-has-not-been-ruled-homicide-af/,"A string of events this week has led to incredible results in a 23-year-old case that had gone completely cold. After a reporter for The Washington Examiner was shot dead in front of his home and a letter was sent to his editor on his behalf, an investigation began into the death of Clinton attorney Vince Foster. Foster’s death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide.

With new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasn’t autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide.

LT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospital’s forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. There would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time. The wounds were also in the back of his head, meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time, the original story was impossible.

The doctor who signed Foster’s death certificate died in a car crash a few months later and the police detectives who worked the case have both left the country, never to be seen again. Without the letter from the reporter who was gunned down in Fairfax for no apparent reason, Mr. Foster may have never seen justice.

The case has been turned over to the FBI, who has clear jurisdiction at this point, for the difficult task of connecting the dots from Foster’s death directly to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Director Comey has assured the congressional panel that he will personally see to it that all of the bureau’s resources are made available.

In other words, Clinton will be getting away with murder…again."

Two United States Representatives were just arrested for plotting to carry out the assassination of President Trump. These aren’t some off-the-hook left wing extremists, they’re typical men with what seem like typical lives but liberalism has turned them insane with jealousy and rage.

Rep. Harold Spunkmeyer (D-Illinois) and Rep. Johnathon Leominster Jr (D-Massachusetts) were taken to a military holding facility under suspicion of terrorism for plotting to murder the President. Several of their closest aides as well as their families have also been detained. As we speak, a special unit of the Secret Service is closing the net on all of their friends and anyone else who could potentially cause harm to President Trump.

According to reports, intelligence was gathered from the men’s computers that they were planning to ambush the president during one of his trips to Florida, giving them 4 to 5 possible attack attempts per month to work with. It’s unclear where exactly the attacks would have taken place, but the agents in charge of the investigation say they are certain the men were serious about the plan:

“Their plans were hidden from plain sight in what they said was a ‘design for a new video game,’” said Special Agent George Ketterman, “While they never actually used the president’s name or purchased any of the items listed in the ‘game,’ like grappling hooks, stinger missiles, bulletproof jetskis or yellow cake uranium, there was enough evidence when presented to the president for him to order us to take them as terrorism suspects.”

In unrelated news, the men were known to be strong opponents of the Trump agenda and were also organizing massive protests and marches in their districts. ABC reports that between them they had raised more signatures opposing Trump’s executive orders on immigration and travel than any other lawmakers in Washington.

NBC News tried to reach out to the men’s lawyers to see if there would be a statement available but couldn’t find one. It would appear that the men, their families and whoever may have been stupid enough to represent them will just disappear as enemies of the state under the Patriot Act.

Welcome to Trump’s America, liberals. If you step out of line you’ll be removed altogether."
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/13/blog-posting/fake-news-story-falsely-quotes-kasich-saying-some-/,"Recently, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the so-called “heartbeat bill,” a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman’s life or preventing the “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”

“At the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,” Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. “Women are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I’m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.”

He continued, “Our mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there’s one very simple reason why I did it. That’s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.”

“A woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we’re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child – a being who’s done no wrong and only exists as its mother’s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?” Kasich said. “I don’t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.”

“And I’ll tell you another thing – as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn’t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,” the governor concluded.

The shooting of Harris County Precinct 3 Assistant Chief Deputy Clinton Greenwood did not appear to be random, according to Baytown police Lt. Steve Dorris, but a motive was not immediately clear.

“Whether or not he was specifically targeted, or whether this was because of the uniform he was wearing or the place he pulled up to in the morning, we just don’t know that right now,” Dorris said.

No arrests had been made as of Monday evening. Dorris said authorities were still “actively investigating” the shooting.

Investigators said late Monday they were looking for a suspect described as a white or Hispanic male, approximately 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 6-feet-3 inches tall, with short hair and a medium to stocky build. The man was described as possibly wearing a dark jacket with some type of patch on the sleeve and was seen in the area around the time of the shooting. Baytown police said the suspect might have fled the scene in a dark vehicle.

Greenwood, a 30-year law enforcement veteran, was shot outside a county courthouse building in Baytown, east of Houston. He suffered a single gunshot wound and was airlifted to a Houston hospital where he died."

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/21/blog-posting/fake-story-says-fox-news-host-sandra-smith-doubted/,"Fox News host Sandra Smith on Wednesday linked a customer who was dragged off a United Airlines flight to government “overregulation” of the airline industry. During a Fox News discussion about the recent United Airlines public relations debacle, Smith noted that lawmakers were calling for an investigation and that the airline lost millions in stock value. “Airlines disgust me,” Fox News contributor Geraldo Rivera told Smith. “They do everything to maximize profit.” “There’s nothing wrong with maximizing profit,” Smith insisted. “That’s what they’re supposed to do as a publicly traded airline.” “But when you book and overbook,” Rivera replied, “paid passengers have to give up their seats. This is not business. This is reckless, foolhardy imposition of your own personal convenience – what happened to ‘the customer is always right’?”

Smith continued, “But look, I get where you’re coming from with this, but at the end of the day, we’re talking here about an airline, a company that exists solely for the purpose of transporting passengers from one place in the country to another. If you just consider the fact that 15 or so years ago we had two airplanes crash into the World Trade Center in New York City, I think you’ll understand that they were right to be edgy. And that goes especially in a situation in which the passenger in question was not a genuine American. As a matter of fact, if you take a look at the video of what happened on the plane, it’s obvious that his behavior suggests that he’s from another part of the world, and that’s that.”

Rivera asked, “You can’t possibly be serious, Sandra? Are you actually saying that the company was right to, first, overbook the flight, and then secondly, call security to beat up the man simple because his behavior suggested he wasn’t a true American? And what does that even mean?” Again, Smith wouldn’t be confused. “Look Geraldo, at the end of the day, you have to understand the fact that the moment Americans see a non-white person sitting next to them on a plane, they get chills. Some of them get outright angry as well, and while that’s not ideal, it’s certainly understandable. We can’t blame people for fearing for their lives because of the terrible tragedy this country endured during 9/11.”

“What’s more, I would even go so far as to say that the man had it coming for one simple reason. If that had been a white person, they would have likely stepped out of the plane and waited for the next flight, not to mention that they would probably also have been compensated for the inconvenience in some way or another. Instead, since this guy wasn’t white, his reaction was also different from that of a white person, which is why he refused to give up his seat. If he’d done that, everything would have gone more smoothly and without incident. This way, because he was stubborn, he ended up getting the short end of the stick. That’s just not how white people behave, and non-whites in this country need to learn that. We’re more civilized than the rest, which is why we’re at the top of the food chain. The guy had it coming, end of story,” she concluded.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/21/realnewsrightnowcom/internet-story-claiming-trump-wants-renew-military/,"President Donald Trump has asked for the heads of every protester who demanded his tax return.

Trump has dismissed calls for his tax returns on Twitter. “I did what was almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?”

However, the matter didn’t end here!

Eric Trump decided to throw more lights on what they have for Americans during a brief phone interview with KYXL Radio.

 

Eric argued that Trump’s tax return is   “irrelevant,” largely because “he knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes.” He said, “When you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.”

Eric continued, “And while we’re on the subject, I kind of have to say, it’s funny how taxes work. They sort of punish the hardest working and most productive members of our society while taking nothing from those who would rather be lazy and beg on the streets. That’s kind of not fair. What he have here is a system that flat out punishes those who want to contribute and make their lives better and at the same time, rewards those who want to be nothing more than dead weight. The worst part is, I’m not saying something that’s revolutionary here; this system has been in place ever since the country was established. My father, regardless of the fact that he’s president, is just one person out of millions of those who are capable enough to be successful but are simultaneously struck down by our tax system. That’s a catastrophe.”

The self-proclaimed businessman then revealed plans to “fix” the broken tax system of the United States. “At the end of the day, it’s irrelevant whether my father chooses to disclose his tax return or not. It won’t matter soon anyway,” Eric argued. Asked to elaborate, he said that President Trump is soon going to move forward with an executive order that “cancels taxes for extra productive people in the U.S. economy.” “It’s our way of saying ‘good job’ to all those hard-working men and women who are single-handedly keeping our national budget afloat by working around the clock and paying their taxes. It is to them that this country owes its gratitude. They are the reason we are the single greatest nation in the world.”

“As for the fact that my father happens to be among the people who are to be freed from paying tax, I can assure you there is no conflict of interest there. This is not a move designed to make it so my father doesn’t have to pay tax; like I said, it’s a sort of ‘thank you’ from him to the entrepreneurs, businessmen and other hard-working Americans who have done their duties thus far. As for the rest, I guess they’ll just have to find some other way to get free meals once the economy starts favoring those who are willing to actually get off their butts and go to work. No more freeloaders, that’s where we’re going with this. Bottom line, if you’ve got two working legs and a minimally functioning brain, you can sustain yourself. And you’re going to have to pretty soon,” Eric concluded."

He is to sign an executive order to this effect this week.

He claimed, “I’ve seen it in all kinds of TV documentaries. Horrible attacks on good Americans using hatchets or bows and arrows. You can’t trust these Indians.”
President Trump consulted with the appropriate members of the government and found that most Indians do not possess the relevant immigration documents. “That means they are here illegally. I had to act.”
Further criticism is to be found on the President’s Twitter account:

One sentence in a NYC couples suicide note tells the story of how so many Americans are feeling about health care these days. With premiums skyrocketing, its difficult to pay for healthcare even if you dont have medical issues like this couple did. This is tragic and is symbolic of the desperation so many people are feeling right now. A Manhattan couple committed suicide just a few hours after Senate Republicans tried to pass a bill that would repeal Obamacare. But three members of their own party  including Sen. John McCain  voted against the bill and it failed to pass, keeping the Affordable Care Act in place for now. The couple jumped out of a window of a New York City office building together in desperation over their inability to afford their health care: We both have medical issues, we just cant afford the health care. The incident happened early Friday morning on the corner of Madison Avenue and 33rd Street  just a block from the Empire State Building. A 53-year-old chiropractor and his 50-year-old wife jumped out of a window of their recently-closed ninth-floor office in the 17-story building. Their bodies were covered with white sheets once police arrived at the scene, shutting down the entire block to investigate. The couple left behind suicide notes in a ziploc bag, that also included their IDs. Police have not released their names yet, but a photo obtained by the New York Post shows part of the letter, and it identifies the woman as Patricia. The note was titled We had a wonderful life. A law enforcement source who spoke with the Post said the womans note said: Our kids are upstairs, please take care of them. The man left one behind too, which read: We both have medical issues, we just cant afford the health care. The building that the couple jumped from includes offices for law and advertising firms, therapists offices and commercial space. No further information on the couple has been released. Its unclear how many children they left behind. Perry Kim, 49, a worker at Pure Green, a juice shop on the same block, said that he was outside just after 5:30am this morning when he heard an ahhh noise and saw two people fall from the top of the building. The man appeared to hit his head and the woman had suffered abdominal injuries. They landed face up to the sky. Comments"

Things just took a bad turn for Clinton when a key witness agreed to testify against her.

Not coincidentally, he is also a co-founder of the firm Fusion GPS that disseminated the widely debunked fake news dossier containing over-the-top stories about Donald Trump going to Russian hotels and engaging in “golden showers.”

“Pope Francis is using his platform to push a dangerous far-left political ideology on vulnerable people around the world, people who trust him because of his position,” Putin said.

“If you look at what he (the Pope) says it’s clear that he is not a man of God. At least not the Christian God. Not the God of the Bible,” Putin said at the Naval Cathedral of St. Nicholas in Kronstadt.

Pope Francis Vs Putin

“He dreams of a world government and a global communist system of repression.

“As we have seen before in communist states, this system is not compatible with Christianity.”

The pope has become increasingly brazen this year in pushing the globalist agenda and far-left talking points upon the masses. Earlier this year he called for a global central bank and financial authority, and more recently he said “Americans need to be ruled by a world government as soon as possible for their own good.”

Pope Francis’s idea that Americans would be better off under a world government doesn’t stop there. The radical leftist pontiff also went on record stating that Europe should become one country under one government.

He is also on record calling for a China-style one child policy for Western nations, as well as telling a congregation in Rome that having a personal relationship with Jesus is “dangerous and harmful.”

While Putin is a practicing Christian, he is not a Roman Catholic, and the pope is not his leader. According to his recent statements, President Putin does not even consider Pope Francis to be Christian.

The Russian president is rarely openly critical of foreign leaders, instead preferring to use diplomacy to win people over to his side. However notorious globalists including George Soros, Jacob Rothschild and Bill Gates have received tongue lashings before, and now Pope Francis has joined their company.

Pope Francis is trying to lay the groundwork for a global communist government. President Putin is wise to his ruse and has called him out on it. It’s time for more world leaders to tell the pope to stay in his own lane.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/14/alex-jones/infowars-alex-jones-falsely-says-george-soros-hill/,"An email leaked by WikiLeaks reveals that when Hillary Clinton was US secretary of state in 2011, billionaire George Soros instructed her on how to handle unrest in Albania, stressing it needs urgent attention at senior levels of the US government. Dear Hillary, begins the email dated January 24, 2011 from the founder of Open Society Foundations, Soros. A serious situation has arisen in Albania which needs urgent attention at senior levels of the US government. You may know that an opposition demonstration in Tirana on Friday resulted in the deaths of three people and the destruction of property, Soros says, according to the leaked email. Three men were shot dead as anti-government demonstrators clashed with police in the Albanian capital in late January of 2011. Supporters of the opposition Socialist Party refused to accept the results of a 2009 election, citing corruption and fraud, when then-Prime Minister Sali Berishas Democratic Party won by a thin margin. Berisha accused the opposition of attempting to provoke a Tunisia-style uprising, saying the bastard children of Albanias own Ben Alis conceived Tunisian scenarios. There are serious concerns about further unrest connected to a counter-demonstration to be organized by the governing party and a follow-up event by the opposition two days later to memorialize the victims, Soros says. The prospect of tens of thousands of people entering the streets in an already inflamed political environment bodes ill for the return of public order and the countrys fragile democratic process, he adds. I believe two things need to be done urgently, he adds. 1. Bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha and opposition leader Edi Rama to forestall further public demonstrations and to tone down public pronouncements. 2. Appoint a senior European official as a mediator. Soros suggested three candidates: Carl Bildt, Martti Ahtisaari, and Miroslav Lajcak, saying all have strong connections to the Balkans. The US and the EU must work in complete harmony over this, but given Albanias European aspirations the EU must take the lead, he stressed, adding that his foundation in Tirana was monitoring the situation closely and can provide independent analysis of the crisis. Several days after the email was sent to Clinton, the EU did send one of Soros suggested nominees, Miroslav Lajcak, to meet Albanian leaders in Tirana to try to mediate an end to the unrest, Reuters reported. In March, WikiLeaks launched a searchable archive consisting of 30,322 emails from Hillary Clintons private email server that she used while serving as US secretary of state. The 50,547 pages of documents cover Clintons correspondence from June 30, 2010 to August 12, 2014, of which 7,570 were sent by Clinton herself. Last month, the whistleblowing website published an archive of over 1,200 of Clintons private emails pertaining to the Iraq War. Ahead of the release, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said the upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton would be enough to indict her. Soros made a name for himself as the man who broke the Bank of England by engaging in questionable Forex hedging and betting against the sterling pound  which made him more than $1 billion in one day in September of 1992. Some have speculated that Soros has benefited from insider trading information when making investments. In 2002, a Paris court found Soros guilty of using inside information to profit from a 1988 takeover deal for bank Societe Generale."

The suspect has been charged with one count of second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failure to prevent a hit-and-run incident.

Also remember police in Charlottesville who made this arrest ordered a stand down so the protest or whatever you want to call it would become violent. However it officially looks like the police have arrested a person not related to the incident as this guys name isn't even attached to the car, so what we basically have is a violent Antifa member running around free in Joel Vangheluwe who is a known Antifa supporter by the way. This James Alex Fields subject is simply being used to make it look like a Right Wing attack, when he has no ties to the Dodge Challenger that was used...Unlike the Vangheluwe family who owns the car."

Goldberg has been breeding Pugs, French Bulldogs, Sharpeis and Shitzus from the same sets of parents for nearly 25 years, replacing mom or dad in the line with a son or daughter when she lost one. Veterinary experts say the dogs being produced might look cute, but they are a fragile mess waiting to snap at the first real sign of stress in their lives.

Goldberg was first reported by a family whose pug snapped and completely destroyed more than $15K worth of shoes in a single day. Shortly thereafter a family in Skenektady lost an entire litter of kittens to a Frenchie who just decided baby kittens didn’t belong in this world.

What Goldberg has been doing violates several federal and state laws. She could face up to 15 years in prison and a million dollars in fines. Why, Whoopi? Did you need the money?"

This is highly suspicious and almost suggests that these people were being hired for the rally in Charlottesville this weekend to impersonate “white nationalists” and incite violence so it would look like they were at fault for the chaos.

Trump, who stood side by side with Rosa Parks while she was still alive and received praise for his work improving the community for black youths, recently condemned the violence on “many sides” – both the ironically named “antifa” who showed up to create problems at the “Unite the Right” rally and those who overreacted to the violent Communists attacking them.

For some, this isn’t good enough but Muriel Parks-Rosenberg stepped in on Friday to drop a truth bomb on liberals.

“President Trump’s reaction has been criticized by the Left, but I don’t see what he did wrong,” she said in a speech at the Kennedy Center. “He strongly spoke out against hate both from those who make racial animus their primary cause and anarchists who showed up hoping to watch the world burn.”
“My mother would have been proud of the President’s words,” she told the crowd of about 500 people. “Liberals who seek to use this rally to further their cause and attack President Trump need to go away and never come back.”

“To me, Donald Trump is a modern civil rights icon,” she says.

Nothing makes liberals more angry than a black woman standing up for a strong conservative, so we can expect them to attack Mrs. Parks-Rosenberg as they pretend that they hold a monopoly on “tolerance” (a word liberals use but will never understand).

Arpaio, convicted of a bogus charge for doing the job the people of Maricopa County elected him to do, was about to spend the next 12 to 18 months in a federal minimum security prison.

His second pardon of the day, while not as immediately necessary, held just as much meaning. By granting clemency to Kim Davis, the Kentucky County Clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, her record will be expunged and her good name reinstated. Davis has been seeing a probation officer monthly since the incident nearly two years ago now to prove she’s in compliance with the judge’s orders.

With her record cleared, she no longer has to check in with anyone or list herself on job, volunteer and credit applications as a criminal. A criminal is the farthest thing from what she is. She’s a conscientious freedom fighter who wouldn’t stand by while her rights were trampled and her very existence threatened.

She’s the perfect candidate for a Trump pardon, and that’s exactly what she got. Davis is expected to return to her job in the Clerk’s office where she can now refuse to issue marriage licences to gays and not worry about it becoming a “national scandal.” Davis said, “I told them all along I didn’t care if they went to the county down the street. Just not in my building. Not while my God still relies on me to do the right thing.”

God Bless you, Kim Davis. You’re a real piece of work."

D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E.

The case advances a very high-profile attempt to see if President Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which precludes him from receiving gifts from foreign or state governments. The Trump Organization will be compelled to comply with the courts ruling. This ruling is an important first step in our litigation against President Trump for unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments, Racine said in a statement. Per the Post: Because Trump continues to benefit financially from his hotel, resort and golf properties  in some cases from clients affiliated with foreign governments  Frosh and Racine alleged in their June complaint that Trump had committed unprecedented constitutional violations. State spending that benefits the president may be considered a violation of the domestic emolument clause, which says the president shall not receive any emolument, other than fixed compensation, from the United States, or any of them. The Justice Department had sought to squash the subpoena earlier in September, but Judge Messitte wasnt convinced with their argument. President Trump has been accused of profiting from the presidency, and this case will seek to prove that assertion."

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/11/evening-world/fake-news-about-washington-post-and-roy-moore-accu/,"Allegations of misconduct against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have come in recently. The allegations claim that Moore had intimate relations with an underage female around 40 years ago.
More reports have come to the surface that are bringing the bizarre story to an entirely new level.

The Washington Post reported on Thursday allegations about an incident involving Moore that took place in 1979 between Moore (who was 39 at the time) and a 14-year-old girl.


Lewis wrote a response to JustBrenda explaining hat he would “find out” the truth. He also stated that “Jean,” who we can only assume to be the family friend, had spoken to the Etowah County District Attorney about the evidence that she had obtained. According to Lewis, someone from the office was sent to pick up the phone call.

Bradd Powless, another user on Twitter, told Lewis that he should report the occurrence to the FBI as well as the Secret Service.

Lewis wrote back to Powless explaining that he had already done so, but “Jean” didn’t trust the agencies so she chose to talk to her local law enforcement.

“Can’t blame her with FBI in stories every day,” Lewis added.

It is important that while these allegations haven’t been proven true or disproven to be true, there may be bits and pieces that are accurate. There have been so many reports of sexual misconduct these days that it is important that all evidence and reports be investigated properly so the people of America can find out the truth.

Moore has come forward to say that the allegations of sexual misconduct are false.

Moore spoke to Newsweek and stated, “These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign. After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they surely would have been made public long before now.”

The Alabama special election is only a few weeks away. By December 12th people will be voting, so Moore only has a limited amount of time to prove the allegations to be false. He must reassure conservative voters that he is the right choice for Senate now that former Senator and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions is gone.

Let’s hope the truth comes out in time for voters to be able to make a rational decision.
A Twitter user named Doug Lewis posted on his page that a family friend had reached out to him about the situation. Lewis’s profile shows him as a Trump supporter and a Navy veteran. The woman, who is remaining anonymous, apparently told Lewis that a Washington Post reporter who was called “Beth” had offered to pay the woman a large sum of money if she wold accuse GOP candidate Moore of the crime.

Lewis’s tweet read, “A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore.”

A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore???? 

In later tweets, Lewis continued to report that the family friend had photographs of the reporter who reached out to her. She had even recorded the phone conversation. Lewis explained that he told the family friend to bring the recording and the photograph to her local district attorney’s office. He also insisted that she make a copy of both the recording and the photo for herself as back up.

JustBrenda, another Twitter user, wrote a response to Lewis’s tweet. She stated that she “wouldn’t be surprised” if the allegations about the reporter stood to be true. She went on to say that anyone who makes up sexual offenses “make things harder” for real victims."

Apparently, the chemical poses a high-degree of health risks and side effects. Colgate Total is just one of many products that list triclosan as an active ingredient. Based on scientific evidence, the balance of benefit and risk is favorable for these products, Andrea Fischer, an FDA Spokesperson, said of the announcement. The dangers of triclosan (and a related antibacterial chemical, triclocarban) are many, the Natural Resource Defense Council said in a statement. For starters, its an endocrine disruptor, meaning it interferes with important hormone functions, which can directly affect the brain in addition to our immune and reproductive systems. Specifically, the chemical disturbs thyroid, testosterone, and estrogen regulation, which can create a host of issues including early puberty, poor sperm quality, infertility, obesity, and cancer, the statement continues. Studies have also shown it can lead to impaired learning and memory, exacerbate allergies, and weaken muscle function. The impacts of prolonged exposure during fetal development, infancy, and childhood can be particularly severe, resulting in permanent damage.

Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes. Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnsons coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated. At first, we didnt understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead. Ms. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body. The police have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Johnsons death. Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of filing criminal charges against the employee who caused his death. The young man could possibly be accused of criminal negligence causing death."

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/19/truthcommandcom/no-fda-didnt-hide-information-linking-vaccine-auti/,"Could this be one of the biggest u-turns in medical history?
The FDA inadvertently admitted that autism is a potential adverse side-effect of the DTap vaccine in an accompanying online pamphlet. The pamphlet has since been deleted from the FDA’s website adding to the animosity surrounding the subject.

For years, fears over vaccines and the onset of autism have been dispelled by medical professionals, but this has all changed.

Parents over the years have been criticized for abstaining from getting their child vaccinated over autism fears, but now it turns out they were right all along.

The FDA has published conclusive proof on their website that the DTap vaccine, made by Sanofi Pasteur Inc can cause autism. According to the FDA’s online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, the vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.

The FDA have (unsurprisingly) removed the incriminating article from their website but luckily, screenshots of the online documents remain all over the internet.

You can view a copy of the original vaccine documentation here. Pay special attention to pages 6-11 where you will find the shocking list of adverse reactions. 

Many parents claim their child’s autism is linked to a vaccine they received, but medical professionals have been shy in coming forward to admit the link, often ridiculing the notion of any connection between the two.

So why then, in an official pamphlet, originally published on the FDA’s website, is there a list of adverse reactions that includes Autism? Are they hiding the truth?

Autism rates in America and across the world have risen sharply in the past 20 years, in accordance with the rise in ‘recommended’ vaccines.

It is easy to listen to a media story and brush it off as conjecture, but there are many real stories out there of real families that have been torn apart by the effect that vaccine side-effects have had on their family.

Cynthia Stark is one of these parents. She says she knew immediately when her son had reacted badly to a vaccine, after all who could possibly know what is best for a child than their own parent?

She said she was pressured by the doctor into vaccinating her son and both of their lives have never been the same since.

Many mothers can tell instantly that their child has been effected negatively by a vaccine such as the MMR but little help exists for these parents.

This is just one case among thousands of others out there which can be found with just a little searching.

The health bodies still don’t want the general public to know the real dangers of these vaccines, and keep their potentially harmful side-effect as hidden as they possibly can.

The “Get out of Jail Free” card for vaccine makers needs to be taken away to stop the onslaught of the Autism Spectrum Disorder that is depriving children from a full life and ruining families emotionally, financially, and physically.

It’s about time vaccines are publicly acknowledged by the feds and the media for all the health damages they have caused. Just check out the CDC’s VAERS reports and the vaccine damage payouts by the HHS/HRSA.

According to the report published in March, 2017, by the department of health and human services of the United States, about $3,363,282,409.21 in damages have been paid for adverse reactions and deaths from vaccines between 1989 to 2017.

What that means for the Jones campaign is that it will now be on them to ask for a recount and since the margin is more than .01573, he’ll have to pay for it himself. That could be a costly effort, estimated at nearly $213 million.

The Secretary of State’s office has already announced that the election won’t be certified until after the first of the year, so the Democrat loser will have plenty of time to decide if he’ll waste the taxpayers’ time and money with a fruitless recount.

Unfortunately, that car didn’t last long.

The former President* put his “hard-earned” speaking fees to work getting the car for his daughter, but it quickly became a $1.1 million piece of fish food when she picked up her friends and promptly crashed it into a lake. The Washington Times-Heraldreports:

The younger Obama daughter frantically called police after she apparently went too fast around a turn and drove her car off the road and into Lake Hope, about 32 miles outside of Washington, D.C. Officers noted a “strong smell of marijuana” in the crashed vehicle, but no drugs were found as the wreckage was searched.

Sasha Obama was cited for reckless driving and released into her parents’ custody. Her three passengers, ages 15, 17, and 16, were also released into their parents’ custody. One was treated for “minor injuries” according to Washington Sheriff Donald Harland.

Forgetting for a moment how ironic an Obamacar sinking into Lake Hope is, why would any parent spend more than a million dollars on a car for a child who has just turned 16? Why was she allowed to drive it unsupervised. What if someone had been seriously hurt?

According to police, Sasha Obama admits she was driving “more than 90 mph down Lake Hope Rd.” where the speed limit is 35.

The Obamas have no respect for America, but hopefully Sasha has learned a (expensive) lesson about speeding."

Julia Roberts was speaking on the New York set of her new film, as principal photography began on the drama Ben Is Back.

Michelle Obama paid a visit to the film production while in the vicinity and Julia Roberts agreed to meet her, however she opened up about the differences between America’s most recent First Ladies as soon as Michelle left the set.

“Melania has her priorities straight and she is a great example for our young women,” Julia Roberts said. “Michelle? Talk about a wolf in sheepskin.“

The news comes days after Julia Roberts slammed Celine Dion for criticizing the POTUS and stating that she “hates America.“

“I can’t even look at an American flag anymore. I hate this country,” Canadian Celine Dion said, while complaining about the Trump presidency.

“You’re wrong, Celine,” Julia Roberts fired back. “The America we know and love was destroyed by Obama and his disastrous presidency. If you disagree you can always go back to your own country. In fact, perhaps you really should.”

Celine Dion was one of dozens of liberal celebrities who “threatened” to leave the United States and return to their homelands if America elected Donald Trump as president.

So far, a grand total of zero of these liberal celebrities have followed through with their threat to leave. The sheer hypocrisy makes it hard to believe they really feel as strongly as they claim about Trump.

It’s all hot air and virtue signaling from the celebrity contingent on the left.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/02/blog-posting/mike-pence-did-not-say-women-would-seek-out-sexual/,"The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women cant get legally at all. Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented. So, lets get that straight right away  I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasnt developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if were murderers of innocent beings who cant defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other? the Indiana governor said. And as if that wasnt enough, Pence continued, weve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And thats bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost  we cant have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, lets be clear. And thats part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or Im going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction. Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma, he said. However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? Wed then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost. Donald Trumps new running mate also said, Basically, if Id have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what theyd do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, its not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butchers knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And Im not a murderer. And it gets worse  when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indianas economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, Im telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run, Pence concluded."
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/03/blog-posting/old-internet-claim-obama-will-be-new-1-bill-still-/," A longtime push to honor modern presidents on currency has finally come to fruition. In 2017, Obama’s image will replace George Washington’s
“We thought about creating a new denomination for Obama, but George Washington has had plenty of time in the sun,” John Apple from the Federal Reserve said. “We’ve needed to change things up for a while now.”The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has released several comps but a design has not been finalized. The Bureau will release all compositions in early 2016 and poll the American public letting them help decide which design works best.

Many presidents were bandied about as the new face of the one-dollar bill including Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Reportedly, Reagan almost got the nod to replace Washington, but people within the Federal Reserve felt Obama brought a much needed multiracial mix to American currency.

“Obama being of mixed-race was probably what tipped things; however, we looked at overall accomplishments as well. Frankly, he [Obama] has done more for the betterment of this country than Reagan did, and he still has a year left. More importantly, the racial complexion of America has changed and putting Obama on the dollar bill really, really helps express that.”

An official republican response has not been issued, but Reserve leaders are confident that everyone will agree that this is a progressive step forward."

Kennedy International Airport. This marks the first successful story following President Trump’s executive order to protect the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. Muhammad, 32, was questioned due to the heightened security measures that resulted from the presidential executive order. The suspect attempted to enter the country with a tourist visa and claimed to be visiting family in order to attend this year’s Super Bowl LI.

Former Attorney General, Sally Yates, who was ousted by President Trump after failing to support the executive order, released a public apology via popular social media, Snapchat.

“I would like to express a sincere and utter apology to President Donald J. Trump. Due to unforeseen circumstances, there is no way I could have predicted the outcome of the situation. If afforded the opportunity to continue my position as Attorney General, I would be more than ecstatic to comply.”  

 

Officials are waiting to release an official press statement. FBI Director, James Comey, commented “We are unsure if accomplices are still at large. Until matters are addressed, we will keep additional details from the public eye. The security of our nation is the number one priority.”

The terror suspect is currently detained by local authorities and requested a public defender. The White House Press Secretary declined comment until after the release of an official press statement.

Liberal rag L.A. Times reports:

President Trump, who chided his opponents during the campaign for speaking Spanish, has made a tangible change to the White House website to eliminate bilingual access.

The site, which the Trump administration took over on Friday, no longer includes an option for translation into Spanish…

Spokesman Sean Spicer suggested the translation option may return but made no specific commitment on timing when asked about it Monday. He spoke generally about the high volume of work facing the technology team during the changeover.

“We are continuing to build out the website…,” Spicer said. “We’ve got the IT folks working overtime on that now.”

During a Republican primary debate, Trump lashed out at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush when he spoke Spanish. “This is a country where we speak English,” Trump said.

President Trump is spreading the message that we conservatives have been lamenting for years. This is America. We have a culture. We have a language. We have a set of laws and rules by which EVERYONE in this country is expected to abide."

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/14/blog-posting/fake-news-alert-bloggers-claim-protesters-can-be-l/,"The United States is one of the best places to live. You have rights that are given to you from the Constitution, you have the freedom to do what you want (within reason of course), and you have the ability to live in one of the strongest nations in the world.

At least it is supposed to be like that. Unfortunately there are people called liberals that want to completely destroy everything that the Constitution gives you. They want to take away your free speech because it might offend them. They want to take away your ability to have a gun because they don’t like it. And finally they want to make the country into a globalist area.

Despite the fact that the United States was founded with the Constitution being the document that gives people power, the liberals have decided that they don’t like that anymore. They are literally doing what they can to destroy any evidence of that.

These Two Have Proven That They Don’t Follow The Constitution

The most prominent example would be the fact that after the election was held, in which Donald Trump was the winner, entitled liberals were so angry that they decided they would go out and protest the results. Yes they were protesting the results of a FAIR election, despite the fact that there was still three million illegal votes cast.

And what do the Democratic leaders have to say about all of this? They have kept their mouths shut on the entire thing. Despite all summer long of having the liberals and their friends in the media saying that Trump needs to talk to his supporters for their “damages” caused, they haven’t done that either.

But it isn’t just the fact that the Democratic leaders are staying silent on the whole issue. There have been numerous reports that these protesters are actually getting paid by George Soros in order to create enough of a disturbance that something would get done. What the liberals want to do is stop the transfer of power.

That way Trump wouldn’t be the person in charge of the entire country. It would still be underneath President Obama. But that is what the liberals want; instead there is a new bill that is coming out that is sure to make liberals everywhere cry.

A Republican lawmaker has just come up with the perfect solution to make sure that these protesters stop acting like entitled liberals. The bill in question would allow authorities to charge protesters with committing “economic terrorism.” Washington state Senator Doug Ericksen is the one that is responsible for coming up with the bill.

 “I respect the right to protest, but when it endangers people’s lives and property, it goes too far. Fear, intimidation, and vandalism are not a legitimate form of political expression. Those who employ it must be called to account. We are not just going after the people who commit these acts of terrorism. We are going after the people who fund them. Wealthy donors should not feel safe in disrupting middle-class jobs.”

People Who Protest Like This Are Going To Get A Rude Wake Up Call

The proposed bill, which is going to pass through considering that the Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, would make protesting a class C felony if they create any sort of “economic disruption” or “jeopardize human life and property.”

It would also mean that people that have been discovered to be in violation of this would face up to five years in prison, or a $10,000 fine, or both. Not only that, but any group that organizes a protest that is considered disruptive would also be charged with “economic terrorism.”

That means that these precious snowflakes that think they can get away with causing damage because they’re upset would have to think twice. But the saddest part about this whole thing is the fact that it was forced to be created. That was because the liberals that were protesting have a difficult time being peaceful.

 They honestly think that the best way to go about this whole thing is to make sure that they cause as much damage and destruction as possible. And their defense for it is to say that they have a right to protest. The last time I checked, protesting didn’t involve lighting trashcans on fire or smashing car windshields. That isn’t a protest; that’s a full-blown riot!
And this is what we have been seeing from the numerous protests that have been going on since the election. There are people doing whatever they can to cause as much damage and destruction as possible. And these people need to learn that they can’t get away with this any longer.

Of course the other sad part is that a vast majority of these protesters didn’t even vote in the election. They had a prime opportunity to make sure that their voices were heard and they completely ignored that. And now they decided that they want to have their voice heard by causing as much damage as possible.

But that wasn’t the worst thing that they did. There was a report on CNN that had one of the protesters promising actual DEATH just to make sure that they got what they wanted. Yes these people are so crazy that they want to have people killed just to make sure that they get what they want. It’s people like this that had the bill created in the first place.

Share this article with your friends and family to show that people that are going to be protesting and causing damage and mayhem where they go are about to get a rude wake up call. A bill is going to be passed, thanks to an all Republican Congress, which is going to make sure that these protesters face justice for causing destruction.

This is just a way to ensure that we are stronger as a country under Trump. The past eight years have taught children that it is okay to be whiny and complain about everything. That time has past. We no longer have to accept the Band-Aid generation that was seen underneath Obama. This is just the first step into making this country stronger and it is going to continue. We WILL Make America Great Again!

Perhaps we could figure out why theyre risking their lives entering both America and European countries if western culture offends them so! According to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a disputed view of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, Requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of forced assimilation of the Muslim community. Heres the pledge: From this time forward, [under God,] I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey. Pretty oppressive, right? If you are graciously accepted into a country and you cant even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Heres the national anthem: Australians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; Weve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in natures gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In historys page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair. Beneath our radiant Southern Cross Well toil with hearts and hands; To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands; For those whove come across the seas Weve boundless plains to share; With courage let us all combine To Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair. Super oppressive lyrics, right? If a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society, they can go right back where they came from. Moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country. If those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enterits really that simple. Watch Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman, Unthman Badar, make the case against Muslim school children singing the national anthem. It begins around the 10 minute point. This is outrageous! Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nations population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things! Either assimilate, or LEAVE. They are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. Its their faith. The west doesnt get it because most liberals are faithless. It irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then dont want to be patriotic to that country.. How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australians convert or be beheaded! It makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldnt pray but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they wont want to learn the country they have invaded history because its not theirs! Muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to. This what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country. Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?"
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/22/blog-posting/mega-pastor-john-hagee-wants-jail-women-who-use-go/,"“One of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the Lord’s name in vain. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). The word “vain” means “for no reason” or “useless.”

“Thus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written God’s name was holy and should not be used for regular words.

“Dr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that “in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.”

 

“Saying the Lord’s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,” Hagee elaborated. “But, that’s precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I don’t think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.”

The pastor reprimanded: “But, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.”

Asked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: “Well, we’d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If you’re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God’s name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lord’s name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of God’s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Maker’s good name.”/religionlo.com/"
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/23/blog-posting/tale-killer-whales-eating-japanese-whalers-fake-ne/,"Minneapolis, MN – Target announced today the retail giant will be discontinuing sales of the Holy Bible. The company has come under fire recently from religious groups for its new transgender bathroom policy. The King James Bible has been available for purchase at Target stores ever since the company was founded as Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902.
Speaking with CNBC, Target CEO Bryan Hornell cited recent protests from what he calls “religious extremists” as the reason to pull the bible from its shelves. “Target will no longer cater to religious extremists,” said Hornell. “If that means removing the bible from our shelves, then so be it.” Hornell said the big box chain is “sticking to its guns” regarding their bathroom policy, and will be phasing out anything having to do with religion. “We believe that everyone, every team member, every guest, and every community, deserves to be treated equally, regardless of their religious beliefs.”

Hornell may be referring to a recent viral video of a mother storming through a Target store waving a bible and warning customers that Target is unsafe for children. “Mothers have enough decency to get out of this store, it’s a dangerous place,” the mother screams in the video. “What Target has done is very hateful. It’s hatred towards families. It’s hateful towards mothers. It’s hateful towards children…Are you gonna let the devil rape your children?”

Traynesha Holmes, a Target employee who witnessed the bizarre demonstration, described the situation. “A disturbed woman with about ten kids came in the store yelling and screaming that Target was raping children…it was hilarious at first but after a while we were getting scared that they might be a religious cult and would start shooting.”

Over 1.2 million people have signed a petition promising to boycott Target stores. A new campaign, launched today, will see a #FlushTarget truck visit every store in the retailer’s home of Minnesota.

The 47-year-old man, who leaves behind his wife and six children, took his own life to avoid voting for Donald Trump during the Electoral College that will swear the next president-elect this week.

A letter he wrote before taking his own life explains the reasons for his apparent suicide.

“ I do not want to carry the burden of Trump’s election on my shoulders, so for the greater good of my children and future generations, I am doing what I believe is best for my country and I hope others will follow in my footsteps ”
– Jeremy Hashville

Jeremy Hashville, a Michigan elector, has taken his own life to avoid voting in favor of Trump despite Trump’s victory as state laws requires him to vote, an act he hopes others will have the courage to follow to “save his country”.

A tragic end
According to the Detroit City Coroner’s report, the last moments of Mr. Hashville would have been “excruciating painful”.

“The deceased would have first attempted to take his life by swallowing 36 laxative tablets that he possibly mistook for antidepressants” describes the 236 pages report.

“Despite intolerable intestinal pain, the man then threw himself in front of a bus after literally throwing himself from the balcony of his apartment on the sixth floor but would have miraculously survived,” commented James Arnold of the Detroit Police.

“The deceased would have finally covered his own body with gasoline before succumbing to his injuries after lighting himself on fire by inserting his head into the family microwave,” he concluded about the tragic death.

Jeremy Hashville was a member of an anti-Trump movement trying to convince 37 major voters of the Grand Old Party to abandon their candidate, forcing the US House of Representatives to choose a new president among the Republicans.

Are the Obama’s  the worst First Family in American history or what?

Barack Obama has admitted to doing drugs with his “Choom Gang” and is the worst President of all time. Michelle spends all her time ruining our kids’ school lunches and spending millions on vacations with her daughters. And the Obama kids are an embarrassment – going to drinking parties, and maybe even doing drugs in public.

They are shameful swindlers, wasting your tax dollars on their comfort and profligacy.

But now, a story is going viral that claims the most outrageous waste of taxpayer money by the Obama family.

First Grandma Marian Robinson, 79, will receive a lifetime 160K government pension when she leaves the White House next year, according to congressional budget statements.

According to documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mrs. Robinson earned the lifetime pension for “services rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver” for granddaughters Malia, 18, and Sasha, 15, during President Obama’s two terms in office.


 
Michelle Obama’s mom got to live like a queen in the White House, but they are going to pay her $160,000 every year for the rest of her life for babysitting her own granddaughters?

This is the kind of graft and corruption that happens in places like Iraq and North Korea. Michelle Obama’s mom didn’t earn a pension that’s THREE TIMES bigger than the average American family’s income.

It seems that just like Barack, the rest of the Obama’s never had real jobs, and instead of live high on the hog off the backs of regular taxpaying Americans.

What do you think about this?

Via Empire News:

President Obama has ordered a $200,000, life-sized, bronze statue of himself, with plans to install it in the entryway of the White House. The president says that his legacy “should not be diminished,” and that this is the only way he can “keep an eye” over Trump, as well as future presidents.

“I have been president for only eight years, and in that time, I have done what no other presidents could do in all their time in total,” said Obama. “I have created a legacy that should not be diminished. I have created something that no future president will be able to do. In that regard, I have commissioned this statute, with plans to have it permanently erected in the entryway of the White House, so that all who enter can remember me fondly.”

The statue will not be allowed to be removed, as every president is allowed to leave one thing in the White House that must never be touched by future presidents. William Howard Taft left his giant bathtub. Bill Clinton left one of his saxophones. George W. Bush left a piece of mirror and a rolled up hundred.

Those of us that criticize the so-called religion of peace are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for Islam anti-blasphemy laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law. Anti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law. According to Minneapolis local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to harass them. The Star Tribune reported: The city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance. The service, operated through the citys 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice, according to a city news release issued on Monday. The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported. Since the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States, Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the citys website. In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated. The citys Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated, Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the citys website. The Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: I will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trumps desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office. The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberals alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, dont they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they dont realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslims demands. This anti-blasphemy hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Germanys approach in the 1930s when they started to purge out anyone who was perceived as a threat. Trying to normalize the concept of turning in your neighbor for their opinion is nothing short of chilling and should be looked at as a major threat to our freedom. What do you think?

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/05/stgeorgegazettecom/story-about-ryan-announcing-trumps-resignation-com/,"During a Monday press conference that media outlets were banned from airing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced that the president was sending “thoughts and prayers” to the victims of an alleged terrorist attack in London and to the families of seven dead U.S. sailors. Spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that President Donald Trump had already appeared on camera on Monday for several minutes, although he took no questions. Spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the Justice Department, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice. He also insisted that Trump has the power to fire Mueller if necessary. “If you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president,” he said. “That is a fact.”

Asked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the president’s power, or in other words, its limitations – if they exist – Spicer argued that the Constitution “clearly states” what the President of the United States can and cannot do. “However,” he added, “one must also recognize the fact that our Constitution was written quite a while ago and, as such, isn’t ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the American society nowadays. One of those issues is also the limit of the president’s power. Just like our language and many other things that are typically American, our Constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by. And if it doesn’t do so on its own, then it has us, the people of America, to help it. However, seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days, the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions.”

Spicer continued, “As a result, the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors, especially some of the first ones like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. As a matter of fact, in order to be able to deal with the problems of today, which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the Constitution was written, Donald Trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country. In other words, there’s a real need to follow the aforementioned ‘if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president’ rule. For example, President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision.”

“This is something that’s necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time. To make things perfectly clear once again: this is not something that’s exclusive to just Donald Trump; whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power, because this power is linked to the position, not the man in the position. It is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events. It is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us. We need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long. That goes especially for interpreting the Constitution of the United States,” Spicer concluded./politicops.com"

He has been doing everything he can to mess up what Trump is doing. And being a liberal elite, he can get away with it. Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up too. A little odd, no? This concerning practice has gotten on the last nerve of the Trump administration and it shows that they are concerned with what Obama is trying to do. Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be.
Obama first went to Italy when Trump was there to try to disrupt what was going on there. Does he not know when to give up? It seems like now is as good a time as any. Obama’s administration is currently under investigation for many criminal actions they did while in office. Maybe he wants to try to deflect all of the negative press about him to Trump, like he so often does. But this last on was truly an Obama move.

The liberal media has been attacking the Trump administration for the hotel accommodations snafu that caused them to be without a hotel for awhile. But as it turns out, that was actually the Obama administration’s problem, not Trumps. So he is getting blamed for something that is clearly not his fault yet again. That is what conservatives have gotten used to over the years. Apparently liberals can do no wrong. When will the mainstream media report on that?

“The funny thing,” a White House official said, “is that the United States delegation probably also would not have had hotel rooms if Hillary Clinton had become president. It was already too late by Election Day.”

“But I bet even if Hillary had to sleep in a youth hostel,” he went on, “no one in the press would say it was her staffs’ fault.”


That is the double standard that we have to live with as Americans and it will not get any better. What do you think about this whole mess?

Canadian tourist, John OKeef and his friend from Chicago, Allan Brooks captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake. We reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before my friend Allan finally shot it with a rifle and wounded it to the head explains OKeef. Id heard of the Lake Michigan monster, but never did I expect to catch it myself, claims the 63-year-old Canadian tourist. The great white shark estimated at more than 1.2 tons is the biggest fish ever caught in the region, believe experts. Professor of biology at the University of Illinois, Allan Jameson said: This is not common to find such a beast so far inland. Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region. he admits, visibly puzzled. It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes, he told reporters. According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time. U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the regions waters is highly unlikely as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems. In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930."
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/14/uspoln/no-bachmann-didnt-say-whites-suffered-more-under-o/,"On Sunday, ex-Rep. Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has “sanctioned” violence, as long it protects the “people favorable to the Obama position, politically.” She insisted that the president is sending “a signal to Donald Trump supporters: Don’t attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted.” She also linked the Obama administration’s “lawlessness” to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving “normal” people helpless in the face of anarchy.

“And these days it has become so obvious that I’m honestly surprised we’re not having riots throughout the country,” she said. “When did this become a nation of criminals? I didn’t get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. I’m not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America.”

The ex-Rep. then argued that “not even slaves” suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. “It’s true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, I’m not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear – we’re supposed to be all evolved right now, we’re supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? He’s protecting those who want to hurt white people, as you’ve seen in Minneapolis.”

“In fact,” Bachmann continued firing, “I don’t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what’s been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obama’s presidency.” She added, “Because, let’s face it, during that time, we’ve had the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we’ve had countless terrorist attacks, we’ve had many racial killings and crimes and we’ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America’s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I’m guessing he does.”

“And let’s get one thing straight – I’m not just saying this because I happen to be white. No, even if I were Asian or Hindu or Martian, whatever, I’d be saying the same thing all over again,” Bachmann quipped. “That’s what I’m trying to point out – white people in America have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that I’m seriously worried whether or not we’ll still be around come 2025. Because, at the rate we’re going, all we need is another black president four years from now and we’ll be done, just like that. Muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another – white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves. And that’s just one step away from extinction,” Bachmann concluded./politicot.com"
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/17/halfwaypostcom/white-house-chefs-faux-resignation-fake-news-menu/,"Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead. Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasnt utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House. Its kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef, said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal hes eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trumps orders from drive-through windows and scoop the Presidents ice cream from the carton. Mr. Trumps favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the Presidents eating habits to the press. Its borderline creepy, the staffer said. The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like hes dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. Its gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something. Mr. Trumps McDonalds habits are even weirder. He orders the same thing every time, said the staffer. He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&Ms. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up. No wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit. The Halfway Post wishes her good luck on her future endeavors. (Photo courtesy of Shelby Bell.) Share this: Twitter Facebook Google"
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/18/george-will/do-tax-preparers-outnumber-firefighters-and-police/,"Cynics are said to be people who are prematurely disappointed about the future. Such dyspepsia is encouraged by watching Republicans struggle to move on from the dogs breakfast they have made of health-care reform to the mares nest of tax reform. Concerning which, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), whose preternatural optimism makes Candide seem morose, says: If were going to truly fix our tax code, then weve got to fix all of it. Trying to fix all of immigration in 2013 and health care in 2010 with comprehensive legislation left almost everyone irritable. Perhaps the third time is the charm. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is skeptical about fixing much this year, even given Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells (R-Ky.) decision to limit the August recess. The fourth-most-senior Democrat and the ranking minority member on the tax-writing Finance Committee, Wyden, 68, is usually relaxed but now is especially so, for two reasons. He was just elected to a fourth term. And for him and other Finance Committee Democrats, tax reform is, so far, an undemanding spectator sport. This was underscored last weekend when, as he was being driven from one Oregon town hall to another, he read a Wall Street Journal article headlined GOP Tax Overhauls Fate Rests on Big Six Talks. Five of the six were in an almost taunting photo provided to the Journal by Ryans office  Ryan, McConnell, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The missing sixth person was National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn. No congressional Democrat is included. Evidently, Republicans plan to pass tax reform without Democratic votes, under reconciliation, which is inherently partisan  51 votes will suffice  and limits debate to 20 hours. The 1986 reform, the gold standard of bipartisan tax legislation, was on the Senate floor for more than 100 hours spread over 20 days  after seven days of hearings and 16 days of mark-up. Ryan and McConnell say tax reform will be revenue-neutral. This might require dynamic scoring  calculating that reformed incentives will stimulate economic growth  to project implausible growth rates. Plausibility is, however, optional, as it was in April, when Mnuchins department produced a tax plan that resembled Lincolns soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death. The document  shorter than a drug store receipt, says Wyden  was one page long, contained 218 words, eight numbers and a thumping vacuity, the promise to eliminate tax breaks for special interests. Last November, Mnuchin told CNBC there would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class, meaning no net cut after lost deductions. In Mnuchins January confirmation hearing, Wyden mischievously suggested calling this the Mnuchin rule, which enthralled Mnuchin, who later said: I feel like Im now in good company with the Volcker rule and the Buffett rule. In a June hearing, however, Mnuchin told Wyden: You made it a rule, I didnt make it a rule. It would be entertaining to watch Republicans try to adhere to that rule while fulfilling their promise  from which they began retreating on Tuesday  to repeal the 3.8 percent Obamacare tax on investment income. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) No Democrat, says Wyden, likes the status quo. When he recently described the tax code as a rotting economic carcass, his wife asked him to stop scaring the children. The complexity of the code, which is about 4 million words, is why America has more people employed as tax preparers (1.2 million) than as police and firefighters. If tax compliance were an industry, it would be among the nations largest; it devours 6.1 billion hours annually, the equivalent of more than 3 million full-time workers. Wyden knows he sounds like a one-song jukebox when he keeps stressing wage growth but he notes that last week the encouraging number of jobs created in June (222,000) was accompanied by discouraging wage growth (year-over-year, 2.5 percent, barely ahead of inflation). Many economists are puzzled that low unemployment (4.4 percent) is not forcing employers to bid up the price of labor. Wyden says he is puzzled by neither the cause (persistent slow growth, limping at about 2 percent) nor the cause of this cause  insufficient money in middle-class paychecks to power an economy where 70 percent of the fuel comes from consumer spending. He favors, for example, doubling the earned-income tax credit. He seems, however, to be preemptively, but not prematurely, disappointed about a legislative process that will fall somewhat short of fixing all of what ails the rotting carcass.

She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an assault weapons ban and said, Im with the majority today, taking a stand. Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that the fact that youre even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me youre ignorant. Dont you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented? Asked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that at one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly dont possess the most fundamental knowledge of history?

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/06/uspoln/no-trumps-reported-pick-usda-chief-scientist-did-n/,"The research section of the USDA studies everything from nutrition to climate change, and according to the 2008 Farm Bill the “chief scientist” is supposed to be the leader “among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.” President Donald Trump’s pick, Sam Clovis, doesn’t seem to have any of those credentials. He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter.

When asked to comment on his credentials in a recent interview with KYXL Radio, Clovis, who is currently working as the senior White House advisor within the USDA, argued that he was “proud” he didn’t have any scientific credentials or education, because “scientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead individuals anyway.” Asked to elaborate, he said that he was “glad” to be working in the Trump administration, but that he was, at the same time, “disappointed” as to where he was assigned. “While I can certainly appreciate President Trump’s reasons for placing me at my current position, at the same time I can’t help but feel as though my abilities are being severely misused here,” he said. “I do not agree with anything these people are trying to do. I mostly spend my days watching them run around in circles, trying to change the world or something. In reality, they’re just wasting their time.”

“When I get back home from work – believe me – I thank God every single day that he had the mercy not to make me a scientist as well,” Clovis continued. “I’m proud I’m not one of them because they believe in things like evolution and the like. They have no fear from God, no understanding of things that they can’t see, taste, smell, touch or hear. If you ask me, that’s a pretty limited way for one to live their life. And you want to know what the irony is? They’re the ones who keep calling us traditional and conservative. They, who refuse to believe God made man because they found some sort of so-called evidence that man derived from monkeys or whatever. They’re so narrow-minded that they can’t except that we’re different and then they go around calling us the conservatives. It’s funny when you really think about it.”

“That’s why I’m happy I’m not one of them. At the end of the day, scientists are nothing more than a bunch of dumb, regular people with limited vision who think dinosaurs actually existed and the earth is somehow getting warmer. They don’t even consider the fact that there’s more to us, to our species than just the physical and the tangible. It’s as funny as it is pitiful,” he said. When asked why he continues to work as president Trump’s pick for top scientist if that’s how he feels about it, he replied, “Well, just because you’re a member of the Trump administration doesn’t mean you don’t have to pay the bills. That used to work for members of the Obama administration, if I remember correctly. Not now,” Clovis concluded.

The Marines will now fall under the newly created Department of Expeditionary Warfare. 

 

Since 1834 The Marines have fallen under the Department of the Navy. This has always been a thorn in the side of Marines and naturally a source of ridicule from other branches. In 1834 Congress passed the Act for the Better Organization of the Marine Corps, stipulating that the Corps was part of the Department of the Navy as a sister service. The Marines will improve their amphibious attack readiness, and will continue to use the Navy for transportation to be the “First to Fight"".

 

The Marines will have an entirely new ROE and mission. Marine units that don’t accomplish the mission within the 2 month window will be reassigned by the Marine Corps, and will have to watch as another unit finishes the job. “The Marine Corps is a competitive place, we have no room or respect for weak bitches that can’t get in there fast, kill everyone, and get back to the ships in time to get to make the port calls in Asia.” Sgt Major Garrett explained.

 

The move is mainly sentimental since the President has a clear love of The Marines and their traditions. “The Marines have dedicated their lives to the service of this country and have served at the pleasure of the President for many, many years and it's about time they be recognized as a separate department. They are the President’s own and shall remain as such.” President Trump explained."
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/12/antinews/years-old-story-edward-snowden-can-prove-osama-bin/,"Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas:

Edward Snowden (the NSA whistleblower) has made another astonishing revelation. He apparently has documents that prove Osama Bin Laden is on the CIA’s payroll and currently living a luxury lifestyle in the Bahamas.

In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), released various documents regarding government surveillance programs. This resulted in him being charged for committing several crimes.

All of the charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Due to this and the fact he believed it was the correct decision to reveal the shocking extent of phone surveillance by U.S. intelligence agency, he had no choice but to flee.

He currently resides in Russia, this is where he has be offered asylum for one year. Snowden has yet again provided a shocking piece of information. The Moscow Tribune reports that Snowden claims that Osama Bin Laden the infamous former leader of Al Qaeda, is in fact still alive and is in receipt of cash courtesy of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

“I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,”  Snowden claims. “He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”

Snowden claims the CIA faked the death of Osama Bin Laden. After reporting him dead, the man himself and his family were moved to a secret location in the Bahamas.

“Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” Snowden claims. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”

NaijaPicks say that these documents that prove this controversial claim are featured in his 2015 book.

Despite the fact Snowden says he was trying to help the citizens of America by releasing these documents, he is still classed as a fugitive in the USA. This is also despite approximately 168,000 people signing a petition calling for Snowden to be pardoned. This was rejected by the White House rejected on July 28, 2015.

Whilst resident in Hong Kong, Snowden was interviewed by several journalists inside a secret location. He was asked why he left his own country, his reply to The Guardian was:

“I don’t want to live in a society that does these sort of things… I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded.”

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/14/blog-posting/its-fake-nasa-never-said-earth-will-go-dark-15-day/,"There have been many reports about the changes our planet Earth could endure in the months and years to come but many of them didn’t really pan out, making us question everything we read on the internet. But this time, NASA confirms what’s been circling the web recently – our planet Earth will experience total darkness for 15 days in November 2017 starting from November 15 to November 29.


 
NASA reports that this strange occurrence was expected to happen but they didn’t know exactly when. Upon more detailed examination the astronomers from NASA confirmed that the phenomenon will start on November 15 at 3:00 am and will most likely last until November 30, 4:45 pm.

According to experts this blackout will be caused by an astronomical event between Jupiter and Venus. There was even a detailed 1000 pages document written by Charles Bolden, head of NASA explaining the strange event to officials at the White House.

According to the report, during this specific period Jupiter and Venus will come in close proximity of each other and will be separated by just 1 degree. Venus will move to the south-west of Jupiter and as a result it will shine 10 times brighter than Jupiter. Venus’ bright light will heat up the gases in Jupiter causing a reaction which will release a an absurdly high amount of hydrogen into the space. This reaction will come in contact with our Sun at 2:50 am on November 15th.

Once the hydrogen reaches the Sun, a massive explosion is bound to occur on the surface of the Sun, increasing the temperature to more than 9000 degrees. The whole process will generate so much heat that the Sun will change its color into a bluish shade. Once this happens, the Sun will need a minimum of 14 days to restore its normal color and temperature.

As a result of this strange phenomenon, the Sun’s light will be seen much dimmer from the Earth and hence the 15-day blackout NASA is talking about.

“We do not expect any major effects from the Blackout event. The only effect this event will have on Earth is an increase of 6 – 8 degrees in temperature. the polar cap will be mostly affected by this. No one should worry much. This event would be similar to what Alaskans experience in the winter”, Bolden said.

Yet consider the society Americans would have to live in  the choices they would all have to make  to enable that kind of defense. Every member of Congress, and every other American of whatever age, would have to go to baseball practice, or to school, or to work, or to the post office, or to the health clinic  or to any of the other places mass shootings now take place  with a gun on their hip. And then, when an attack came and they returned fire, they would probably kill or wound not the assailant but another innocent bystander, as studies have repeatedly shown. That is the society the gun lobby is working toward. Is it the one Americans want? President Trump said just the right thing after the attack on Wednesday: We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nations capital is here because, above all, they love our country. We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans, that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace. Yet he will not help create that nation if he continues to advocate easy access to lethal weapons."

She is always, angry, something that she wears as a badge of honor. She has pushed the lie about President Trump having Russian connections and has even had to admit that no facts exists to condemn the White House for. Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings. Known in some circles as the Poverty Pimp, Waters has been peddling race baiting, socialist agendas, and a hatred for President that borders is obsessive, she has accomplished very little in her career. Even today, she finds herself above impeachment and was so terribly rude to one of her own constituents that watching the video of it is cringe worthy, to say the least. On top of that, she seems to imply that as a woman of color, she can not be thrown out of office. While the word color may have been been Congress since she mumbles more than speaks, it is clear that race over substance matters is the Waters credo. Then again, when one attends only 10% of the meetings that are expected of them, there is not much other than skin color for her to drivel on about. She has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority. Thankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service. Still, America was well aware that Waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there. Come to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there! Sources: Teddy Stick  1tch"

According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.

Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.

Crime Scene Photo of residence at 3845 Toolson Lane courtesy of Vernal Heights Police Department.
Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.

When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.

After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.


 
The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.

 

According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.

William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:

 “I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.
 

Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.

Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.

In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.

Crime Scene Photo of basement ‘tool wall’ courtesy of Vernal Heights Police Department.
Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.

Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.

“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”

Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, tells reporters that curing diabetes and depression is the most bizarre reason for cannibalism he’s ever heard.
 Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.

 As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.

All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail."

José Melena was performing maintenance in a 35 foot long oven at the company’s Santa Fe Springs plant when coworkers loaded it with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and turned it on. Temperatures reached 270° during a two-hour process to cook and sterilize the tuna. The body of Melena,62, was found when the oven was opened.

The company, its plant operations director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules that caused a death. The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require: implementing a safety plan; rules for workers entering confined spaces; and a procedure in place to keep machinery or equipment turned off if somebody is working in.

Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside and Florez, 42, of Whittier could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. “We remain devastated by the loss of her colleague José Melena in the tragic accident,” company said in a statement. “We disagree with and are disappointed by the charges filed by the Los Angeles Dist. Atty.’s office.”

According to the Associated Press, Florez refused to comment and messages seeking comment from Rodriguez were not immediately returned."

For those unaware of Gowdy’s many accomplishments, suffice it to say that the South Carolina conservative has been one of the more vocal critics of the Obama Administration for quite some time now.

More recently, Representative Gowdy has been a voice of reason regarding the Democrat fixation on the idea of President Trump’s supposed connections to Vladimir Putin. He’s even gone on record defending California Republican Devin Nunes from Democrat attacks on his integrity and his ability to properly investigate whether Obama spied on Trump during the 2016 campaign, via Townhall.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/02/blog-posting/trump-adviser-steve-bannon-did-not-say-its-ok-beat/,"The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple’s southern California home.

“I was wondering when this would come up,” Bannon told Politico. “It’s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump’s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we’re on the subject, I’m actually disappointed; I honestly didn’t expect them to take this long,” he said laughingly.

Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, “Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren’t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it’s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It’s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.”

But, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, “Alright, look, that’s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship, that’s the whole beauty of it. And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties,” he argued.

“So, that’s why I find these charges preposterous, they’re so idiotic that I’m not even sure how they’re still interesting,” Bannon added. “Because, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.”

“And when you’re in love, everything’s allowed, I don’t care what anyone says, when you say the words ‘I do,’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it?” he concluded.

Trump’s recent attack on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel because of his Mexican-American background prompted Sen. Lindsey Graham to round up the Republicans who have previously endorsed Donald Trump, and persuade them to take it all back.

Graham claimed that Trump’s racist remarks were “the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy.”

“If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,” Graham told The New York Times.”

Senator Graham elaborated on this during an interview with NBC News’ Hallie Jackson.

“There are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me,” he said. “But there’ll come a point in time where we’re gonna have to understand that it’s not just about the 2016 race, it’s about the future of the party and I would like to support our nominee. I just can’t.”

Donald Trump claimed that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump University case, has been biased toward him because of his Latino heritage.

“I couldn’t disagree more with a statement like that,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Sunday.

“Those kinds of comments are very serious to me,” Rep. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said to News radio WGAN. “They are completely unacceptable, and what they indicate — which is why I think this is so serious — is a lack of respect for our judicial system and for the separation of powers doctrine that is enshrined in the Constitution.”

Although many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have condemned Trump’s accusations, they continue to support him."
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/may/18/tdalliancecom/obama-statue-replacing-jefferson-davis-new-orleans/,"Workers in New Orleans dismantled the citys Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years. As workers slung a strap around the statues waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags. This historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments. The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama. It will be nice, Landrieu said, to see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege. The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars. Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors. Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night. We would have preferred it to be in the daytime, Johnson said, so everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything. Before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators  both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included Wheres Mitch? while opponents chanted, Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go. As Fox news reported earlier, the mayors plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders."

Trump has been struggling to defend his comments — widely deemed preposterous, even by St. Landry Parish educational standards — in which he claimed a man who owned as many as 300 slaves would’ve found a way to prevent the Civil War.

“People don’t realize, you know, the Civil War, if you think about it, why?” he told his interviewer, Salena Zito, a host on SiriusXM’s P.O.T.U.S. channel, who spoke to Mr. Trump for an article that was published on Sunday in The Washington Examiner.

Mr. Trump followed up on the comment in a tweet on Monday night, arguing that Jackson saw the Civil War coming and would have prevented it had he not died 16 years earlier.

The Donald, a member of the Party of Lincoln, elaborated on his recent controversial remarks about how the first Democratic U.S. president, who died 16 years before the Civil War, would have managed to avoid a war the first Republican president could not.

Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter.

Speaking to our intern Dave Robicheaux, who is paid in Facebook likes, Trump insisted Col. Harland Sanders, whom he called a “tremendous Civil War hero,” once saved an entire army at Valley Forge from certain starvation. Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter.

Robicheaux attempted to explain to Trump that Col. Sanders was born 25 years after the end of the war, that The Donald seemed to be confusing the food incident with a Biblical story about Jesus feeding the multitudes, and that Valley Forge was neither an encampment nor a battle site during the Civil War.



 

Upon being confronted with these facts, The Donald abruptly ended his interview with us, and he was last seen headed for a Confederate monument removal protest in New Orleans while screaming about fake news.

Church’s Chicken and Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen were unavailable for comment.

Incidentally, Trump has promised to deport every worker at those two companies’ restaurants if they don’t share their respective secret recipes with him.

Thomas Jefferson ELDER PATRIOT  Corrupt politicians ignore Jeffersons directive to their own detriment. Its no longer political, its personal. Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle. Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters. Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trumps America First agenda and said, If were given the White House and both houses of Congress and we dont deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly. Candidate Trump promised many things  border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and  to the extent possible  an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with? After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans  notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham  have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed. So, what gives? Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trumps promise to Drain the Swamp. As we reported yesterday, An F.B.I. agent with intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down. The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasnt interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt. Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before. One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nations loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam. Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their childrens God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they arent the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed. Donald Trumps presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force. These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trumps Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself. No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results. So why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? Its because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers. And, now that theyve been caught robbing the worlds largest bank  the U.S. treasury  they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial. Washingtons criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. Its time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you. EDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT. HERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP Impeach! Its been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word  long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obamas administration  but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, its back with a vengeance. Democrats everywhere are wildly slinging the I word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Some members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked Watergate. Now the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling on Congress to impeach Trump. Wasting no time Wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the lefts impeachment calls. MSNBC launched a Watergate ad implying Trump is Americas new Richard Nixon. Watergate. We know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions, says MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who hinted that Trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. Now, who knows where the questions will take us. But I know this: Im not going to stop asking them. Meanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around Washington, D.C., demanding all White House staffers resign Wednesday. The posters read: If you work for this White House you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of Americans tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. Also, any wars will be on your soul.  Resign now. But constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who voted for President Obama, warned impeachment enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with President Trump. Why? At this time, theres no evidence Trump actually committed a crime. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo, Turley wrote in a May 17 opinion piece posted at the Hill. Turley explained: For the first time, the Comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding Trump into the scope of the United States criminal code. However, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. Some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before Trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. Not surprising, within minutes of the New York Times report, the response was a chorus of breathless gotcha announcements. But this memo is neither the Pentagon Papers nor the Watergate tapes. Indeed, it raises as many questions for Comey as it does Trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct. A good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1503. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo. There are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. None would fit this case. That leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the due administration of justice. However, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence corruptly when Trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate.

President Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with.

 

Trump told the crowd:

 

“Police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.”


 
 

 

Obama’s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn’t be offended. Apparently it’s more important for the friends and families of criminals killed for not obeying simple commands to be coddled than it is for the families and friends of the brave men and women who run into harm’s way to save the innocent to be honored.

President Trump has righted that wrong once and for all. If the Black Lives Matter movement wants to remember their dead they can go ahead and burn down their neighborhoods. The families of fallen police will join together in laughter, grief and prayer remembering those they lost.

Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America, Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographics new docu-series The Story of Us. Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise, Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying, Goddamnit man, you were elected for this very reason, lock that bitch up! After being accused of political incorrectness, Freeman laughed again, saying Its all about being loving and caring these days, isnt it? The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else. The veteran actor, who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career, cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else. In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russias meddling in the 2016 presidential election. While insisting that the Kremlins election interference is no movie script, and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not, Morgan said, we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth. We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say, My fellow Americans. During this past election, we cam under attack by the Russian government, Freeman demands Trump to say, adding, Ive called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened."

In 2008, Maxine arranged a meeting between the Treasury Department and representatives of OneUnited bank – where her husband was a notable shareholder.

As a member of the House Financial Committee, she was able to directly contact then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to speak with him about meeting with minority-owned banks. Through her efforts, OneUnited bank was able to obtain $12 million in federal bailout funding to help cover expected losses from the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
If OneUnited had gone under, Maxine’s husband could have lost as much as $350,000. Oh, and she hired her own grandson (Mikael Moore) to work as her chief of staff.
“By contacting then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to request a meeting, allegedly for a group of minority-owned banks, but then arranging for only one bank – OneUnited, in which she had a financial interest – to attend, Rep. Waters violated House conflict of interest rules,” argues Melanie

Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).

A House rule requiring members to act in ways that reflect “credibly” on the chamber
• A House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain
• A government ethics statute banning the dispensing of “special favors”
In 2011, Maxine made it onto CREW’s list of “most corrupt” politicians. Today, at age 78, she has emerged as one of the country’s leading critics of President Trump.
Dave Hodges of The Common Sense Show calls Maxine the “poster child” for “the congressional group who vehemently opposes Donald Trump, refuses to work with him even though he’s extended his hand across the aisle, even though he’s a man that has set up apprentice programs in Maxine

Waters’ district…this country is on a collision course with civil war because of people like Maxine Waters.”

Author’s Note: Maxine has a long history of suspicious behavior. She is a crazy person who has been elected to the House 10 times. The media likes to cover her antics but has mostly avoided covering her corruption charges. This could actually be a move by Democrats to get rid of her.

Devin Kelley, who killed at least 27 people and injured many more, was one of two shooters in the church, according to eyewitnesses, who also report Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told the churchgoers “this is a communist revolution” before unloading on the congregation, reloading several times.

Sheriff Joe Tackitt confirmed to Wilson County News that there have been “multiple fatalities” and the shooter has been “taken down.”

Devin Kelley’s Facebook page stated that he was an atheist and his interests included “Civil and social rights” and “Civil rights” as well as endorsements for local Texan Democratic political candidates. His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons.

His Facebook page was taken down without explanation less than an hour after the shooting.

Deborah Wesson Gibson, aka Debbie Gibson, was named in the Washington Post article accusing Moore, and social media evidence makes clear that she is a fervent supporter of Jones and Democrats in general, and has even worked for the DNC. Wesson Gibson is a sign language interpreter, who has interpreted at rallies for both Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. She has also vocalized fervent support for Jones. Also, of course, she is a vocal opponent of Roy Moore and is clearly dedicated to him losing: This is not surprising, considering the timing of these wild stories of Moore courting and even sexually groping teenage girls when he was in his 30s. Moore has been hated passionately by the left for decades, for his consistent dedication to biblical morality. Consider how suspicious this is  a woman comes forward 39 years later with a vicious never-before-made accusation  and how is one suppose to defend oneself and prove it is a lie 39 years later? Welcome to politics in America. The establishment doesnt want Roy Moore, a man who cant be bought or bribed, to pull up their political skirts and overturn their tables of corruption and greed! Roy Moore will win big! Buckle up RINOStime to meet a real man! Kayla Moore, Roy Moores wife, in an exclusive statement to The Activist Mommy yesterday, told us that The Washington Post has been calling and harassing our friends and family, trying to find garbage. Weve had people back home telling us they are getting phone calls and when they would tell them good things, the Washington Post would ask them if they knew anything bad on him. Well, her story continues to be corroborated, as witnesses have come forward saying the Washington Post, a paper that has officially endorsed Jones, has actually been bribing people to dig up dirt on Moore! Go figure! This is exactly what Kayla claims has been happening. Roy Moore had this to say about the fabricated campaign against him: The Obama-Clinton Machines liberal media lapdogs just launched the most vicious and nasty round of attacks against me Ive EVER faced! We are in the midst of a spiritual battle with those who want to silence our message. The forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal  even inflict physical harm  if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me. I believe you and I have a duty to stand up and fight back against the forces of evil waging an all-out war on our conservative values! Our nation is at a crossroads right now  both spiritually and politically. Our children and grandchildrens futures are on the line. So rest assured  I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight! The Democrats always pull this stunt. Ever since they saw it work for the Clintons theyve been trying it every chance they get! But they completely underestimate Roy Moore and the people of God. This is a last-ditch, hail mary pass effort from the Democats to slander a man theyve hated as long as he has held public office. This fabricated story cant hold water for long!

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/15/reaganwasright/no-rosa-parks-granddaughter-didnt-praise-trump/,"Former interim head of the Democratic National Committee and long-time Democratic operative Donna Brazile wrote in an upcoming book due out this week that she feared for her life in the days and weeks after DNC tech worker Seth Rich was murdered last year as he walked home late from a local bar in Washington, D.C.

According to a tweet from Internet guru Matt Drudge, Brazile also shut her blinds so that snipers could not see her.

“Brazile writes she was haunted by the murder of DNC Seth Rich, and feared for her own life, shutting the blinds so snipers could not see her,” Drudge tweeted.

https://twitter.com/DRUDGE/status/926892115044343808

Her book, titled, “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House,” is slated to be released on Tuesday.

Why would Brazile have to fear for her life after the Rich murder — if, as we’ve been told, it was simply a robbery gone bad? Does she suspect someone of the murder?

Does she suspect the Clintons? (Related: STORM: ‘Complete panic’ at DNC after Kim Dotcom says he was in on Seth Rich’s effort to get stolen docs to WikiLeaks.)

Consider some things before you dismiss that conspiracy theory out of hand.

— As The Blaze noted, Drudge’s tweet got no small amount of attention, earning more than 13,000 retweets and tens of thousands of “likes.”

Several news websites have reported for months regarding Seth’s murder, even as the so-called “mainstream media” has all but ignored the murder. In fact, when the MSM discusses Rich at all these days, it’s usually to mock the alternative news site reporting on the latest development (like this one).

The fact that the murder impacted Brazile in such a way that she would put it in her book lends much new credence to the suspicion that his death was somehow tied to politics.

— Also, Brazile heavily criticized Hillary Clinton in her book, claiming that she essentially took over the DNC, used it as her campaign’s own personal fundraising vehicle, and only gave the organization a stipend with which to live on, NewsTarget reported last week.

When it was all said and done, Brazile said Clinton left the DNC penniless and heavily in debt.

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who ran the organization at the time, “was not a good manager,” Brazile wrote in Politico, in which she discussed Clinton’s “secret takeover” of the party. “She hadn’t been very interested in controlling the party — she let Clinton’s headquarters in Brooklyn do as it desired so she didn’t have to inform the party officers how bad the situation was.”

— When Brazile took over the DNC on an interim basis after Wasserman Schultz was fired, she discovered evidence that Clinton, the Florida congresswoman and the party leaders conspired to rig the nomination process in favor of Hillary, essentially cheating her primary challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., out of it.

She said she discovered a joint fundraising agreement “between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund, and Hillary for America.” At that point, Brazile figured out that the DNC had been subjugated by the Clinton campaign almost a full year before Hillary actually got the nomination.

“The agreement — signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to [lawyer] Marc Elias — specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised,” Brazile said.

“Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings,” she noted further.

Is Brazile’s insider, tell-all book naming Clinton as being responsible for taking over the DNC, perhaps illegally, her way of protecting herself in the wake of Rich’s murder? You could certainly make that argument.

Bowe Bergdahl, the Army sergeant facing charges of desertion, walked out of a military courtroom during a pre-trial hearing Monday and has not been seen since approximately 10:35 AM, prompting a statewide manhunt for the missing soldier. Sources inside the courtroom say that Bergdahl took only a half-full Camelbak and a long hunting knife with him as he calmly made his way to the exit during his own lawyers remarks to the judge regarding a possible plea deal. Bergdahl left behind a note stating that he intended to start a new life, that he did not believe in the legal proceedings taking place around him, and that he did not want to fight for his defense anymore. Life is way too short to care for the damnation of others, Bergdahl wrote, adding, I am ashamed to even be an American [deserter]. Three soldiers assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division were reportedly injured during the search for Bergdahl. Staff Sgt. Randy Parker was admitted to Womack Army Medical Center for a broken collarbone he received when his military police vehicle hit a roadside traffic safety device, causing it to roll over. Two unnamed Army privates were injured in an unrelated incident involving a floor buffer and rubber training rifles, which they insisted were necessary to the search effort. ISIS and Al Qaida have both claimed responsibility for the casualties, though their claims have yet to be verified. Pentagon leadership is offering an unusual reward for information on Bergdahls whereabouts: $25,000 or seven Guantanamo detainees, depending on the credibility of the information. Officials are warning the public that if they see Bergdahl, they should not attempt to approach him, since he may try to surrender and become their responsibility for the next five years."
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/20/americannewscom/no-nasa-antarctica-study-didnt-discredit-climate-c/,"According to a new study by NASA, Ancient underground streams of heated rock, called a mantle plume, might be an explanation for the instability of Antarctica’s western ice sheet, which is melting at a fairly rapid rate.

Scientists have been debating whether or not mantle plume could be responsible for western Antarctica’s instability, recent studies have shown some evidence of the claim, but some are still skeptical.

“I thought it was crazy,” Hélène Seroussi, the study’s co-author and scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a release.

“I didn’t see how we could have that amount of heat and still have ice on top of it,” Seroussi said in a statement.

NASA has said that Seroussi’s study has provided evidence of geothermal activity underneath the world largest ice sheet, but scientists were still seemingly more worried about future global warming’s effects on the ice sheet.

NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot said western ice sheet collapse is “unstoppable” and could dramatically raise sea levels.

Mantle Plume’s are rivers of thin or melted rock that makes it’s way up towards earths surface and heats the crust above it, creating lakes and rivers of melted water underneath the massive ice sheet. Seroussi’s study showed a mantle plume pushes 150 milliwatts per square meter of heat up towards the ice sheet. That’s about two to three times the heat flux of regions of the world without volcanic activity.

A 2014 University of Texas study found western Antarctica was a literal hotbed for geothermal heat. Researchers concluded that “large areas at the base of Thwaites Glacier are actively melting in response to geothermal flux consistent with rift-associated magma migration and volcanism.”

The following year, a team of U.S. scientists confirmed in a study, the large amount of geothermal heat beneath the ice sheet, “The high geothermal heat flux may help to explain why ice streams and subglacial lakes are so abundant and dynamic in this region,” the study found."

The multiple arsons have all been at facilities which house or are slated to house immigrants. One could say that someone in Sweden is mad as hell and bringing fire and brimstone to the facilities that are to be used for refugees. Seven arson fires have occurred, all of which seem to be connected with immigrant centers. Two more shelters intended for refugees went up in flames in Sweden, continuing a recent series arson of attacks that police believe are directed against arriving asylum seekers amidst the migrant crisis in Europe. In the latest incident, a childrens summer camp in the Swedish town of Eskilstuna, located about 112 kilometers west of the countrys capital of Stockholm, was engulfed in flames. The camp was planned to host about 60 asylum seekers. Around the same time, another fire started in a refugee center in the town of Munkedal in southwestern Sweden, which had already been damaged by fire earlier in another suspected arson attack last week. However, that blaze was tackled quickly and no-one was injured because the area had been cordoned off after the previous incident. Sweden has taken in more refugees than any other European country in proportion to its population. With 100,000 asylum seekers already in the country this year and another 90,000 thought to be arriving before the end of the year, the citizens of Sweden may not be as welcoming as they once were.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/22/yournewswirecom/no-proof-pope-francis-said-jesus-metaphorical/,"Pope Franciss latest controversial statement  that Jesus is metaphorical, not literal  has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny, with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the record declaring Pope Francis is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy. The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements uttered by the pontiff since he ascended the highest office in the Catholic Church, becoming the first jesuit pope in history. Since assuming the papacy in 2013, Pope Francis has operated as a mouthpiece of the globalist movement, taking every opportunity to push the New World Order agenda. A short list of Franciss most controversial statements include: PREACHING THAT JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN Pope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself, and turning into Satan. Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in its entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said. Making matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ made himself the devil, the serpent, for us, according to LOsservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican. PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE HARMFUL The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ must be avoided at all costs. Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful, the pope said during the June 25 speech. The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him. OPENLY CALLING FOR ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has a distorted vision of the world and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, for their own good. The week before he also called for a one world government and political authority, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as climate change. Speaking with Ecuadors El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control for the good of humanity. Frances Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a globalist bulldog. Vladimir Putin argued that Franciss unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Franciss own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros. Pope Franciss anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question  is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?"

The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) translated the mass calls for the murder of President Trumps youngest son on the popular Telegram app. Using the hashtag handle the son of the mule of America, the supporter, who uses the name Dak Al-Munafiqeen, Arabic for striking the hypocrites, wrote: Barron Trump goes to this school in Washington,' according to MEMRI. The post was followed by a photo of Barron Trump. To widely disseminate the call for assassination, several pro-ISIS Telegram channels have shared and forwarded the post. The rise of ISIS, funded and supported by Barack Obama, is viewed as another Obama-era failed project in in D.C., and Melania Trump has warned Obama that if his chickens come home to roost in my house, if anything happens to my son, I will scratch his eyes out. Supporting terrorists anywhere in the world can have serious and long term consequences, Melania Trump said, and if any of these psychopaths so much as lay a finger on Barron there will be hell to pay. Explaining that death threats from Islamic State terrorists have already had an impact on her son, the First Lady said This is all on the head of Barack Obama. I have always found it hard being polite to that man, considering all of the things he has done, but it will be even harder now. The influence Barack Obama had over the world was profound and deeply disturbing. Once you start looking at trouble around the United States and the world, you realize that Obamas hand is in everything. But as Melania Trump says, while Obama may be traveling the world as though he is still president, attempting to operate a shadow government to undermine President Trumps presidency, Obamas influence is steadily waning, and the terrorists he helped rise in the Middle East are in retreat. We are on the verge of taking our country back."

The order notes the un-American attitude displayed by the players, who repeatedly kneel during the National Anthem, burn flags in their locker rooms, and disrespect our country in every way imaginable.

To date, little has been done to stop players from disrespecting our military, our flag, and all they stand for, so President Trump “temporarily” revoked their 401(c)(3) status “until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.”

The NFL will be classified as a for-profit entity for tax purposes for the 2017 fiscal year, but the order allows the league to re-apply for tax-exempt status in January 2018 “if all of the problems are solved.”

A white House spokeswoman told Breitbart News that the President hopes to see all the “athletes protesting our police and our flag or otherwise using their positions to spread hate” fired and replaced with people who “love and respect America.”

The NFL has thus far refused comment."

While Puerto Rico’s Governor has praised Donald Trump’s efforts to quell the suffering of the people affected by Hurricane Maria, many of those efforts have been in vain because supplies come in to San Juan, and the mayor has been stingy with distribution.

“We simply don’t have the staff or resources  to distribute countrywide,” mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told a local newspaper, adding that “anyone can come to San Juan if they need supplies.”

Unfortunately, that explanation was not good enough for her peers. In an emergency meeting on Thursday,  the city council held an emergency meeting to initiate impeachment proceedings which begin on Monday.

Donald Trump has helped Puerto Rico and other hurricane-affected areas much more efficiently than any previous President, and Puerto Rico needs to replace their leadership with someone who understands and appreciates that before they lose the aid we aren’t even required to give them."

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/25/michael-moore/michael-moore-flubs-stats-people-killed-guns-durin/,"My Proposal to Repeal the Second Amendment and Replace It With This:
PROPOSED 28th AMENDMENT TO THE US CONSTITUTION 
“A well regulated State National Guard, being helpful to the safety and security of a State in times of need, along with the strictly regulated right of the people to keep and bear a limited number of non-automatic Arms for sport and hunting, with respect to the primary right of all people to be free from gun violence, this shall not be infringed.”
I, Michael Moore, along with all who support an end to this epidemic of gun violence, propose a new Amendment to our Constitution that repeals the ancient and outdated 2nd Amendment (which was written before bullets and revolvers were even invented), and replaces it with a new 28th Amendment that guarantees States can have State militias (a.k.a. State National Guards which are made up of citizen-soldiers who are called upon in times of natural disasters or other State emergencies), allows individuals to use guns for sport and gathering food, and guarantees everyone the right to be free of, and protected from, gun violence (i.e., the public’s safety comes ahead of an individual’s right to own and fire a gun). 
This amendment would allow states and the federal government to pass laws that would regulate gun ownership in the following manner: 
• As over 90% of gun violence is committed by men, in order for a man to purchase a gun, he must first get a waiver from his current wife, plus his most recent ex-wife, or any woman with whom he is currently in a relationship (if he’s gay, he must get the waiver from his male spouse/partner). This law has greatly reduced most spousal/domestic gun murders in Canada.
• All automatic and semi-automatic guns are banned. 
• No gun or clip can hold more than 6 bullets. 
• To activate a gun for it to be used, the trigger must recognize the fingerprint of its registered owner. This will eliminate most crimes committed with a gun as 80% of these crimes are done with a stolen gun.
• One’s guns must be stored at a licensed gun club or government-regulated gun storage facility. Believing that having a gun in your home provides you with protection is an American myth. People who die from a home invasion make up a sad but minuscule .04% of all gun murders in the US. And over a third of them are killed by their own gun that the criminal has either stolen or wrestled from them. 
• To own and operate a gun one must obtain a license (like one does to operate a car). To get a license you have to complete a gun training and safety course and pass a thorough background check.
• As nearly half of all gun deaths are suicides, mental health care must become a top national health priority and must be properly funded. And by making it more difficult to purchase a gun - and requiring its storage outside the home - easy access during a suicidal moment is denied.  
• Current restrictions placed on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), due to successful lobbying by the NRA, have prohibited them from studying the gun violence epidemic in the US. These rules need to be removed and the funding restored. Science will then be free to find out why we are ALONE among nations in killing each other at such a massive rate (hint: It’s not just the guns - it’s us as Americans). 
These are a few of the regulations that can be enacted to both protect society yet not deny hunters and sportsmen their fun. This is the sane approach that meets everyone’s needs -- everyone, that is, except those of the serial killer, the mass murderer, the violent ex-husband, the disgruntled employee or the disturbed and bullied teenager. We will never eliminate all murder; that’s been with us since Cain killed Abel. But we CAN join the community of enlightened nations where gun violence is that rare occurrence — as opposed to the daily tragedy we now suffer here in the United States of America. This can come to an end with the repeal of the 2nd Amendment and replacing it with the 28th Amendment. 
For those who believe it will be impossible to do this, let me close by sharing with you two important facts that should give us hope: 
1. We are not a country of gun nuts. 77% of all Americans do NOT own a gun! If three-quarters of the country has decided they have no need for a gun, three-quarters of the country may also decide they have no need for an archaic amendment that allows retired accountants to own 47 assault weapons. LET’S ORGANIZE THE 77%!
2. When President Obama tried to get Congress to pass simple, common sense gun control legislation after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary, polls showed 90% of the country backed him! But the NRA beat him. LET’S ORGANIZE THE 90%!
We can start with the upcoming midterm election. Let every candidate know: If you take NRA money, we will 
remove you from office. 
Then do it."

The situation has become critical, Kurz said. Soros is throwing everything he has behind his push for global control. Misinformation and media manipulation has already increased exponentially overnight. We have no room for complacency. Kurz, a self-described truther who says he was red pilled by the 9/11 film Loose Change, claims that he understands the Soros agenda, and there is no way in hell this country will be his fifth victim. It is understood the Austrian chancellor is referring to the number of national economies Soros has crashed in order to gain enormous personal profit and political influence. Asked why he was banning George Soross Open Society Foundations, Kurz said, Because its 2017. The news that Soros has released 75% of his vast fortune to push his political and social agenda has caused shockwaves around the world, with many democratically elected leaders expressing fear that the sheer weight of his billions, used to buy politicians and journalists, will be difficult to fight against. Kurz agrees. This is why he has taken fast action. The specter of Soros is the greatest challenge humanity is facing in the world in 2017. He is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming his blood funnel into anything that smells like money, using this money to corrupt politicians, journalists and the public sector, and attempting to create the world in his image.

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time theres been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern, said Dr. Polowotski. Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution.

This shocking report impelled food inspectors to investigate the matter further. What is even more shocking, allegedly they have found human and horse meat in the freezers of an Oklahoma City McDonald’s meat factory. In addition, inspectors found human meat in several trucks on their way to deliver the burgers to the fast food restaurants.

There are other reports that suggest that upon inspecting McDonald’s factories and food restaurants throughout the country, food authorities found human meat in even 90% of the locations, while horse meat was found in 65% of the locations.

Lloyd Harrison is FBI agent, and for Huzler he stated: “The worst part is that it’s not only human meat, it’s child meat. The body parts were found across the US factories and were deemed too small to be adult body parts. This is truly horrible.”

When it comes to cannibalism it originated thousands of years ago. Actually there are few tribes today that still practice it as a cultural cult.

Unfortunately we can conclude that cannibalism is present in the modern world. In 2013 a North Korean man was sentenced to death for killing his children for food. In America the people who supported eating human meat, Jeffrey Dahmer and Albert Fish, were proclaimed insane.

After these investigations and breakthroughs, the public and consumers are expecting answers from McDonald’s fast food restaurants. The question is how long has this human meat been used? Where did those children come from?

It is fact that McDonald’s facilities are under thorough investigation and authorities are hopeful to have all of these questions answered as soon as possible. Well, our advice is at the meantime to avoid these places and their food altogether!

The word Our in March For Our Lives refers to students. From Wikipedia: March For Our Lives was a student-led demonstration in support of tighter gun control that took place on March 24, 2018, in Washington, D.C., with over 800 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world. Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation. Never Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement For survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting using the hashtag #NeverAgain. The MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky. Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place. A source of European researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D.C. Police Department concerning the permit for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C. Dammegards source received the following email from Officer Scott C. Earhardt of the Homeland Security Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department and forwarded it to Dammegard: Good morning, In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018.

Heres a screenshot I took from page 6 of the 65-page document: Here are some facts: The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (MSD) High School occurred on February 14, 2018. A day after the shooting, on February 15, 2018, MSD students formed the group, Never Again MSD. On March 24, 2018, March For Our Lives demonstrations took place in Washington, D.C. (and other cities). Among the organizers of March For Our Lives is Never Again MSD , which had not existed before February 15 . The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department received a permit application for March For Our Lives demonstration  several months prior to the actual event. Questions: How can Never Again MSD apply for a permit several months BEFORE the group had even been formed? How can an application be made for a permit for a March For Our Lives demonstration several months BEFORE the Parkland MSD school shooting that galvanized MSD students to form the Never Again MSD group that organized the demonstration? See also: UPDATE (March 31, 2018): There are claims that the email from Officer Earhardt is bogus, and that theres a permit application for March For Our Lives in D.C. which is dated February 20, 2018, but which is an application to the National Park Service, not Metro PD. See The curious ever-changing dates of March For Our Lives permit application. I, therefore, asked Professor James Fetzer for the original Earhardt email. Fetzer had obtained the screenshot of the email from Ole Dammegard, whose friend was the person who originally contacted Officer Earhardt about the permit. I just received an email from Mr. Dammegard, with an attachment of the original Earhardt email, indicating the date on which the email was sent to Dammegards friend who, understandably, prefers to remain anonymous. I find the above email from Officer Earhardt to be credible. I also have confidence in the integrity of Professor Fetzer and Mr. Dammegard, neither of whom profits from counterfeiting the email  which is something we cant say about those people who instigate false-flag mass-shooting incidents like Parkland. In the meantime, Professor Fetzer had placed a phone call to Officer Earhardt to confirm the latters email. When we hear from Officer Earhardt, I will update this post with that information. Update (April 5, 2018): Officer Earhardt has given 4 different dates for when Metro PD received the permit application.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/03/trump-talks/misleading-headline-says-terrorist-attack-trump-pr/,"Since President Trump has been in office, the left has been in an uproar and doing their best to create as much civil unrest as possible. These angry leftists in their rage over the fact that Trump trounced Hillary in the 2016 presidential election have been fanning the flames of division in our country and promoting violence against the president. Over the last year, several liberal Democrat politicians and unhinged Hillary Clinton fanatics have made explicit death threats against President Trump which has kept the Secret Service on high alert. Now, over this holiday weekend, President Trump and his family had an urgent situation unfold that had the police rushing to the scene, and has everyone wondering when the violence will end?

There was a time in our nation’s history that no matter who won the presidential election, the American people and the loser of the election would band together behind the elected president for the good of the nation. However, those days seem far behind after the last eight years of Barack Obama and his divisive nature that has thrust our country into constant turmoil. Now, instead of those in the Democrat party cheering on President Trump to ensure that he does a job well done for the American people, they have been actively doing their best to sabotage his presidency. For instance, over the last year, the left has been doing whatever they can to oust Trump from office with their phony Russian collusion story, and since that has not worked the way, they had hoped they are turning to threats of physical violence.

Threats of violence toward President Trump is not anything new in this “brave new world” of politics, in fact just earlier last month, Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi promoted acts of violence against Trump during a town hall meeting he attended. Then last year, Missouri Democratic State Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal posted on Facebook that she hoped that President Trump was assassinated, are you starting to notice a pattern here?

So, it should come as no surprise that civilians in the country would attack Trump, his family, and now his property, which is what happened over the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

Here is more from Local 10 News:

“Someone in West Palm Beach, Florida, took the term “paint the town red” a bit too literal on Saturday night.

The entrance to Trump International Golf Club, the president’s course du jour while at the so-called Winter White House in Mar-a-Lago, had new decoration on Saturday evening in the form of red paint splattered all over one of the entrance signs.

The red paint was tossed haphazardly on the left entrance with a can of paint visible on the ground. It’s unclear exactly when the vandalism happened.

Two vans from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Department were on scene investigating the apparent vandalism Saturday at about 10 p.m.

Neither the U.S. Secret Service nor the sheriff’s department responded to inquiries from ABC NewsSaturday night.

Donald Trump spent Saturday at Trump International Golf Club, according to the Tampa Bay Times, though it’s not clear if he was on the course. Trump was at the club on Friday as well. The president is usually secretive about whether he actually hits the links or not.

Fox News host Sean Hannity and PGA golfer Dustin Johnson spent time with Trump at the golf club on Saturday as well, according to Palm Beach Post reporter George Bennett. Donald Trump Jr. shared a photo on Instagram of his daughter Kai with Johnson, the current world No. 1 player, and 2016 U.S. opener winner, on the course.

It’s not clear whether any of the Trumps were at the club when the vandalism occurred.

Trump opened the golf club in 1999, the first of what is now many courses in his portfolio. According to ABC News’ analysis of public records of Trump’s schedule, the president spent 109 days at one of his properties in his first year in office.

The president’s Mar-a-Lago estate is just a 15-minute drive from Trump International.”

Now, while this attack on Trump’s property is disgusting, it is not the first time it has been done. Earlier last year, another of Trump’s hotels were vandalized when a light was projected onto the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, several anti-Trump messages.

Here is more from Business Insider:

“Several messages were displayed in a bluish light. The Washington Post reported that the words “PAY TRUMP BRIBES HERE” appeared above the entrance to the building, along with an arrow pointing toward the entrance of the hotel.

Another projection read, “EMOLUMENTS WELCOME” — an apparent reference to the emoluments clause that became a point of contention amid arguments about Trump’s financial conflicts of interest in the early days of his presidency. The “emoluments” message was displayed over a backdrop of Turkey’s flag.”

Whether or not you agree with the president in office there is a proper way to air your grievances but to destroy private property is not the way. One can only hope that the people who did this to Trump’s resort will be found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law to send a clear message to others who may think this behavior is acceptable when it most certainly isn’t."

Everything that protects America from conquest, such as immigration laws, vetting of refugees and voter IDs is racist to corrupt Chuck.
Obviously feeling a threat to the Democrats’ system of voter fraud that is the foundation of every election they win, the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared that Democrats will attempt to use a “must-pass” bill to dissolve President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission if he doesn’t end it ‘voluntarily.”

Why are you so opposed to only citizens voting or exposing fraudulent voter rolls, Chuck? Afraid the American people are going to find out what you’ve been up to, the real reason you wanted illegal aliens to have driver’s licenses? States have gone out of their way to offer free IDs to residents to avoid any perception of discrimination and made them exceedingly easy to get. That’s not good enough.

Schumer accused President Trump in a Thursday op-ed of being  a white supremacist and that the only appropriate way for him to prove that Schumer is lying about him is to disband the voter fraud commission. Are there not white people voting illegally too Chuck or do you know who they are because you’re orchestrating it and they’re all non-whites?
Schumer wrote, “If the president wants to truly show that he rejects the discrimination agenda of the white supremacist movement, he will rescind the executive order that created this commission.” He followed that disgusting display up with some equally disgusting Thursday tweets.
Schumer wrote, “On where we go after #Charlottesville: It’s time to end the assault on voting rights. My latest on @Medium.” He also tweeted, “And if @POTUS won’t disband the Election Integrity Commission, @SenateDems will try to do it on a must-pass bill in September.”
Schumer plans to push back hard against the effort to clean up the fraud Democrats are benefitting from, calling for public hearings on voting rights in September when Congress is back in session. If Republicans are smart they’ll turn it into a hearing into voter fraud and expose Schumer and his criminal Democrat cronies.

The White House characterizes the commission as studying the vulnerabilities in the U.S. voting systems. It planned to evaluate voter suppression and voter fraud, both in terms of registration and actual voting.
The most dishonest of politicians since Obama, a noteworthy distinction, Schumer described the commission, saying of the commissions limited actions to date, “They are a ruse. Their only intention is to disenfranchisevoters. This is how the appalling failure to use the right words and stand up to hate in the aftermath of Charlottesville is made in the form of policy; they are two edges of the same sword.”
Yes, Schumer did just call both President Trump and his policies racist. Why even bother speaking to this ass. Change the Senate rules to a simple majority for passage and get a good 18 months of legislative activity in before the midterms. Those successes will breed more votes and success at the polls.

Trash like Schumer are obstructionists strictly intent on defeating President Trump and conservatives in service to the globalist agenda. He’s not interested in America or Americans and he loathes our Constitution.Schumer wrote, “If the president wants to truly show that he rejects the discrimination agenda of the white supremacist movement, he will rescind the executive order that created this commission.” He followed that disgusting display up with some equally disgusting Thursday tweets."
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/09/blog-posting/no-evidence-websites-claim-about-microchipping-rec/,"(Natural News) Late last month, it was reported that a Wisconsin company called Three Square Market was planning on surgically implanting microchips underneath the skin of its employees for convenience purposes. Three Square Market CEO Todd Westby told KSTP, the Twin Cities ABC affiliate station, that the microchip implants are the next big thing thats inevitably going to happen, and we want to be a part of it. Westby explained that the microchip would be capable of doing a number of different things, from allowing people to purchase food in the break room by simply scanning their hand, to serving as an electronic key to open doors and access computers. The microchips use Radio Frequency Identification technology (RFID) to function, which also happens to be the technology used when you pay for items using your iPhone or Android device. We foresee the use of RFID technology to drive everything from making purchases in our office break room market, opening doors, use of copy machines, logging into our office computers, unlocking phones, sharing business cards, storing medical/health information, and used as payment at other RFID terminals, said the Three Square Market CEO in a statement. Eventually, this technology will become standardized allowing you to use this as your passport, public transit, all purchasing opportunities, etc. But while Todd Westby may be enthusiastic about the use of this microchip technology in everyday life, thousands or even millions of others are no doubt concerned. The idea of implanting microchips underneath the skin in order to store information regarding your health and finances sounds like something straight out of George Orwells famous book 1984. Even if the chips do not have a GPS system and its impossible to track those that have them embedded underneath their skin, the overall concept is still unnerving. Americans are conditioned to embrace individual liberty, and microchip implants force them to embrace the exact opposite of that. Noelle Chesley, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, believes that the use of microchips is only going to become more common in the not-so-distant future. It will happen to everybody, she explained. But not this year, and not in 2018. Maybe not my generation, but certainly that of my kids. In fact, the idea of using microchips in order to track the financial situations of welfare recipients has already been suggested by one politician in Finland. According to Sputnik News, a member of Finlands conservative Finn Party recently recommended implanting satellite-tracking chips inside of welfare recipients in response to news that some recipients continued to receive payments after leaving the country to fight for the Islamic State. Pasi Maenranta, the politician who suggested the idea, argued on his Facebook page that in order to receive welfare payments from Kela, one has to tell exact data about your location using your personal code, read by a satellite. Maenranta also noted that it would be possible to implant microchips beneath the skin of all those traveling overseas who for example receive medical welfare from Kela, also known as the Social Insurance Institution. But regardless of how good the intentions may be, there are still a lot of questions that must be answered before the people of our country and elsewhere embrace the use of surgically implanted microchips. Can they ever be turned off or removed? Who exactly will have access to your location should the microchip be equipped with GPS technology? And if the microchips contain personal information regarding health and finances, will it be possible for that information to be hacked and potentially sold by a third party? If Americans are serious about holding on to our Fourth Amendment right to privacy, then these are questions that we should all demand be answered before more advancements in microchip technology are made.

Aldrin, the second man on the moon, and four others gave accounts of their sightings under strict lab conditions.

He, Al Worden, Edgar Mitchell and Gordon Cooper all took part in the study conducted by the Institute of BioAcoustic Biology in Albany, Ohio.

Aldrin, 88, claimed he was a spaceship on his way to the moon, adding: “There was something out there that was close enough to be observed… sort of L-shaped.”

The tests, reportedly more reliable than standard lie detector tests, showed he was telling the truth, the Daily Star reported.

Apollo 15 pilot Worden, 85, and Apollo 14’s Mitchel also claimed to have seen UFOs while Cooper says he actually tried to chase a cluster of objects.

the second man on the moon

Tests analysing their voice patterns suggested they were also telling the truth about their strange encounters.

Aldrin answered questions about his alleged encounter with alien life on a Reddit Q&A with fans last week.

In one post he said: “On Apollo 11 in route to the Moon, I observed a light out the window that appeared to be moving alongside us.

“There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world.

“It was either the rocket we had separated from or the four panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket.

“It was not an alien. Extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence. That’s what Carl Sagan said.

“There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. The probability is almost certain that there is life somewhere in space.

“It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today.”

On July 21, 1969, Neil Armstrong made history by becoming the first person to set foot on the earth’s moon.

Upon landing, he is famously quoted as saying: “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”

Buzz was on the same mission, Apollo 11, as Neil Armstrong and soon followed in his footsteps – making him the second man on the moon.

In total, Neil and Buzz were on the lunar surface for only 21 hours, 36 minutes and 21 seconds.

Pete Conrad was a moon walker on the Apollo 12 mission, which launched on November 14, 1969. He was partnered by Alan Bean.

“White people are so 1960’s. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that they will be blended out by the time I am 30,” a recording of Obama’s speech shared on Snapchat said. “Imagine a world without white people.” Obama was of course referring to the scientific belief that if whites continue to breed at low rates in America while others races continue to breed at current rates, white babies will be virtually nonexistent in our country by 2038.

A post quoting Obama was shared more than 14,000 times with a reach of nearly 1 million Americans, which forced Harvard to take action.

“This sort of attack against any race is uncalled for,” Harvard Dean Cain Markholder said in a statement Sunday. “Ms. Obama has been informed she is suspended pending an investigation into her statement.” But it gets worse for Obama — Markholder says that if a disciplinary board finds her guilty, she will “forfeit her grade for the exam” which is worth 47% of her grade according to one of the students who shared video of her racist hate speech-filled attack on whites.

The dean notes that punishment for racist attacks like this can lead to “expulsion,” but we’re sure that her dad will once again bail her out of trouble."

When Willis was asked about his opinion on Trumps presidency so far he said: I think that hes doing great. In fact, he just might be the best US President ever. Fallon then asked him if he was serious about this statement because it would definitely sound like an exaggeration to many people. Willis responded: Yeah Im being serious about this. Trump has always been a winner and to be honest I cant think of a better man to lead America at this moment. Bruce Willis is one the few conservatives in Hollywood who are not afraid to express their support for President Trump. He has always been a fan of Trump and everything that he represents  a successful businessman and a role model for every young American. Willis added: Trump has a winning mentality and I believe that every American can identify with that. He is the guy that we need right now and I think that we should all settle our differences and support him. However Willis is bothered by the attitude of many American politicians and stars who spend their time criticizing Trump. He said: Before every election so far there were debates and fighting between candidates. But, once we had a winner everybody just stood behind the elected President. Now we see that the fighting and conflict continue long after the 2016 election. I dont like that. It doesnt look good. If you dont like him go to Canada or something. Do you agree with him?

Thats the tax for not having enough melanin in their skin, ergo gaining from white privilege. Yes, once more white America suffers the guilt of people who havent been slaves or oppressed in any way. The Congressional Black Circus, most more wealthy that 99 percent of our readers race-bait in order to keep the gravy train running. The Washington Examiner reported, Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) and the CBC have reissued a bill to study reparations for Americas past sin of slavery. For Conyers, this twenty-year long crusade, reemerges annually. And even with a black president in office, he couldnt get it passed. These clowns expect to tax white people for nothing more than being white. Well, this white chick is not paying any tax every other American must pay. Trending: Finally a Legit Poll: Obama the Worst President since WWII Moreover, before some bleeding heart pansies say they are willing to pay the black tax, I suggest getting a DNA test on all of the CBC. Have you seen these people? Many, and I do mean MANY are not black at all, but dangerously close to white themselves. I want to have Ancestry.com run DNA test on every member of the CBC. I bet the results will be shocking. Look at Conyers. Hardly a black person I know wouldnt say this man has white people hair. Conyers makes TAN look black. Look at the waves; then look at his complexion. Id be willing to bet that Conyers is more white than he is black. He may very well be Dolezals father, for goodness sake. Then lets test white people too. Perhaps we may find that many of us have been missing out on reparations, and we can get in line. Maybe when idiots black Leftists like Conyers find out that almost the whole country has black blood, they will drop this nonsense. You can bet if we required DNA, the CBC would drop this, as many of them put their Dolezal and Elizabeth Warren cards back in their purses and wallets. Its not about what you look like, but your DNA. Since many blacks in America descended from slaves, many of them have white blood. And while we are on the subject, which white ancestors are to blame? Was it the less than 2 percent of whites who actually had slaves? Or what about the blacks who owned black slaves in America? Oy! That gets dicey, doesnt it. The Root magazine reported that black Americans owned black slaves from at least the mid-17th century. Further, lets not forget Africa. The African tribal chiefs that sold their own people to the white slave traders in the first place, now didnt they. This is the latest Democrat attempt to reverse black poverty, at the expense of the boogeyman. For decades, Leftist have pretended to care about poverty by giving out other peoples money. It hasnt worked because government handouts are a short term solution. Long term success depends on teaching those in poverty how to lift themselves out of it through education, entrepreneurship, and a work ethic; things Leftists dont teach. Slavery was outlawed in America over 150 years ago, thanks to Republican white people. Further, not every white Americans ancestors participated in this horrendous trade, and in fact many came to America afterward. Black Leftists are free to join the rest of America and pursue opportunityequally."

Although this may not be true, those who have looked into it know that strange anomalies have surrounded the Moon for decades. Contemplation without investigation is the height of ignorance, a quote attributed to Einstein holds true here. If you actually do some independent research, you might be quite shocked with what you find, especially when it comes to the credibility of the sources. As far back as 1970, two well-respected members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Michael Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov, created a hypothesis suggesting that the Moon is a spaceship created by unknown beings. Fast forward to today, and we have former high-ranking members of the military and intelligence agencies sharing their knowledge with regards to strange things that are happening on the Moon. A few examples are listed in the articles linked below. Take for example Timothy Good, one of the worlds leading UFO researchers, who has lectured at universities, schools, and many organizations, including the Institute of Medical Laboratory Sciences, the Royal Canadian Military Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Naval Air Reserve Branch, the House of Lords All-Party UFO Study Group, and the Oxford and Cambridge Union societies. Good says that a former member of MI6 revealed her conversation with Neil Armstrong at a NASA conference, when he confirmed there were other spacecraft on the Moon when Apollo 11 landed in 1969. Armstrong also confirmed the CIA was behind the coverup. He also goes into more detail about it in this 2013 lecture. Dr. John Brandenburg, the Deputy Manager of the Clementine Mission to the Moon, which was part of a joint space project between the Ballistic Missile Defence Organization (BMDO) and NASA, has also made some fascinating revelations.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/20/yournewswirecom/hillary-clinton/,"A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel. The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the best way to help Israel. Newobserveronline.com reports: The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clintons private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012. The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian governmentand specifically to do this because it is in Israels interests. The best way to help Israel deal with Irans growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad, Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying. Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Irans atom bomb program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to justify destroying Syria in the name of Israel. She specifically links Irans mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Irans atom bomb program threatens Israels monopoly on nuclear weapons in the Middle East. If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other adversaries of Israel such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to go nuclear as well, all of which would threaten Israels interests. Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed. Irans nuclear program and Syrias civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about  but cannot talk about  is losing their nuclear monopoly. An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today. If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself. It is, Clinton continues, the strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israels security. This would not come about through a direct attack, Clinton admits, because in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel this has never occurred, but through its alleged proxies. The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israels leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests. Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israels security, it would also ease Israels understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly. Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted. Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad and his family with violence is the right thing to do: In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria. With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assads mind. The email provesas if any more proof was neededthat the US government has been the main sponsor of the growth of terrorism in the Middle East, and all in order to protect Israel. It is also a sobering thought to consider that the refugee crisis which currently threatens to destroy Europe, was directly sparked off by this US government action as well, insofar as there are any genuine refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria. In addition, over 250,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, which has spread to Iraqall thanks to Clinton and the Obama administration backing the rebels and stoking the fires of war in Syria. The real and disturbing possibility that a psychopath like Clintonwhose policy has inflicted death and misery upon millions of peoplecould become the next president of America is the most deeply shocking thought of all. Clintons public assertion that, if elected president, she would take the relationship with Israel to the next level, would definitively mark her, and Israel, as the enemy of not just some Arab states in the Middle East, but of all peace-loving people on earth."

This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Muellers Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo. Denzel affirmed, If the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it! Denzel Washington, who has been nominated for Best Actor for the film Roman J. Israel, Esq. (his 8th total Oscar nomination), didnt pull any punches on the revelations of the released memo, stating: They would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections. When a reporter then asked Denzel Washington if he felt the memo released by Congress on Friday was reliable, he responded, Hell yeah, its reliable. We dont need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly whats happened here. We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports, and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton. You guys cant see what is wrong with this? Youre kidding me. Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign? Denzel Washington then later called out individual reporters and media outlets for never publishing anything negative about the Democrat Party, and subsequently hiding their scandals from any in-depth news output. Denzel continued, I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But youve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided the creation of an Orwellian Police State. We couldnt agree more, and we thank god for Donald Trump every day, which has been our sentiment all along here at Brainstain. We also wonder why the mainstream news media is now trying to downplay the severity of the memo, as if it didnt constitute complete treason?

New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, cant be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat. Where do these horses come from? While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obamas watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations. Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico  and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well. Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore. Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses. Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Dont let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it  because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.

It’s been a mostly frosty night on the left side of the House for tonight’s State of the Union, but when President Donald Trump said that he wants to end chain migration, some Democrats were incensed.

During the president’s remarks on immigration, he said that the “fourth pillar” of his immigration reform plan “protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration.”

Not only did Democrats object to Trump’s concept of the “nuclear family” – a term which alienates a vast swath of families in the United States – but they also fundamentally disagreed with the notion that people should not be allowed to immigrate with their extended families.

“Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children,” Trump expounded. “This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future.”

Democrats were also nonplussed by Trump’s assertion that the plan was a “down-the-middle compromise”: Via

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/02/eco-news/story-nfl-lawyer-said-super-bowl-rigged-and-was-mu/,"An NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years, has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is rigged. Dan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an gangland-style execution, hours after blowing the whistle on the rigged Super Bowl backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis. Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series, along with one other man, believed to be a close friend. Goodes, an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football Leagues Park Avenue headquarters, had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis, working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sundays Super Bowl featuring the two teams. However Goodes went off-script in Minneapolis and was physically removed from the premises by security staff, but not before publicly condemning the NFL as totally corrupt and claiming the Super Bowl is fixed. Telling reporters that he is a football fan first and foremost, and a lawyer second, Goodes said Football in America in 2018 doesnt need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesnt pass the sniff test. I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I cant stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me wont allow it. Football in America wont recover from this. Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an gangland-style execution in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story. According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a rigged game that will earn maximum revenue for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth. This is the biggest scam in sports history, Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out. How do I know its scripted? Ive read the damn thing. You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes cant be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they dont care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesnt matter to the franchise owners. It doesnt matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here. The sad thing is that its legal. Can you believe that? Its legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me. Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as entertainment, Goodes said The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine. The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as entertainment rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate franchises they would want you to believe. In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing entertainment in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws. The only other sport that occupies this legal position is the WWE. How are games rigged? According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system. Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesnt happen. Are they that good? Hell, no theyre not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every single game. So how is it fixed? Refs manipulate who wins for the overall benefit of the NFL. The NFL splits its revenue between teams, so do the players care? Im telling you now, they dont care. What player would care if they get an extra $5 million when the salary cap goes up thanks to more revenues built on scripted outcomes? The players have an awareness about it and the refs also make penalty calls in key situations to manipulate the score and outcomes. How come zero players call out the refs? How come zero coaches call out the refs, despite the outrageous calls that change the results of games? Everyone is on the same side, thats why. These NFL refs are part-time employees of the NFL. They sign the tightest contracts you will ever see in your life. They work for the league, period. They are bound by NFL mandated gag orders. They cant open their mouth and say a single word to the media or their ass is toast. Why doesnt anyone speak out? According to Goodes, people do speak out. But nobody wants to hear. Remember the Harbaugh Bowl? Arthur Blank, the Atlanta Falcons owner, admitted the results were fixed. It is predetermined that these two teams would be here, I was my team was selected to be in the Super Bowl. And the NFL admitted it themselves in court. We are entertainment and we can manage outcomes as we see fit. Were exempt. Super Bowl LII will be the 52nd Super Bowl and the 48th modern-era NFL championship game, contested between New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday."

This comes as the federal agency Housing and Urban Development is rolling out its nationwide ban on smoking in public housing, and just a few years after many states have outlawed smoking in beaches and public parks.

Facebook  Twitter  Pinterest  Google+ In America, its very difficult to be simply paternalistic, Ronald Bayer, co-director of the Center for the History and Ethics of Public Health at Columbia Universitys Mailman School of Public Health, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. American values of privacy and freedom make it very difficult to prohibit anything as mainstream as tobacco, even if its to save the lives of smokers.

The World Health Organizations Framework Convention on Tobacco Control established a method called MPOWER in 2008 that aims to end the global tobacco epidemic, which kills over 7 million people each year. The way to do this is not by banning it all at once, but instead by monitoring use and prevention, protecting citizens from second-hand smoke, offering ways to help people quit, warning people of the dangers of smoking, enforcing bans on advertising, and raising taxes on tobacco products.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/12/blog-posting/no-obama-not-facing-indictment-spying-trump/,"24 Shares Share Tweet Share Email After months of the liberal media ridiculing Trump over his claim that Obama spied on him during the election, Trump finally got vindication this week. America learned the truth on Tuesday that Obama did in fact unconstitutionally spy on Trump throughout the presidential election, leaving Barack Obama with his pants down yet again. Now former intelligence officer Lt. Col Tony Shaffer just revealed that Obamas wiretapping was not only a federal crime, but says that the results of this investigation will likely result in Obama being brought up on FELONY CHARGES. The colonels dire prediction about Obamas future is sending shock-waves through the black hearts of liberals all across America today, as its now thrown a monkey wrench into Obamas plans to stage his political comeback this fall. In a a recent interview with Trending Today USA, Lt. Col Tony Shaffer called Obamagate an order of magnitude even bigger than the Watergate scandal because the incident included using nation-state resources for purposes of political gain. When asked if Obama could be arrested for violating the law, he said that it would be the first time a former president could be indicted for a felony. I think it is very possible that he acted outside of the scope of his duties, responsibilities and authorities to turn the resources of a nation-state on a candidate. This is, as Ive said before, soviet-dictator level wrongdoing, he added. Shaffer said that Obama using government resources to spy on Trump was for the sole purpose of getting Hillary into office, as Obama hoped the wiretapping would produce enough dirt on Trump to sabotage his presidential run. Given Shaffers lengthy military career, his rise to the top of the American intelligence community, and his current senior position at the prestigious London Center for Policy Research, his prediction about Obama shouldnt be scoffed at. Being brought up on felony charges would completely destroy Obamas plan of making his political comeback this year, as hed be trying to figure out a way to keep himself out of prison instead of spending his hours obsessing with ways to bring Trump down. The Hill reported on just how extensive Obamas spying truly was, as this unconstitutional move wasnt just limited to listening in on Trumps calls. They reported: If these reports are accurate, it means U.S. intelligence agencies secretly surveilled at least a half dozen Trump associates. And those are just the ones we know about. Besides Manafort, the officials include former Trump advisers Carter Page and Michael Flynn. Last week, we discovered multiple Trump transition officials were incidentally captured during government surveillance of a foreign official. We know this because former Obama adviser Susan Rice reportedly admitted unmasking, or asking to know the identities of, the officials. Spying on U.S. citizens is considered so sensitive, their names are supposed to be hidden or masked, even inside the government, to protect their privacy. In May, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates acknowledged they, too, reviewed communications of political figures, secretly collected under President Obama. After getting away with whatever the hell he wanted over the past 8 years and wiping his butt with the Constitution, it looks like Obamas cockiness might just be his undoing. He might have gotten away with his antics in the past, but things are vastly different now that Obama doesnt have all his minions blocking all investigations into his crimes, as was the case when he was president. If this colonels predication is in fact true, Obamas little plan to keep trolling Trump with his little shadow government from the headquarters of his D.C. home could soon be coming to an abrupt end. How poetic would it be that after spending 8 years pandering to terrorists and trying to destroy America that Obama could live out the rest of his life behind bars in an orange jumpsuit? Sounds like perfect justice for America! SHARE this story if you want to see Obama behind bars for the rest of his treasonous life!"

After learning that President Obama ordered the Department of Education’s library division to divert more than $8 million in funds to a fund to build the next Presidential Library, Trump wrote the order rescinding it and putting the money into improving the education of privately held charter schools instead.

Michelle Obama, who was going to get a free home on the top floor of the new building that was rumored to be a replica of the White House Residence, was reportedly so upset at the news that she canceled her plans to attend the annual Kumonawanna pig roast in Honolulu.

Obama will have no recourse but to try to raise the money or pay for the project himself, but without the big donors and connections of a great Republican president, he’ll probably be stuck buying something that looks like a Bush’s guest home.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/19/conservative-daily-post/no-trump-did-not-declare-george-soros-security-thr/,"Its no surprise that one of the most hated people in the entire world is George Soros. This liberal billionaire has used his massive wealth and resources to essentially control the Democratic Party. Which is why if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, she would have been listening to Soros. When youre done imaging that nightmare scenario, its important to realize that the fight isnt over yet. Hillary might have lost the election, but Soros is still out there, mobilizing and planning more moves that seek to dismantle the Donald Trump presidency. Thats why Trump finally had enough and is going to charge Soros as a threat to national security in the United States. Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, its been a long time coming for this order. Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about any and all files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine. I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. Nearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did undermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine. Due to Soross illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives. Clearly that is interfering in the process. So why didnt President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? Its because Soros flooded Obama and Hillarys Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party? Soros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared it is the central focus of my life and a matter of life and death to push his influence on the American people and our democracy. While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillarys highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time. Now that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying democracy is now in crisis. Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible. During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent. These protesters started riots, went up against the police force, and generally made life difficult for law-abiding citizens. Then came a report that Soros was paying these protesters around $15 an hour to protest, and they would have their expenses paid for. It didnt just stop at the Black Lives Matter protests either. There were several protests against Trump during the election season that turned violent. Again, another report circulated that protesters were getting paid to cause as much destruction as possible. Considering that one of these protests actually shut down a speech that Trump had planned to make, its safe to say that they were effective at the time. Not to mention that these people were endangering other people around them and creating a lot of problems for the police forces that were assigned to them. Its about time that Trump did something against Soros. This man has been responsible for funding protests that have turned violent in the United States. He has been responsible for attempting to control the Democrats through his donations to the Party. This man is a menace to society, and Trump is finally labeling Soros like he should be: a National Security Threat. Other nations are starting to do something against Soros as well. Hungary became the first nation to come forward and do what they could to bring down Soros. Hungary said that they will use all the tools at its disposal to sweep out various NGOs that are tied to Soros. In other words, his wealth wont be able to influence government positions anymore. Again, Soros has done what he could to help finance and protest against Trumps inauguration. A report came out that showed he was directly tied to over 50 groups that were set to protest the inauguration of Trump. If he is tied to that many groups, then that is a lot of money invested in people just to protest something. Share this article to show that Trump is finally going to label Soros for what he is, and that is a threat to the security of the United States. Trump was able to do this thanks to Obamas Executive Order back in 2014. Considering all the damage that Soros has done to the United States through his funding of protests, this was a long time coming."

Local media reported he was an 18-year-old former student of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, north of Miami. While some teachers said he demonstrated warning signs, Superintendent Robert Runcie said he was not aware of any specific warnings the school district had received regarding the shooter.

An Instagram page apparently belonging to Cruz showed pictures of guns and knives.

Superintendent: ‘Numerous fatalities’ in school shooting

One student told WJXT that “everyone predicted” the shooting, which killed multiple people, according to police.

“Honestly, a lot of people were saying it was gonna be him,” the unnamed student told the news station. He said kids joked around that the student would be the one to “shoot up the school.”

“It turns out, everyone predicted it,” the student said, adding the suspect knew the layout of the school.

“Yeah, he was on the third floor. He knows the school layout, he knows where everyone would be at as of right now,” the student said. “He’s been with us in fire drills, he’s prepared for this stuff.”

Sheriff Scott Israel said he didn’t know why the student left the school, as he was not currently enrolled.

A teacher at the high school told the Miami Herald the suspect was seen as a potential threat in the past, as he allegedly threatened students last year.

“We were told last year that he wasn’t allowed on campus with a backpack on him,” Jim Gard, who claimed to be a former teacher of the suspect’s, told the Herald. “There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus.”

One student told WSVN he “stayed clear of [the suspect] most of the time.”

“My time in alternate school, I did not want to be with him at all because I didn’t want to cause any conflict with him, because of the impression he gave off,” the student said of the shooter.

They had people in there anointing it with oil and praying everywhere. After the First Lady had finished removing pagan and demonic items, only one thing was left  a cross on the wall. The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography. Because apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era, Begley said. The White House pastor then related that the First Lady said, Youve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests  she wanted respected Christian leaders  to go in and cleanse the White House or, I will not spend one night in it.

We havent ever  the guys got flaws, we all do. But at least he is humble enough and recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the prayer. Pastor Begley made his remarks during the Feb. 2 edition of Weekend Vigilante, hosted by Sheila Zilinsky. In his book, My Life, former president Bill Clinton confessed that he and Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where an alleged spirit arrived, possessed participants walked on hot coals and burnt their flesh with fire, and at one point, a person bit the head off a living chicken. A Wikileaks classified email released in 2016 also exposed Hillary Clinton for what she really is  an occultist who bows down to Moloch, the same pagan god they perform human sacrifice rituals for at the annual Bohemian Grove meetings. In a Clinton email from August 29 2008 published by Wikileaks, a senior government staffer writes to Hillary Clinton, With fingers crossed, the old rabbits foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .

Sadly, this is exactly what millions of Americans have been fearing. The Republicans are carrying out a major attack against poor people and senior citizens, all so they can give a few more tax cuts to their rich friends.

As Gray TV reported recently, “President Donald Trump proposed cutting the multi-billion-dollar program as part of his budget plan. Government estimates suggest six million people rely on it to heat, cool, or weatherize their homes.”

This is just the latest example of the Trump administration’s utter disregard for everyday people in our country. Time and time again, Trump has taken every opportunity he has to make life harder for the people in the bottom 50 percent of America.

The Republicans have spent years trying to destroy everything that makes America great. Now that they have control of the House, the Senate, and the presidency, they are ramping up their ruthless campaign to full speed.

It’s time for Americans to wake up and stand up to the stupid Republican politicians in Washington D.C. – enough is enough!"

“I just want what’s best for our country,” Bullock said during a press conference for her new film, Our Brand Is Crisis, in Los Angeles on Friday.

Bullock, who plays Jane “Calamity” Bodine, a political strategist, in the upcoming movie, says her own views are colored by her son Louis.

“I would like my rights represented and those of my son – very selfish views and I think everyone else has them,” she says. “When this film came along, it came along at a time that I was having that internal discussion with myself about who in our country would step out of their comfort zone to help others for the greater good.”

Bullock, who says she’d “do anything” for her son, said this “internal discussion” hinged largely on who else, on a larger scale, would work to represent Louis’ best interests.

The Oscar-winner says that her mother “did things that were definitely ahead of her time, as a woman.”

“I never realized that there were limitations where I was looked at as less than until I was actually pretty deep in this business and I had a pretty unsettling moment, and I went ‘Oh my god, I’m being treated this way because I’m female,’ ” she said.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/05/new-century-times/white-house-staffers-removed-job-subject-false/,"President Donald Trump has only been in office for a short time and hes already caused so much anxiety to the country, including the intelligence community. Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Heres what WJ just reported: The staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the Questionnaire for National Security Positions. The 127-page document includes questions on the applicants credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects. The six staffers included the daughter of President Trumps Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles: Wiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico. The form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions. Its striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldnt be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration: Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be their most sacred obligation. Schiff added, referring to Trump: Im sure there are people in the community who feel they dont know where hes coming from on Russia.' Just as was the case with Michael Flynn who just recently resigned over his shady ties to Russia, you can bet that this administration is being closely watched.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/08/american-today/no-proof-queen-elizabeth-removed-obamas-prince-har/,"Queen Elizabeth has personally removed Michelle and Barack Obama from the guest list for Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle, according to British reports.

Invitations to Royal weddings in England have traditionally been extended to the sitting President of the United States and the current First Lady, so when Queen Elizabeth saw what Michelle Obama was up to – trying to sneak a spot at the wedding at the expense of the real POTUS and FLOTUS – she delivered Michelle a well-deserved and humiliating beatdown.

While Barack Obama has been traveling around the world, operating as some kind of shadow president and attempting to undermine the real POTUS, Michelle has been trying to push her way into every major social event where she doesn’t belong and is apparently not invited.

When Michelle Obama heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl, she assumed it was her rightful place to be on that guest list. Michelle made a desperate move to sneak a spot on the guest list, but unfortunately for the former First Lady, the guest list has to be approved by the Queen of England herself.
Timeline of Queen Elizabeth’s brutal Obama smackdown

As soon as Buckingham Palace announced the news that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were officially engaged, the opportunistic Obamas saw their chance to edge their way into the elites, like a couple of desperate kids trying to hang with the popular crowd at school. Barack immediately got on social media to beat President Trump to the congratulatory punch. Barack has a lot more time on his hands than the current POTUS who is cleaning up the mess he left behind.

Barack, who had been practically stalking Prince Harry on Twitter in recent weeks, made a post within seconds of the news coming out, which served the purpose of letting the Royals know that he and Michelle were angling for an invitation to the wedding of the year.

The Obamas are experts at playing the crowd for fools, and Barack’s sycophantic post got a whopping one million likes. The Obamas were likely over the moon about this return on their cynical investment, because it meant Prince Harry and the Royal Family were likely to see it and a seat at the high table was surely theirs for the taking.

The exposure of Barack’s post sparked rumors that the Obamas would likely be added to the guest list at the expense of the current president and first lady, London’s Independent reported. But while Barack was busy sending desperate tweets and DMs to secretly get on the coveted guest list, Michelle was doing something worse to shove the Trumps aside and ensure her spot, even though the honor is traditionally reserved for the current president and first lady.

Michelle has been doing the rounds on the speaking tour lately, trying to rack in hundreds of thousands of dollars and trash Trump at the same time. Her recent trip to Canada was no exception. She combined her usual trash talk with the hidden goal of getting to the historic royal wedding.

Addressing the “Economic Club of Toronto,” Michelle deviated from her usual Trump bashing shtick and went into overdrive, kissing up to the Queen of England at every opportunity, and criticizing POTUS Trump whenever possible. Michelle really wanted that wedding invite.

According to Page Six, Michelle took the opportunity to make fun of President Trump then immediately gushed over the queen. Both conversation deviations had no place in an event like this, but for calculated Michelle, it has a passive-aggressive purpose of saying that Trump wasn’t fit for her guest list, but since she loves the Queen so much, she should get a spot.

“After being introduced by Canada’s first lady, Sophie Trudeau, Obama told the crowd that it is ‘never a good idea’ to put your first thought in the morning on social media, and never a good idea to ‘tweet from bed,’ which appears to be one of the president’s favorite pastimes, presuming that he is actually in bed when he tweets at 3 a.m,” Page Six reported.

“Going on about effective communication, and the importance of doing drafts, Obama went on, ‘Then you need to edit and spell-check it.’ The 45-minute conversation, hosted by the Economic Club of Toronto, flowed into a bunch of amusing side stories, including her memories of being awestruck when meeting Queen Elizabeth of England.”
“’What do you do with the Queen? I touched her. She touched me first,’ she said, adding that her dream dinner guest would be Jesus, whom she’d serve pizza.”

It’s well known that the respect, proper etiquette, and holding a high-level of decorum is important to the Royal Family and by painting a picture that Trump is an impetuous buffoon who can’t control himself, Michelle thought she was making him look like a bad person to have at the wedding.

However, the bigger motive in her comments was to cover up her actual faux-pas with the Queen when, not surprisingly, brash Michelle showed a complete lack of respect and protocol when she got a little too touchy.

The moment she bullied her way into a hug and pushed the Queen toward a chair was the moment Queen Elizabeth decided there was to be no place for Michelle or Barack Obama at the wedding, The Guardian previously reported.
The Queen felt so grossly disrespected by Michelle that she royally snubbed the former first lady after the touchy-feely offense.

When she flew into London with her mother and daughters in tow, expecting an audience with Queen Elizabeth, she received a big slap-in-the-face instead, the Globe reported. Instead of spending the day with Michelle and her family who flew in to meet with her, the Queen ditched her and went off the horse races instead.

Michelle may think she’s royalty and even try to act like it, but she’s got nothing on the actual Queen of England who is the real deal and put her in her place. The Queen does what she wants and by kicking desperate Michelle Obama off the guest list, and extending an invitation to the real POTUS and FLOTUS instead, she showed she is no-one’s fool."
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/08/someonesbones/fake-news-military-raided-obamas-compound-thailand/,"Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand [Note: Please view our newest article on Trumps attack against Deep State assets: FBI RAIDS HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON COLLABORATOR During the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin. A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, and held position while Trump cleared the incursion with his Thai counterparts. According to our source, the Trump administration learned that Obama, by proxy, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket, approximately 500 km from Bangkok. On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year. In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money. Our Secret Service source supports that contention. Obama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases. He doesnt keep them in his name, as that would be too conspicuous. The administration has learned about many of them and has been working with foreign governments to seize Obamas illicitly gained assets. Many of these nations are not exactly friendly to the United States; we dont know what Trump offered in exchange for rights to seize assets in non-extradition countries or put special operations boots on the ground on foreign soil. Im sure the price way high. Clandestine missions are occurring right now. The Solyndra mansion was just one of many, our source explained. At 3:00 am (local time), a pair of helicopters, including decoy craft, airlifted Delta to its destination. They found the mansion deserted; however, according to our source, the dwelling had been recently occupied. The unit commander discovered freshly chopped vegetables and lukewarm coffee in the kitchen; outside fresh tire impressions lead away from the compound. Someone, our source said, must have tipped off the occupants shortly before Delta arrived on scene. Still, Delta did not leave the location empty-handed. They seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Moreover, and perhaps most disturbing, a maze of underground tunnels, ostensibly used for human trafficking, ran for miles in every direction beneath the surface. Having gathered all available evidence, they requested exfiltration and handed-off control to Thai law enforcement. Under power granted by the ASEAN Declaration to Joint Action on Counter Terrorism, Thai officials confiscated the estate and all remaining possessions contained therein.

This rumor began circulating as soon as Trump was elected President of the United States, but these idiots continue to push the matter. Our message to them, DO IT. We don’t need jerks like you in Hollywood anyway. The fact that people like Rosie O’Donnell think that the movie and television industry wouldn’t survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are.

Mike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike, warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry. He mentioned the lower paid support staff who do all of the behind the scenes work.

“The people who do all the real work in Hollywood are the people who build the sets, who make the costumes, who create the props, and in some cases, do the stunts and the special effects,”Mike explained. “And they’re not getting the bazillion dollar deals.”

It’s about time that these jerkoffs realize that they aren’t the only people in this world. The fact remains that Donald Trump is our President, whether they like it or not, and that isn’t about to change.

Let’s hope that for the sake of everyone else in Hollywood these ignorant celebrities suck it up and deal with the fact that their candidate didn’t win. Maybe if they took their heads out of their asses long enough to even listen to Trump’s goals for his time in office they would feel different

Watch one news network’s story on the matter:"
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/16/americannewscom/oprahs-comments-about-race-2013-bbc-interview-dist/,"Oprah Winfrey made some shocking comments in a recent interview with BBC, when she alluded that the only reason someone wouldn’t like President Barack Obama is if they were a racist.

When the interviewer asked Oprah if she thought people were against Obama because he was black, she responded, “There’s no question.”

She went on to say that she thinks “there’s a level of disrespect for the office that occurs. And that occurs in some cases because he’s African American. There’s no question about that. And it’s the kind of thing no one ever says, buy everybody is thinking.”

Apparently Oprah isn’t aware that her comments don’t set her apart. Instead, they group her with a slew of Obama supporters that claim that disapproval of the president stems from either religious or racial discrimination. And she clearly hasn’t paid attention to stations like MSNBC or “celebrities” like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.

She certainly isn’t alone in her accusations, but continued on to make a statement about racisms in general, stating that “As long as people can be judged by the color of their skin, problem’s not solved.”

So when does Oprah see racism coming to an end?

“There are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in it, in that prejudice and racism,” Oprah said, “and they just have to die.”

That’s right, according to Oprah, when everyone who ever had a racist ancestor dies, America will be set free from all of its problems.

What do you think of Oprah’s shocking comments?"
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/17/republican-news/no-uranium-one-investigation-has-not-led-indictmen/,"While we were busy chasing the “S***hole” not-so-shiny object the press laid out for us on Friday, it is now discovered what the media was trying to distract us from! And it is HUGE!

The DOJ handed down an indictment in the Uranium One Deal released on Friday. THIS is what the media was trying so hard to cover-up. Unlike the leak with Manafort and his indictment (which had nothing to do with Russian collusion in the Trump campaign), America woke up to non-stop news about Manafort turning himself in. Click HERE to read more about that. Manafort has since sued Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Fast forward to today. Uranium One Deal has its FIRST INDICTMENT against Mark Lambert.
Mark Lambert of Maryland has been indicted for “allegedly paid bribes to a Russian Official so his Company could win highly sensitive nuclear fuel transportation contracts.”

The “11-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.” This is serious. And it stems from Russian collusion in the Obama-era.

“The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.”

KUDOS to the Trump-era DOJ American’s can trust.
The hard working and honest DOJ team, under Jeff Sessions, made the announcement yesterday.

The team members are: Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen M. Schenning of the District of Maryland, Principal Deputy Inspector General April G. Stephenson of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) and Assistant Director in Charge Andew W. Vale of the FBI’s Washington, D.C. Field Office, as mentioned in the DOJ statement.

Here is the Statement Below:

An indictment against a former co-president of a Maryland-based transportation company that provides services for the transportation of nuclear materials to customers in the United States and abroad, was unsealed today for his alleged role in a scheme that involved the bribery of an official at a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen M. Schenning of the District of Maryland, Principal Deputy Inspector General April G. Stephenson of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) and Assistant Director in Charge Andew W. Vale of the FBI’s Washington, D.C. Field Office made the announcement.

Mark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was charged in an 11-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering. The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.

The case against Lambert is assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland.

According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at “Transportation Corporation A” to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.

In order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments, Lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to Transportation Corporation A, that described services that were never provided, and then Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia, Cyprus and Switzerland. Lambert and others also allegedly used code words like “lucky figures,” “LF,” “lucky numbers,” and “cake” to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account.T

he indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A’s services.

In June 2015, Lambert’s former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA. Mikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing. The indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The case is being investigated by DOE-OIG and the FBI. Assistant Chiefs Ephraim Wernick and Christopher J. Cestaro and Trial Attorney Derek J. Ettinger of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, as well as Assistant U.S. Attorneys David I. Salem and Michael T. Packard of the District of Maryland, are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs has provided significant assistance in this matter. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Switzerland, Latvia and Cyprus for providing valuable assistance with the investigation and prosecution of the case.

The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Department’s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa."
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/24/patriot-report/fake-story-says-elderly-man-shot-muslims-self-defe/,"82-year-old William DeLisle of Marina Del Ray, California, has been sentenced to death for defending himself against a life-threatening situation. In October of 2015, DeLisle was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims.

The men, Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu, were already wanted for a crime spree that spanned nearly four years with dozens of victims. They preyed on older Americans, often grabbing them off the street to beat and rob them. Until they met DeLisle.

Now, Hallalla is in a wheelchair breathing through a tube and Salabu is dead. DeLisle, who stormed the beach at Normandy as a young man, responded to the young men like any good Marine would. He pulled a .22 from his ankle holster — which is “illegal” in California — and put both men down in seconds.

Prosecutors said that because the two men were unarmed and using threats instead of actually hurting DeLisle meant that there was no imminent danger and that the use of deadly force was “extreme and unnecessary.” The Dewey County Prosecutor explained in a press release:

“Mr. DeLisle could have handed over his wallet without incident. Instead, he chose to pull an illegally carried firearm from a concealed location and shot the two men. Had he stopped there it may not have been such a major incident, as both men’s initial wounds were superficial.

While they were on the ground, DeLisle told Salabu that if he didn’t ‘denounce his pagan moon god, Allah, that he would be meeting him. Salabu closed his eyes to pray and DeLisle put two bullets in his skull.

Hallalla, after seeing his friend murdered, tried to flee and was shot in the spine, paralizing him for life. This wasn’t self-defense. It was murder and religious persecution.”

Religious persecution? How much you want to bet if the tables were turned and an elderly Muslim killed two Christian men trying to mug him he’d get a medal from the Governor of California?

DeLisle has nothing to be concerned with, since the pansies in California don’t actually execute prisoners. They have a moratorium on their useless death penalty and have for decades. He will, however, die in prison. His lawyer said DeLisle expressed that it was a “small price to pay if he saved others from these two monsters.”

DeLisle hasn’t asked for an appeal.

Mueller will also be forced to resign from his position as Special Prosecutor for the FBI, nullifying everything that investigator has uncovered as fruit of the poisonous tree.

Pelosi, who says her husband was well-aware of the affair, swears that Mueller was just a friend whose company she enjoyed on long, lonely working nights and weekends in Washington. The California “progressive” says her husband was afforded the same freedom to explore “pleasures of the flesh.” :

“We’re not interested in defending our actions or our values as human beings. I’m a public servant who will continue to serve until my health or my constituents say otherwise.”

Regardless of how much we hate Nacy Pelosi, she represents a Congressional District that saw a million fraudulent votes from illegal immigrants. She’ll hold that seat until she dies.

Mueller, on the other hand, is looking at a messy divorce, a public humiliation and the loss of his job. He’ll also go down in history as the man who had solid evidence against several Trump surrogates and allowed their cases to all be dismissed on a technicality. None of it would have led to Trump, but it still lifts a huge weight from his legacy.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/26/heartland-institute/do-work-requirements-lead-self-sufficiency/,"On Jan. 11, the Trump administrations Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a new guidance to state Medicaid directors permitting them to create work/community engagement requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Federal officials have never previously allowed states to enact work requirements for Medicaid, a program intended to act as a health insurance safety net for the neediest Americans. Work requirements are an essential tool all states should utilize. They have been proven to help impoverished families move from dependency to self-sufficiency and guarantee Medicaid programs have enough money to cover the costs of those children, disabled, and sick Americans who desperately need access to health insurance but dont have the ability to pay for it themselves. ADVERTISEMENT Myth one: Work requirements are unfair because some people cant find jobs. The term work requirements is a bit misleading. Generally, safety-net work requirements allow recipients to participate in community engagement activities instead of obtaining a traditional job. These activities include volunteering, joining a job-training program, and enrolling in college or another qualifying education program. Myth two: Work requirements hurt the poor. On Jan. 12, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote that the reason reformers want to change welfare programs such as Medicaid is because they want to cause pain. Over the past few years it has become increasingly clear that the suffering imposed by Republican opposition to safety-net programs isnt a bug, its a feature. Inflicting pain is the point, Krugman wrote. This is completely untrue. The Trump administration and states desiring to pass Medicaid reform know that without work requirements and other reforms that incentivize people who can work to pursue self-sufficiency, many people who dont have job skills end up trapped in a cycle of poverty and others abuse the system, consuming resources meant only for the neediest Americans. Although Medicaid work requirements have never been allowed until now, work requirements in other safety-net programs have helped millions of people become less dependent on the government. Prior to welfare reform being implemented in 1996 by a Republican-led Congress and President Clinton, there were 13.4 million (1995 figure) Americans enrolled in the nations Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Since then, rolls in that program  now called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program  have declined by 73 percent, down to about 3.7 million people. Similarly, welfare reforms passed in Kansas improved families financial well-being to an astounding degree. Nic Horton and Jonathan Ingram at the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) found those who left TANF in Kansas experienced an income increase of 104 percent after just one year off the program and 247 percent after four years. In allowing work requirements for Medicaid, the Trump administration isnt trying to inflict harm, its trying to help able-bodied people on Medicaid experience the same kind of positive results many people once dependent on TANF now enjoy. Myth three: Work requirements are cruel and target the disabled and stay-at-home parents. Perhaps one of the most widespread myths circulating about work requirements is that they somehow force extremely sick and disabled people to work. Its strange that this myth has garnered so much attention since the CMS guidance specifically states the work requirements may only apply to non-elderly, non-pregnant adult Medicaid beneficiaries who are eligible for Medicaid on a basis other than disability. In other words, states cannot force those who are disabled to work. Some have argued that there are many people who depend on Medicaid with serious illnesses that dont qualify as disabilities. Im not sure how many of these individuals exist, but nothing is forcing states to make these people work, and CMS has the power to reject any proposed Medicaid waiver that cruelly targets any group of Americans. Others have claimed work requirements hurt families because they force adults caring for loved ones full-time to spend too much time away from home. However, the CMS guidance lists caregiving as one of the activities that can satisfy a states work or community engagement requirements, so theres no reason to think millions of kids in Medicaid households will suddenly be abandoned by mom or dad when a state passes Medicaid work requirement legislation. Myth four: Work requirements make people ""jump through hoops to prove their neediness."" In Krugmans article for the Times, he argued Medicaid work requirements arent about saving money, but rather stigmatizing those who receive government aid, forcing them to jump through hoops to prove their neediness. This, too, is all wrong. Work requirements dont have anything to do with making people prove their neediness, although recipients are, of course, required under various other provisions to prove they are qualified before they receive Medicaid. Work requirements simply ask those who receive taxpayer-funded Medicaid insurance to do their fair share, by working, volunteering, or educating themselves so that they can eventually afford to pay for their own private health insurance. There are other Medicaid reforms states have (and should) pass that deal with asset testing and other methods for ensuring those who enroll in Medicaid really need it, but work requirements are totally separate. Myth five: Work requirements wont save any money and are unpopular. The Foundation for Government Accountability projects nationwide Medicaid work requirements would lower enrollment by 13.6 million by 2027 and save $1 trillion over ten years. Even if FGA is way off, work requirements are still likely to save hundreds of billions of dollars and help millions of people become less dependent on government. Further, despite all the negative press they have received, polling shows Medicaid work requirements are popular. According to Rasmussen Reports, which conducted a national telephone and online survey of 1,000 Americans on Jan. 1415, 64 percent of American Adults think that childless, able-bodied adults in their state should be required to work as a condition for receiving Medicaid.

For years the Haitians have been struggling and protesting outside the Clinton Foundation offices over the robbery.

The money taken was donated by the individuals and business directly to the Clinton Foundation, thinking they were going to receive aid. However, the opposite it true. The money never even made it to the poorest of the poor. Now we have one man ready to testify against the corrupt Clinton Foundation in the upcoming week. However, the 50 year old man, a former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein, was found dead in his Miami home with a “gunshot to the head” that’s been ruled a “suicide” by the Miami-Dade’s medical examiner records supervisor.

Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.

Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.

Eberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundation’s activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government’s economic development agency, Fonds d’assistance économique et social, for three years.

According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% – or $5.4 billion – was funneled to non-Haitian organizations.

“The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,” Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year.

The former director general of Haiti, who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and even has a pizza — the Klaus Special — named after him.

According to the Haiti Libre newspaper, Eberwein was said to be in “good spirits“, with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide.

“It’s really shocking,” said Muncheez’s owner Gilbert Bailly. “We grew up together; he was like family.” –Your News Wire

Americans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016, former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clinton’s dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office.

To his credit, candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the Clinton’s, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.

Sansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to “side” with the Clinton Administration and he would “be the richest man in Haiti.”

He also demanded that Hillary Clinton “disclose the audit of all money” related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation.

“Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you. Ask Hillary Clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti.”

Just hours after ABC canceled its hit sitcom “Roseanne” due to an ugly racist tweet by its controversial star, Roseanne Barr, the Fox Network said it would be picking up the show.

“We’re excited to announce that ‘Roseanne’ will be coming to Fox this fall,” said Brian Sullivan, Fox Networks Group president and COO. “The controversy regarding Ms. Barr’s racially charged Twitter message, as well as her bigoted attitudes, are just some of the reasons we’re happy to welcome her to the Fox family. And we know our audience of narrow-minded, unsophisticated bumpkins will welcome her just as enthusiastically.”

In her vulgar post, Ms. Barr wrote that Valerie Jarrett, an African-American adviser to President Barack Obama, was the offspring of the “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.” The abhorrent tweet met with immediate condemnation on social media from all moderate voices, but cheers among Fox’s white supremacist fans.

President Donald Trump, who had called Ms. Barr earlier in the year to congratulate her on the success of her show, and who uses Fox programming to promote his administration’s policies, was thrilled to hear that “Roseanne” would be coming to his favorite network.

“Big news for ‘Roseanne’ fans and everyone who enjoys ‘black’ humor,” tweeted the president on Tuesday night. “I know that all Ms. Barr wants to do is make America great again and kudos to Fox for keeping that hope alive.”

“Roseanne” will air on Monday nights at 8:00pm on the Fox Network starting in September.

It’s one thing to stick to one’s beliefs, but it’s another thing to allow those beliefs to cross the line and become zealotry. It appears Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz crossed that line during the meeting, mixing his belief system with business.

Schultz went on to claim that Starbucks strives to “embrace diversity of all kinds.” He went on to tell a shareholder who stands behind tradition marriage to sell his shares and invest elsewhere.

Forbes reported that Schultz seemed hostile and intolerant of any shareholders who objected to gay marriage for moral or religious reasons.

During the meeting, shareholder Tom Strobhar (who founded the Corporate Morality Action Center) pointed out that after the company voiced its support for a referendum backing gay marriage in Washington state, a boycott by traditional marriage supporters caused a drop in sales revenue.

What do you think? Is this a bad move on Starbucks’ part?

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/07/blog-posting/it-illegal-shower-and-do-laundry-same-day-californ/,"California Governor Jerry Brown just signed a draconian new law that makes it illegal to take a shower, and do laundry on the same day:

Assembly Bill 1668 establishes a limit of 55 gallons per person daily as the standard for indoor residential water use, starting in the year 2022. Violators will have to pay a fine of $1,000 per day during normal seasons and $10,000 per day if “the violation occurs in a critically dry year immediately preceded by two or more consecutive below normal, dry, or critically dry years,” the law states.

According to the attentive folks at The Organic Prepper, this allotted water ration exceeds the amount required for taking a shower and doing a single load of laundry and excludes taking baths altogether.

Writer Daisy Luther notes that an ordinary load of laundry uses about 40 gallons of water, while an eight-minute shower uses some 17 gallons of water. A bathtub holds 80 to 100 gallons of water. This means combining a shower and laundry on the same day would use 57 gallons of water, two gallons above the limit.

According to the new law, the 55-gallon per person limit will be reduced even further in future years, dropping to 52.5 gallons per capita in 2025 and just 50 gallons per person in 2030.

To ensure compliance, the government of California urges the use of creative surveillance systems to spy on all residents. Utility providers will be obligated to report on violators, and urban retail water suppliers “shall use satellite imagery, site visits, or other best available technology to develop an accurate estimate of landscaped areas.”

So as not to overburden the wealthy, there will be “provisions for swimming pools, spas, and other water features,” the law states. …

The new, more aggressive mandatory water use levels set by the State Water Resources Control Board in coordination with the Department of Water Resources establish the initial indoor water allowance of 55 gallons per person per day and will also set an outdoor residential amount as well as a standard for system wide pipe leak losses.

This new law is ridiculous and will turn most honest, law abiding residents of California into lawbreakers.

Even worse, the drought has technically ended in California, so these restrictions make no sense based on current conditions.

If the politicians who run the state really wanted to solve the problem they would have limited the amount of grass homeowners can plant, and ban swimming pools.

Instead they come up with stupid rules, designed to harm those who can least afford it.

“I think you’ve got a president who has some very serious emotional problems.”

“I’m especially concerned about his constant tweets about North Korea. It’s already bad and he is adding fuel to the fire.”

Romney added, “You’ve got a president who has been accused, by many, many women of harassment, to say the least. This is a guy who was on a tape seen by everybody in America essentially bragging about his sexual assault of women.”

“Do I think under those considerations of Al Franken resigned, do I think the president should resign? I do. Do I think he will? I don’t. But, yes, I do think he should resign.”

Romney continued, “Let me take it a little step further. We have a president of the United States who acknowledged on a tape widely seen all over the country that he’s assaulted women, so I would hope maybe the president of the United States might pay attention of what’s going on and also think about resigning.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/13/newsflash/hoax-continues-circulate-foxs-shepard-smith-fired/,"A dispute in Angela Merkels coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship. The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leaders own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellors fate, possibly as soon as Monday. Horst Seehofer, Merkels interior minister and the leader of Bavarias Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continents struggle with migration. Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios: Compromise The two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers. Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader. No Compromise In the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. Thats when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkels rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, its hard to see how the coalition continues. Even if it doesnt come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious. Confidence vote For a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own partys votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats. Germanys Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. Its a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections. Merkel resigns Should the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germanys ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election. Split on the right The CDU and the CSU are sister parties, with a joint parliamentary caucus and electoral program. Think of the CSU as the center-rights Bavarian chapter  the CDU operates in all of Germanys 16 states except Bavaria. So a breach would be drastic, but not unprecedented. In 1976, CSU chairman Franz-Josef Strauss called off the joint caucus, but the split was short-lived. For the Bavarians, going it alone would theoretically open a path for the CDU to campaign in Bavaria, weakening the CSUs position. A hoax tweet that rattled markets on Friday raised exactly that possibility. It presented a fake quote from the CDU state premier of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, as saying his party should prepare to set up a Bavarian chapter for the next national election. Merkels chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, quickly stepped in to say the report was invented. We should all remain calm, he said."

Sources explained to the publication that a memo was released last week to Kushner and other White House aides informing them that their security clearances would be downgraded from the Top Secret/SCI level to the Secret level.

Biden hosted a meeting with several top aides at his office near Capitol Hill to work on his new diplomacy center. During the meeting, he explained to those in attendance  including his former chief of staff, his former national security adviser and a former State Department official that he had not yet decided about 2020. He relied to his longtime aides that he would be interested in them joining his campaign if he did decide to make a run for the White House, The Associated Press reported. A spokesperson for Biden refused to offer a comment to any media outlets. Biden, 75, is currently considered a strong Democratic presidential nominee if he runs. He has already suggested in public several time that he is considering a campaign, but has not made a final decision. He mulled over a presidential campaign back in 2016, but decided against it following his sons death. Recent polling shows Biden leading over President Trump in a hypothetical 2020 match-up.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/07/ny-fox-news-ny-fox-news/fake-news-claims-michelle-obama-has-made-hateful-c/,"Michelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.

Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.

Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.

Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:

Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?

Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”

Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.

“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”

As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.

“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.

Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.

The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.

Dean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she’s more than profited off of:

So, Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim, racist pathetic husband was elected.

Hey lady, I hate to break it to you but your ‘husband’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos. The only reason he was elected is because he is black.

The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was."
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/09/meddaily/no-flu-shot-was-not-designed-spread-cancer/,"Dr. John Bergman issues warning to the public of ‘flu panic’. Dr. John Bergman says the flu vaccine is laced with cancer-causing ingredients. A top doctor has gone on the record to blow the whistle in a video statement and reveal that flu vaccines have been laced with “cancer-causing ingredients.”

Dr. John Bergman has revealed the influenza vaccinations being used to combat the latest H3N2 strain, are virtually ineffective and being forced onto the public through fear tactics to spread cancer.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the current flu strain is the most severe to date, and leads to more extreme, and often fatal, symptoms.

Tens of thousands of people have died so far during this flu season, and as the mortality rate rises, so does the fear, and citizens are queuing up for flu shots, all while Big Pharma is cashing in.

Now, according to Dr. Bergman, evidence has emerged that the vaccinations may be causing far more damage to people’s health than anyone could have previously anticipated. tens of thousands are dying from the flu this season.

According to Anna Treague, a health official for Public Health, the severity of H3N2 has been caused by mutations in the virus that triggered by influenza vaccinations. In a statement to ABC news,

Treague confirmed that this year’s flu strain, that has left thousands of citizens dead, was caused by the vaccines itself, saying: “I believe that the low effective rate of the vaccine this year is due to the mutations that the virus made in the processing of the vaccine itself.

“That is at LEAST part of the reason that influenza cases are so widespread this year.” Treague clearly states that the vaccination is at “LEAST” part of the problem, if not the WHOLE problem. anna treague says the virus has been mutated by flu vaccines.

Anna Treague says the virus has been mutated by flu vaccines Other health experts agree with Teague statement, including Dr. Mercola, who is one of the world’s leading authorities on the dangers of vaccines. Speaking about the mutations caused by the vaccines, Mercola says, “It’s no surprise at all.”

Dr. Mercola isn’t alone with his prognosis, as countless other medical professionals, MDs, and PhDs all agree. Demand for Vaccines is Increasing The problem is though, as more people get sick, more people are queuing up to get their flu shots, and the situation is snowballing from bad to worse.

According to Treague, the immune system is weaker at the beginning and at the end of a person’s life. This causes the body of a child or elderly to have to fight much harder to fend off viruses than a person in their 20s or 30s.

Even though the flu shot has only be found to be 10% effective against this year’s strain, the government still insists that it’s imperative that every citizen is vaccinated, despite the clear dangers.

How would the families of those already killed after receiving the shot respond to that news?

According to allopathic medicine, we should rush to see our doctor as soon as we experience so they can treat us with antiviral medication. The dangers of Tamiflu are no secret though and it can only shorten the duration by 12 hours. The recommended course of action is to stay home and not spread the virus.

Symptoms usually appear after 1-3 days of being infected and most people usually recover in under a week. Just don’t ignore your symptoms though, which include chills, fever, headache, dry cough and aching of joints and muscles."

Do You Support Her?

For the show’s cold open, Alec Baldwin entered the fray with his latest Donald Trump skit, poking fun at the President-elect over his retweet of a 16-year-old boy’s support. During a “security briefing,” Baldwin’s character interrupted the session with “important” news.
“Kellyanne,” Baldwin rasped, “I just retweeted the the best tweet. I mean, wow,” he gushed.
“What a great, smart tweet. This could not wait. It was from a young man named Seth, He’s 16, he’s in high school, and I really did retweet him,” he insisted. “Seriously. This is real.” Kate McKinnon, playing Conaway, stared vacantly into the camera and said, “He really did do this.”
The real Donald Trump didn’t waste any time tweeting about the sketch, sharing his displeasure on, where else, Twitter.
Is Jennifer Aniston launching a clothing collection with HSN? A new report claims she’s teaming up with Sheryl Crow, who already has a line with the Home Shopping Network. But Gossip Cop has exclusively learned Aniston isn’t involved in any partnership.

The new issue of OK! is announcing, “Sheryl & Jen’s Home Shopping Hookup.” In the article, the tabloid claims the singer is “steering her pal toward the Home Shopping Network.” A so-called “insider” is quoted as saying of Crow, “She’s shocked at how much fun it is and how much money she is making relative to the time and effort she put into her last album. Now she wants Jen to team up with her on a collection they’ll design and sell together!”
According to the gossip magazine’s supposed source, Aniston is on board with the idea because she’s been “looking for more opportunities outside of acting.” Cautions the snitch, “The big leap would be hawking the collection on-air, but Sheryl makes that look easy, and Jen would essentially be a guest star.” The alleged tipster further contends to the outlet, “Jen is thrilled that Sheryl suggested it. She can dip her toe into a lifestyle brand and see if that’s something she wants to pursue. It’s kind of a no-brainer for her. She has a built-in fan base that’ll love her stuff.”
The publication notes this purported project is still in the “planning stages,” which could be why there are no specifics given about what type of apparel Aniston and Crow would design or when the clothing might debut. More likely, though, the real reason this article is so general and vague is because there’s no such collection in the works.

No one with whom Gossip Cop spoke, including Aniston’s rep, could confirm any plans to do a line for HSN. In fact, we’re told that the star’s agents and manager have not had any discussions about this alleged career move.
And there’s further reason to doubt the legitimacy of this supposed scoop: OK! has a beyond horrible track record when it comes to reporting on Aniston. The tabloid has spent years publishing untrue pregnancy reports about the actress, including a cover story two months ago that falsely claimed Aniston was expecting a “miracle baby at 48.”

“I went truly tough amid the race,” the “We Can’t Stop” singer says in a meeting for Billboard, referencing Clinton’s triumph in the popular vote.

“Be that as it may, toward the day’s end, we lost. We won, but since the system is f***ed up, we lost. I thought, ‘alright. I took in my lesson on this one.” Cyrus stated.

She had this to say about Trump fans: “Be that as it may, don’t Trump supporters like the way they think? So I’ve additionally got the chance to open up to the way I approach individuals with my conclusions. That is the best way to roll out genuine improvement.”

Last March, Cyrus, promised to leave the United States if Donald Trump won the election. “Truly f*** this crap I am moving if this is my leader!” Cyrus posted on Instagram. Months after the fact, she called Sanders fans who declined to vote in favor of Clinton “f***ing insane.”

However then she changed her mind and stayed. In the meeting with Billboard, Cyrus reacted to critics who asked her why she didn’t fulfil her promise to move out of the country: “It’s not time for me to leave now, man. I must be here. I must put this place back together, in light of the fact that I’m from Tennessee — that state [went to] Donald Trump.”

“I’m such a visionary, and I know a considerable measure of things that I’ve needed to do individuals said weren’t conceivable,” the LGBT lobbyist stated.

The worldwide pop symbol intends to get “very political” with her new music album, “Younger Now,” which includes a song called “Inspired” which she devoted to Hillary Clinton, her political idol. Miley stated that she’s battling for “equality” and “justice” not “hate” and “walls.”

However she is not satisfied about her current career status and she is blaming Trump supporters for that. She is not one of the top-selling artists anymore and she is convinced that Trump fans have something to do with that.

She stated: “I’m sure that they have something to do with this. The amount of hate that I receive is unbelievable. If this continues I’m gonna leave the US and go to Australia or wherever. I swear. At least while Trump is here. He’s not my President.”

The police took his gun without a warrant and without pressing any charges. Tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil. This sets a precedent that government can now forcefully take guns away from an individual without a crime being committed or an arrest being made and without a warrant. In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric, a citizens Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government. The new red flag law, which has taken hold in other states already, allows the courts and law enforcement to take away guns from individuals they deem are dangerous and theyve just begun the confiscation. A man living in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington became the first individual in the state to have his firearm confiscated without any formal arrest or charges. The man was not identified by authorities. Neighbors complained that the man had been staring at people through storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm. He was not brandishing his weapon by any account, and open carrying is legal in the area, so he was abiding by the law. Other residents also complained that the mans open carrying made them feel uncomfortable and unsafe. He was roaming the hallways with a .25 caliber automatic, said Tony Montana, a man who lives in the same apartment complex as the gun owner and a person without any reasonable gun knowledge. Handguns are semi-automatic. These lousy complaints from neighbors allowed police to use the newly passed state law to confiscate the mans firearm because the man apparently stared at others. Maybe theres a ban on staring at others in Washington we are unaware of. Under the extreme risk protection orders  also referred to as erpos or red flag laws  police (government officials) are now allowed to violate a persons Second and Fourth Amendment rights (which are basic fundamental human rights) and take their legally acquired personal property if they are tattled on by offended liberals."

This is something that the mainstream media does not wanna show.

This is huge.

On behalf of Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education, President Donald Trump’s legal team has petitioned the court to make America safer, starting from our children first. In a 5-3 decision, that was not a difficult interpretation of the constitution, the high court ruled that public school is the United States will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.

According to our source, USA Politics Today, the students will learn about Islam in history, as they do Christianity and all other religions, only as it pertains to the time period they are studying.

Judge Neil Gorsuch wrote, “The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn’t a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.

We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.”

Gorsuch continued, “It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.”

The Obama Administration forced the children to learn about Islam as the “Religion of Peace,” only so that they could be more tolerant of the terrorists. But those days are over now. Our country and Christianity made a huge victory.

Thanks to our President Donald Trump, we can go back to respecting our true values and the worshiping of the one and only true God.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/22/universal-news-portal/hoax-claims-barack-obama-broke-law-reclaim-preside/,"In all history of governance, there has been an unspoken pact between the former and current presidents of the United States in which both Presidents, collaborate and work together for the betterment of the whole country. Putting aside small disagreements and petty grievances in order to focus on current problems that face their countrymen. 

Apparently, Barack Obama didn’t get quite acquainted with the title of former President. His lack of respect and complete resentment towards President Trump has pushed him to his very limits this time. He has been completely obsessed and determined to take Trump down, and even going so far as establishing a shadow government outside the White House that recruits active members to protest his every move. But now, he devised a plan to get back in Office that will really chill your bones.

In the past, his petty resentment drove him to extreme heights. He urged members of the Senate not to repeal Obamacare behind trump's back, he followed Trump on his first overseas trip as President and even on the G20 Summit meeting in Germany. Now he seems to be holding “secret meetings” with world leaders. THAT IS A FEDERAL CRIME!

Here is more U Conservative:

During one of his speeches, Obama tried to convince those present that President Trump doesn’t have America’s best interest at heart, adding that world leaders to support him until he could bring Democrats back in place.

Holding such secret meeting means the Obama is guilty of Federal Crimes. First, he is effectively asking World Leaders to represent the “American Agenda”. Then, he is asking these countries to “pressure” the American Government. He is putting himself in an impossible position.

Obama seems to think he can break the law without repercussions because of the influence he holds within the Justice Department. During his visit to South Korea, Obama made a public statement and called United States Presidency and Agenda “temporary”. For someone who studied constitutional law, he sure doesn’t know his laws.

The “anti-Trump” agenda Obama is pushing backfired on him and played perfectly into Trump’s hands and put him in a strong position to push his “American First” policy. Trump has been holding back on investigating Obama for the sake and honor of the American office and what it holds.

Here is more on the meeting in South Korea from The Daily Caller.

Former President Barack Obama seems to be feeling nostalgic for his old job, meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in Monday for 40 minutes.
The Korea Herald reported that Moon spoke about his recent meetings with President Trump in Washington and asked Obama for his advice on how to improve that relationship.


The meeting came after Obama spoke at the Asian Leadership Conference and the Fourth Congress of Indonesian Diaspora in Jakarta. There he attacked Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change accord.
“In Paris, we came together around the most ambitious agreement in history about climate change, an agreement that even with the temporary absence of American leadership can still give our children a fighting chance,” Obama said in Indonesia.

The former president had said before leaving office that he appreciated his predecessor George W. Bush’s silence during his tenure, but also contended that he’s “still a citizen and that carries with it duties and obligations.”

This Man needs to be investigated NOW! He has committed crimes against America in the past and he is doing it now! Obama created division and despair masked behind the liberal mask of “TOLERANCE” and he continues to do so even after he lost connections to the White House.

These are the actions of a determined criminal mastermind that refuses to accept that he LOST! PLEASE SHARE THIS POST, so that others can find out the truth!"
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/29/uncle-sams-misguided-children/misleading-attack-ron-desantis-about-farm-bill-foo/,"In a statewide Florida Republican primary, the issue of illegal immigration is one of the most important concerns for GOP primary voters, running neck and neck with protecting our Second Amendment rights. For conservative Republicans, who dominate the GOP primary, illegal immigration is less about cultural differences and more about plain ole fairness and security. President Trump has made this his signature issue and he is working to seal our borders. According to votes reviewed by the Central Florida Post, Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis could find himself in hot water with the very voters he needs to secure the nomination. In a 2014 vote, House Resolution 2642 to be exact, three-term Congressman Ron DeSantis voted against banning food stamps for illegal immigrants. The resolution would have modified SNAP to prohibit undocumented immigrants, major lottery winners, traditional college students, convicted murderers, and violent sex offenders from receiving government assistance through SNAP benefits. The Washington Examiner reported in 2016 that illegal immigrants collect anywhere from $1.4 to $2.1 billion worth of food stamps and SNAP benefits annually, while American citizens in need are pushed to the back of the line. This looks very much like a billion-a-year problem, and all totally unnecessary, David North of the Center of Immigration Studies wrote in the report titled, An Aid Program that Routinely Discriminates in Favor of Ineligible Aliens. How can Ron DeSantis expect Republican primary voters to take his candidacy seriously when he voted against a resolution on the floors of congress that could have saved us up to $2.1 billion annually? More so, how does he explain his prioritization of illegal immigrants over his fellow American? Nate Madden of the Conservative Review, who reviewed the same report from CIS, described the program that DeSantis supported as clear-cut discrimination against citizens. Look, we do not have a personal bone to pick with Congressman DeSantis, but the proof is in the pudding. He had an opportunity to cut government waste, prioritize citizens over illegals, and reform one of the nations most abused welfare programs yet he did nothing. If he wishes to be taken seriously as a candidate for Governor, he needs to put Americans and Floridians first. Prioritizing the needs of illegal immigrants over our fellow Americans is one surefire way to go from a leading candidate for Governor, to a total zero. Just last week he was exposed by Politico, for moving to a posh luxury beach condo owned by two defense contractors who have showered Rons campaign with $70,000 in cash, while spending $700,000 a year to lobby Ron and his friends in Congress. For a guy who says he wants to drain the swamp, Ron DeSantiss campaign is funded by swamp dwellers. To become Governor, DeSantis must win the GOP primary and these revelations can only hurt him among the Republican faithful he must court.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/30/blog-posting/donald-trump-just-ended-welfare-immigrants-s-false/,"President Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. Thats called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we dont want migrants who cant fend for themselves. Maybe its better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. Its as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. Its like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe whats happening in Germany, with Merkels come on in policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? Theres already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then thats a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy, he stated on his weekly radio address. As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who cant speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers  and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job  but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to journalist Chris Menahan.They said back in July only 55 out of one million migrants had got jobs with any major firms and 50 of those jobs were working at the post office, he reported. Two-thirds or more of these migrants are illiterate in their own languages.They came because Merkel promised them free money if they can just make it into the country.What in tarnation would be a good reason for any country to accept illiterate people who dont work? There is literally no benefit to the host country to admit people like that. I know it sounds mean to say this, but they dont offer anything to the country other than leeching the system of funds and its a complete downgrade to the population. If you let too many low illiterate people into the country, then they have kids who could be illiterate, then over time, it would only decrease the overall intelligence of the country and civilization in America would suffer. We need hard working and intelligent people who bring promise and productivity to further the advancement of Americans and mankind. That sounds like quite a stretch but think of the impact of accepting one million people who mostly cant read or dont work.Now the government has to pay for them.Lets say one million immigrants each get $30,000 worth of welfare benefits per year. Thats $30,000,000,000 of free welfare money sucked out of the American budget for people who put NOTHING back into our society, culture, or anything at all. That is literally a $0.00 return on investment. Not that people are a business, but thats really bad business. And as you can see, Germany has turned into a cesspool from all the migrants flooding the gates and ruining their nation.Prepare for a massive backlash from liberals, democrats, and activists. Theres sure to be protests regarding Trumps potential immigration policy.FOLLOW us on Facebook at Freedom Daily!"

In fact, due to its tilted and elliptical orbit, 2016 H03 is sometimes closer to the sun and moves faster than our planet and in other times its located farther out and moves slowly. However, researcher shave found it never gets closer to about 14 million kilometers from Earth, nor does it stray off course over 40 million kilometers. Earth new mini-moon is around 40 meters across and nearly 100 meters wide and will most likely remain as one of Earths smaller moon for coming centuries. The new moon was discovered thanks to the Pan-STARRS 1 asteroid survey telescope in Haleakala, Hawaii. Since 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth, said Paul Chodas, manager of NASAs Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. One other asteroid  2003 YN107  followed a similar orbital pattern for a while over ten years ago, but it has since departed our vicinity. This new asteroid is much more locked onto us. Our calculations indicate 2016 HO3 has been a stable quasi-satellite of Earth for almost a century, and it will continue to follow this pattern as Earths companion for centuries to come.

Now that Donald Trump is in office, however, hes blowing the lid open on the nations sleaziest scandals, and anything with Obamas name on it is being looked at. Recently, a long overdue raid was conducted in South Carolina, and what was discovered is worse than we initially thought. Freedom Daily reported that the owner of a Columbia, South Carolina gas station named after Obama has been arrested and charged with tax evasion. The Department of Revenue confirmed that Murad A. Alhanik, owner of the Obama Mart on North Main Street, has been charged with four counts of sales tax evasion. Officials say Alhanik did not pay more than $136,000 in sales taxes over four years, and that he evaded taxes by underreporting sales from 2013 to 2016. Alhanik filed monthly sales tax returns reporting a total of $971,935 in gross sales. However, the DOR investigation revealed actual sales to be $2,688,533. Due to the underreported sales, the defendant evaded paying $136,753 in sales taxes due to the state of South Carolina, the DOR said in a statement. Clearly, just like his idol Obama, Alhanik thought he was above the law. Alhanik is facing up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for each count. Alhanik bought the South Carolina gas station in 2011 and made headlines when he named it after Trump. He claimed that the rebranding resulted in an uptick of business. I see more people come in, Alhanik said. Excited with the name. In January of 2017, Alhanik boasted that he would not be changing the name of the store despite Obama not being president anymore because its still history. Were glad to see that Alhanik has finally been brought to justice. Hopefully, his idol Obama can join him in prison soon as well!"

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/may/01/newly-press/smallville-actress-didnt-confess-selling-children-/,"‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.  
According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.
Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.
The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.

“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”
When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.

Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.
In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.
The U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.

A quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.
Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.
Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.
Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.
Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.
In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is truly helping people, and that no one has ever been coerced as a part of their workshops.
Frank Parlato, a former NXIVM publicist-turned-whistleblower told the New York Post that Bronfman is among the harshest leaders in the organization.
“She’s the enforcer—the brutal one. Clare’s running the [operation] now, and she’s the most ruthless of them. I’m issuing an absolute warning now. Clare Bronfman is a true fanatic, and if there’s a Jim Jones situation, everyone will commit suicide but her.” Parlato said.
Of Allison Mack, Parlato said that she was a troubled woman, who was both a victim and an abuser.
“Mack was both a victim and a victimizer. She was both a mastermind and Raniere’s useful idiot. She started as a slave and she became a slave master. Her nickname among defectors is ‘Pimp Mack,‘” Parlato said.
It is highly possible that this is a position that Mack was groomed for since she was a child, as many childhood stars turn from victims to predators as a result of what they often experience behind the scenes in the industry. Oddly enough, one of Mack’s very first roles was in a softcore porn movie called “Night Eyes Three.” She was just 11 years old at the time.

I dont know if he had them vaccinated as adults, but I can tell you he point blank refused to vaccinate them as children, the physician said at a behind closed doors medical symposium in Seattle, adding They were gorgeous kids, really smart and vivacious, and he said they would be OK as it was, they didnt need any shots. The comments caused a stir among physicians at the symposium with claims he was breaking doctor-patient confidentiality, according to reports. However as he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct. Gates has three children with his wife Melinda  Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe  born between 1996 and 2002, and according to his former doctor, they are all unvaccinated and healthy. The news that Bill Gates does not vaccinate his own children, despite being the worlds most active campaigner for mandatory vaccinations, should come as no surprise. Studies prove that the elite do not vaccinate their children. But at the same time they expect the masses to have their children vaccinated. The elite do not vaccinate In California, the children most likely to be unvaccinated are white and come from the wealthiest families in Los Angeles, according to a recent study. The percentage of kindergartners with state-issued personal belief exemptions doubled from 2007 to 2013, from 1.54% to 3.06%. Thats about 17,000 of the wealthiest children, out of more than half a million, opting out of receiving vaccinations. Vaccine exemption percentages were highest in mostly white, high-income neighborhoods such as Orange County, Santa Barbara and parts of the Bay Area, according to CNN. The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Heath, looked at more than 6,200 California schools and found vaccine exemptions were twice as common among kindergartners attending private institutions. Very rich and privileged parents like the idea of herd immunity, but they dont want to take the risks associated with vaccinations when it comes to their own children. They are worried about adverse reactions including autism."
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/may/03/blog-posting/no-bill-gates-did-not-outline-2018-plan-depopulate/,"Bill Gates has doubled down on his goal to depopulate the planet, using deceitful Orwellian doublespeak in a new video to bamboozle his naive followers into believing that by making people healthier, we can reduce the worlds population. Make no mistake, when Gates talks about making people healthier, what he is really talking about is enforcing the mandatory roll out of his range of experimental vaccinations. The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents. The second-richest man on the planet is a committed globalist and eugenicist working towards the New World Order goal of depopulation. Lest anyone forget these facts, Bill Gates regularly goes out of his way to remind us of them. Bill Gates and his foundation have consistently come under fire for their goal of depopulation, and now the same man who admitted in a TED talk that his goal is to eliminate a billion humans from the face of the earth has now taken to Facebook to lecture us about why being eradicated is in our own interests. The irony of Bill Gates faux concern for the human race is almost laughable. India, however, may not find it so funny. Last year, Indias National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization announced that it would be banning the Gates Foundation from operating in the country after it was revealed that the vaccines the foundation had been promoting to make people healthier were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls  and that the Gates Foundation campaigns were actually experimental trials of the vaccines. Mainstream investigators have found that these vaccine trials in India led to thousands of injuries and deaths of young women. The philanthropist has also funded secretive sterilization programs, and says we should form death panels to differentiate between those who are worthy of life and those who have no benefit whatsoever to society. This cold, skewed psychopathic logic is terrifying and brings to mind the worst excesses of the 20th centurys most evil regimes. Now we are starting to see the horrific results of Gates depopulation agenda playing out around the world. Kenya doesnt find his Gates fake concern for the human race amusing either. In September of 2017 it was reported that at least 500,000 young Kenyan girls and women have been made sterile, following a tetanus vaccine administered by the government, and pushed by the international organizations in Bill Gates back pocket: Today, we can confirm to the country that the Catholic Church was right. Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women, aged between 14 and 49, from the fastest growing populations in the country will not have children, because of the state-sponsored sterilization that was sold to the country as tetanus vaccination, Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga declared. Gates, who has $23m of shares in Monsanto, is responsible for widespread vaccination programs which have been linked to outbreaks of disease in South America and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. GMOs and vaccinations have both been linked to human illness and death, even though Big Pharma and Big Ag continue to deny the undeniable correlations. Lets ask ourselves this: If Gates is focused on his goal of reducing the number of people on our planet, why would he then fund vaccination programs to save lives? None of this makes any sense, unless the vaccinations are not meant to save lives at all. Like this: Like Loading... Related More from Conspiracy"

Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations. While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London’s Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.

In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. “We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.

Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:

“The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.”

“It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.”

Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.

The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:

“There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “moderate” Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.”

Yes, that’s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow “intolerant.” Well do you know what most Americans think?

You’re damn right it’s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500’s AD? We shouldn’t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.

Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “unfair,” and “discriminates,” against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.

Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world, to be exact.

“Although Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.”

After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.

With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving."

Liberals were too quick to disperse this shocking picture, as proof of President Donald Trumps cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, theyre screwed. The answer, naturally, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the presidents work. That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible. Within the course of Trumps period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. Theyve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are. Liberals didnt hesitate to question his childrens psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped. That is not even mentioning the numerous times that left handed outlets edited videos or photos to create Trump look like a poor guy. However, what they did that this weekend actually takes the cake. A photo went viral throughout Twitter. The dreadful picture depicted arrested illegal immigrants. These individuals  arrested by our government  were made to stay in cages resembling dog kennels. It is too bad that these liberals did not bother to check the date on the film. Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted conversation, linked to a AZCentral.com article titled,First glance of immigrant kids at holding facility and saidThis is occurring right now, and the only argument that issue is the way we force our government to get these kids back to their families as quickly as possible His obvious intent was to slam the Trump government for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source: Twitchy] Jon Favreau was among many liberals who assaulted Trump within this injustice. The famous Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he understood how better things were under the last government, right? This liberal celebrity is likely horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, that could let something as bad as this: How dreadful! Certainly the guy responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible. But wait, lets look at the initial post. It was from ACCentral.com. As stated by the date, this was composed in 2014. Thats right, liberals. This photograph you are so outraged more than was taken through Obamas administration. Liberals were not storming Twitter with demands for change. They were not calling Obama racist for treating kids like this. Why werent the overlords inside the mainstream press requiring answers from his government? Appears like liberals didnt care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they accuse Trump of racism, dependent on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism. He is not treating illegals like creatures. However, while Trump calls vile MS-13 membersanimals, Obama was treating children like creatures. Really makes you think. Liberals, in their own feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed among Obamas numerous sins. And their own. They pretend to care, as a response to Trumps stance on immigration. Before Trump suggested the wall, liberals did not think twice about illegals. We all know that for a fact since this article has been around for FOUR decades, and they have said nothing.

This week, Rudy Giuliani threw the nation a major curveball when he contradicted the presidents story in an interview with Fox News. He later tried to clean up the mess by claiming that Donald was only trying to protect his marriage by burying the false allegations against him. Following Rudys interview, Trump posted a multi-part tweet that had desperation written all over it. He posted the tweetstorm shortly before delivering his National Day of Prayer speech. During the event, people quickly noticed Melanias absence. Did Giulianis already-infamous interview humiliate Melania to the point that she decided to avoid the event altogether?

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/may/10/revolution-radio/california-lawmaker-called-assault-weapons-ban-not/,"A California Democrat was recently given a platform by USA Today to publish a shocking editorial that calls for nationwide confiscation of all military-style semiautomatic assault weapons from law-abiding citizens. Representative Eric Swalwell from Californias 15th District wrote that all so-called assault weapons need to be banned, and that a federal gun buy-back program needs to be instituted in order to effectively collect them all from the citizenry. Rep. Swalwell even goes a step further, insisting that those who refuse to hand over their assault weapons be criminally prosecuted  including law-abiding gun owners who have never been convicted of committing a crime with their legally-purchased weaponry. Not content to simply impose a fresh ban on all new assault weapon purchases, which in and of itself is unconstitutional, Rep. Swalwell actually wants to see door-to-door gun confiscation teams engage in Nazi-style removal tactics in order to rid the streets of all firearms that he personally deems reckless and unnecessary. Reinstating the federal assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 would prohibit manufacture and sales, but it would not affect weapons already possessed, Rep. Swalwell wrote in his op-ed for USA Today. This would leave millions of assault weapons in our communities for decades to come. Instead, we should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons.

This defensive strategy is recommended by nearly all health authorities, worldwide, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Discover more at this link. Democrats like Rep. Swalwell are enemies of the Constitution, and enemies of We the People Despite the fact that the United States is currently more than $21 trillion in debt, Rep. Swalwell wants to see as much as $15 billion apportioned as part of his plan to seize all assault weapons from law-abiding Americans. Hes now proposing that the owners of such weapons be given $1,000 per gun to hand them all over to government officials. Its a lunatic idea, of course  but then again, when have Democrats ever proposed something that made sense both from a logical and a practical perspective? The nations roads, bridges, and other infrastructure is crumbling, and the only thing that people like Rep. Swalwell can think about is funding efforts to try to eliminate the Second Amendment. Commenting on the proposal, Orange County Register writer Sal Rodriguez points out that Rep. Swalwell obviously doesnt know anything about firearms, nor is he aware of the fact that theres no such thing as an assault weapon. While I think the idea of banning assault weapons  a category of firearm which only exists in the minds of people who dont know anything about firearms, based purely on what said people think a military-style weapon might look like  is a pointless exercise in government overreach, at least Swalwell is up front and honest, Rodriguez writes. Unlike Sen. Dianne Feinsteins proposal to merely ban the future sale of assault weapons, Swalwell explicitly wants to criminalize any gun which looks scary to him and is willing to spend billions of dollars towards that end and imprison anyone who doesnt hand over their lawfully acquired firearms. What this all suggests is that Rep. Swalwell, and others like him, arent at all interested in truth or facts. They have one agenda on their plate, and thats to chip away at  and eventually completely eliminate  the Second Amendment right of Americans to own the firearms of their choice. This further makes Rep. Swalwell an enemy of this Constitutional Republic, as well as an enemy of We the People who own and operate it.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/may/10/washingtonsources/no-trump-didnt-vote-death-penalty-gay-people/,"President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (its hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote. A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The resolution wasnt sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a discriminatory manner, particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia. While some are saying that a no vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations. To have a no vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries. Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this. Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said: It is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love. This is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end. Since taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including: Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity. Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order. Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly. Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights."
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/may/15/political-voice/no-rudy-giuliani-didnt-quit-trump-legal-team/,"After Trumps lead dog attorney, John Dowd, up and quit, the president ran into trouble trying to find his replacement. After a long list of failed attempts to bring on high-profile attorneys, Trump ultimately settled on former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani. However, things havent gone quite as expected since the inception of Giuliani. Hes caused the president more harm than good, notably when he contradicted the presidents story regarding the hush payment sent to Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. Now, it appears that instead of getting kicked off the team by Trump, the president is desperate enough to need Rudy in a full-time role. On April 19th, Rudy officially went on leave from the law firm Greenberg Traurig. Today, the executive chairman of the firm, Richard Rosenbaum, announced that Rudy has formally resigned from the firm. Rosenbaum said in a statement: When Rudy Giuliani took an unpaid leave of absence from the firm, his intent was to play a limited role, for a short period of time, to address specific matters for President Trump. After recognizing that this work is all consuming and is lasting longer than initially anticipated, Rudy has determined it is best for him to resign from the firm, effective May 9th. I have a great deal of respect [for him]  and consider him a friend. The key takeaway is the fact that Trump is desperate enough to need throwaway lawyer Rudy Giuliani.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/may/17/blog-posting/prince-william-plans-go-royal-wedding-contrary-spe/,"No one likely ever thought that Prince William would miss his little brother's wedding. Sadly, it might just happen. The latest news from sources is that Prince William is in the middle of a huge predicament, one that could change relationships. Prince William has to choose to either go to Prince Harry's wedding and stand by his side as the best man or choose to attend a soccer game. While for most of us it seems like an easy choice. Family over soccer. However, for Prince William, it won't be so easy. Saturday is not just the big Royal wedding; it's also England's Football Association Cup final against Manchester United and Chelsea. He is expected to be there. Knowing what we know about Prince William, he would rather be at the wedding than at a soccer game. However, it's not just a soccer game and he's not just a spectator, he's the FA president. He has been for over a decade. Each and every year, the FA president is expected to be in attendance at the final game at Wembley Stadium. The president's job is also to award the final cup trophy to the winning team. This long-standing tradition and a popular England sporting event will be a hard one for Prince William to miss. While this quandary isn't unexpected news to Prince William, he's been thinking about it for months. In an interview with radio broadcaster Rio Ferdinand in January, he expressed his upcoming dilemma. Its a big decision, are we going to Wembley, or are we going to...? William asking Rio. Youve touched on something there, Rio, yeah. Im still working it out. Ill see what I can do. Even though both events are happening the same day, he may be able to attend both. The wedding is at noon, and the soccer game is at 5:30 p.m. Being 20 miles apart from each other, he could attend the reception at St. George's Chapel and take his helicopter to Wembley to present the trophy. After that, he could travel back to the evening reception at the Frogmore House. There is no final word yet as to what Prince William will do. Let's hope he can pull it off! Do you think he can? Let us know in the comment section! _LINKS_ In other news, a famous athlete dies in a horrendous car crash after dropping his kids off at school. The family is requesting prayers."

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/may/23/blog-posting/false-claim-jeff-sessions-caught-collud/,"JUST IN: Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ future in Donald Trump’s White House is in jeopardy after new reports have indicated that he has been taking advise from members of Barack Obama’s administration.

The Gateway Pundit reported that back in March of 2017, Sessions announced that he would recuse himself from investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign including the alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. He reportedly made this announcement just one day after he was sworn in as Attorney General after advice from Obama lawyers in the Department of Justice.

Last night, Fox News contributor and legal expert Gregg Jarrett told Sean Hannity that Sessions actually used the wrong law when he announced his recusal after Obama officials purposely misled him.
“He betrayed the president,” Jarrett said. “He knew when he was sworn in that he was going to recuse himself and the very next day he put the recusal in motion. He never told the president about that. And by the way he cited the regulation in his recusal… He cited the wrong law. It didn’t apply.”

“I think he was being advised badly at the time,” contributor Sara interjected.
“Yeah, by Obama’s holdovers. Who in the world would believe them?” Jarrett said.

This comes as rumors are swirling that Trump is considering firing Sessions, as the president is still frustrated at him for recusing himself from the Russia probe.

“Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else,” Trump said last summer.

Last weekend, Sessions said he stands by his decision to step down from the investigation.

“I think that’s what I had to do,” Sessions said."
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/may/23/yournewswirecom/no-cnn-isnt-closing-after-ratings-drop/,"CNN is on the verge of permanently closing its doors after its ratings collapsed even more than last week, falling a staggering 30 percent in the second week of May. While Fox News increased its total viewers by a healthy 6 percent and MSNBC held steady, CNNs viewership took a nosedive, signalling that the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end. Breitbart.com reports: While no one in the media want to talk about it, CNNs relentless fake news sprees have not only created a massive credibility problem for the hate network, the far-left cable channels ratings crisis is even more severe. CNN lies. Numbers do not Last week, during the all-important primetime hours, CNN was only able to average 844K total viewers. During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse. CNNs average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K. In other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers. Fox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNNs 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNNs 635K. While MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers. Incredibly, CNNs second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K. Compared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo. During the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K. In total day, the damage was -34 percent, from 274K demo viewers to a humiliating 183K. By comparison, Fox News averaged 492K demo viewers during primetime (almost double CNN) and 296K demo viewers during the total day. MSNBC averaged 326K demo viewers during primetime and 190K during total day. The third week of May is already looking like it could be even worse for CNN. On Monday, despite the massive news surrounding the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, CNN averaged a dismal 643K total day viewers, compared to Fox and MSNBCs 1.76 million and 1.13 million, respectively. During primetime Monday, CNN could only attract a scant 765K total viewers. Fox nearly quadrupled CNN with 2.89 million viewers. MSNBC more than doubled CNN with 1.93 million. The bottom line is that CNNs ongoing and well-documented credibility crisis has now come home to roost as a five-alarm ratings crisis."

The tweet reads warning: Youre all going down. You know who you are. Mark my word. Youre all going down. You know who you are. Mark my word.  MFLYNNJR (@mflynnJR) May 21, 2018 ts now being reported that less than a week after Stefan Halper was confirmed to be an informant for the FBI who was the one who infiltrated the Trump campaign back in 2016, there is now alleged confirmation that the 73-year-old Oxford University professor and former U.S. government official was paid handsomely by the Obama administration starting in 2012 for various research projects. Halper, who is said to be a longtime CIA and FBI asset, once even reportedly ran a spy-operation on the Jimmy Carter administration during the late 70s, was recruited by the FBI to spy on several Trump campaign aides during the 2016 U.S. election. But here is the kicker. An astringent search of public records is now revealing that between 2012 and 2018, Halper received a total of $1,058,161 from the Department of Defense. Why would anyone receive that kind of money from the DOJ? Especially someone like Halper? Stefan Halper was the same person who invited George Papadopolous to London, where he just so happened to sit down next to that infamous Australian Diplomat (who also worked with the Clinton Foundation)  Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018 In essence, Stefan Halper was the bag-man who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obamas request  Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018 Interestingly enough, the most recent payment to Halper for $411,575 was made in two different installments which had a start date of September 26, 2016, only three days after a September 23 news article by Michael Isikoff was published about Trump aide Carter Page. The article used information fed to Isikoff by the fake Russian dossier creator Christopher Steele. It was later confirmed that the FBI used that article, along with the unverified Russian dossier as supporting evidence in a FISA warrant application for Page. Via 100% Fed Up: According to the Website USASPENDING.gov, the payments to Halper are for RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES (2012), RESEARCH AND STUDIES  THE YEAR 2030, (2014), RUSSIA-CHINA RELATIONSHIP STUDY. (2015), and INDIA AND CHINA ECON STUDY (2016). Halpers most recent award was noted recently by Trump supporter Jacob Wohl, which piqued the interest of internet researchers who continued the analysis. Stefan Halper was the same person who invited George Papadopolous to London, where he just so happened to sit down next to that infamous Australian Diplomat (who also worked with the Clinton Foundation)  Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018 Wohl calls Stefan Halper the bag man who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obamas request: In essence, Stefan Halper was the bag-man who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obamas request  Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018 The second installment of Halpers 2016 DoD contract is dated July 26, 2017 in the amount of $129,280  around three months before the FISA warrant on Carter Page was set to expire following repeated renewals signed by Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein and a federal judge. On July 28, he emailed Page with what the Trump campaign aide describes as a cordial communication, which did not seem suspicious to him at the time. In the email to Page, Halper asks what his plans are post-election, possibly probing for more information. It seems attention has shifted a bit from the collusion investigation to the  contretempts [sic] within the White House and, howor ifMr. Scaramucci will be accommodated there, Halper wrote. How much time has the MSM spent talking about the massive cash payments sent to Stefan Halper to spy on our President? ZERO.  Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 21, 2018 Halper approached Page during an election-themed conference at Cambridge on July 11, 2016, six weeks before the September 26 Department of Justice payment start date. They would remain in contact for the next 14 months where they frequently met and exchanged emails. Here is the infamous article via Yahoo News: U.S. intelligence officials are seeking to determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications with senior Russian officials  including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue. The activities of Trump adviser Carter Page, who has extensive business interests in Russia, have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and high ranking sanctioned individuals in Moscow over the summer as evidence of significant and disturbing ties between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau. Some of those briefed were taken aback when they learned about Pages contacts in Moscow, viewing them as a possible back channel to the Russians that could undercut U.S. foreign policy, said a congressional source familiar with the briefings but who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. The source added that U.S. officials in the briefings indicated that intelligence reports about the advisers talks with senior Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin were being actively monitored and investigated. A senior U.S. law enforcement official did not dispute that characterization when asked for comment by Yahoo News. Its on our radar screen, said the official about Pages contacts with Russian officials. Its being looked at. Page is a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow who now runs a New York consulting firm, Global Energy Capital, located around the corner from Trump Tower, that specializes in oil and gas deals in Russia and other Central Asian countries. He declined repeated requests to comment for this story. Trump first mentioned Pages name when asked to identify his foreign policy team during an interview with the Washington Post editorial team last March. Describing him then only as a PhD, Trump named Page as among five advisers that we are dealing with. But his precise role in the campaign remains unclear; Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks last month called him an informal foreign adviser who does not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign. Asked this week by Yahoo News, Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said Page has no role and added: We are not aware of any of his activities, past or present. Miller did not respond when asked why Trump had previously described Page as one of his advisers. The questions about Page come amid mounting concerns within the U.S. intelligence community about Russian cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and state election databases in Arizona and Illinois. In a rare public talk this week, former undersecretary of defense for intelligence Mike Vickers said that the Russian cyberattacks constituted meddling in the U.S. election and were beyond the pale. Also, this week, two senior Democrats  Sen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking minority member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking minority member on the House Intelligence Committee  released a joint statement that went further then what U.S. officials had publicly said about the matter. Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election, they said. At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election. They added that orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government. Page came to the attention of officials at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow several years ago when he showed up in the Russian capital during several business trips and made provocative public comments critical of U.S. policy and sympathetic to Putin. He was pretty much a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did, said one U.S. official who served in Russia at the time. He hasnt been shy about expressing those views in the U.S. as well. Last March, shorty after he was named by Trump as one of his advisers, Page told Bloomberg News he had been an adviser to, and investor in, Gazprom, the Russian state-owned gas company. He then blamed Obama administration sanctions  imposed as a response to the Russian annexation of Crimea  for driving down the companys stock. So many people who I know and have worked with have been so adversely affected by the sanctions policy, Page said in the interview. Theres a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation. Page showed up again in Moscow in early July, just two weeks before the Republican National Convention formally nominated Trump for president, and once again criticized U.S. policy. Speaking at a commencement address for the New Economic School, an institution funded in part by major Russian oligarchs close to Putin, Page asserted that Washington and other West capitals had impeded progress in Russia through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change. At the time, Page declined to say whether he was meeting with Russian officials during his trip, according to a Reuters report. But U.S. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip, Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft, Russians leading oil company, a well-placed Western intelligence source tells Yahoo News. That meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by U.S. officials because the Treasury Department in August 2014 named Sechin to a list of Russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over Russias illegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine. (The Treasury announcement described Sechin as utterly loyal to Vladimir Putin  a key component to his current standing. At their alleged meeting, Sechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with Page, the Western intelligence source said. U.S. intelligence agencies have also received reports that Page met with another top Putin aide while in Moscow  Igor Diveykin. A former Russian security official, Diveykin now serves as deputy chief for internal policy and is believed by U.S. officials to have responsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S. election, the Western intelligence source said.

http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2011/jun/05/john-tassoni-jr/state-sen-john-tassoni-says-central-falls-school-s/,"STATE HOUSE – Angered by reports of fiscal mismanagement and administrative malfeasance, Sen. John J. Tassoni Jr. (D-Dist. 22, Smithfield, North Smithfield) is calling for major changes in the operation of the Central Falls school system, beginning with a call for the immediate resignation of Superintendent Frances Gallo.

“In addition to the various stories that have already been published about the problems with the operation of the Central Falls school system, I have become aware of many more issues that have convinced me that what is needed is a complete overhaul of how the schools are operating in that city,” said Senator Tassoni. “That must begin with the immediate resignation of the current superintendent.”

Senator Tassoni said he also wants the current board of trustees to be replaced, with new individuals named by the governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The members of the board are currently appointed by the Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education. Senator Tassoni said he intends to meet with President of the Senate M. Teresa Paiva Weed and Sen. Elizabeth A. Crowley (D-Dist. 16, Central Falls, Cumberland, Pawtucket) to determine how to address the matter legislatively.

“The management of the Central Falls schools is erratic at best and incompetent at worst,” said Senator Tassoni. “The state is operating the schools. State money is being used to operate the schools, and some of that money is being wasted and used irresponsibly. The state needs to step in and correct the many problems so that the children of Central Falls receive a proper education.”

Senator Tassoni said his concerns about the operation of Central Falls schools increase every time he becomes aware of another problem, “and there seems to be no end to the number of reports coming out of the school system that indicate the people in charge either do not know what they are doing or don’t care.”

Among those issues, he said, is a recent report that three top administrators in the school system who have not been working for months are still on the payroll, all making six-figure salaries.

In addition, Senator Tassoni said he has learned that the department spent $100,000 on a time clock, “when there are certainly better ways to spend the state’s money, such as providing the best education for the children of Central Falls.”

Also, he said, an individual who lost his teaching job in Providence due to erratic behavior was given a job in the Central Falls school system, despite lacking a teaching certificate, and administrators tried to cover up that incident.

“I am angry for a number of reasons,” said Senator Tassoni. “Certainly, my first concern is that Central Falls schools are not being operated in a way that focuses on providing a good education for the students. But I am also concerned that the state, which is operating and financing the schools, is not doing enough to make sure things are operating properly. The individuals at the state level who should be paying attention are either not being thorough enough in their oversight or are simply accepting the word of the board of trustees that everything is just fine, when it is not.”

“We need a clean sweep of the current administration, starting with the resignation of the superintendent and replacement of the existing board,” he said. “Perhaps with proper management, the children of Central Falls will receive a proper education and the state will get some value from the money it is spending on the city’s school system.”

“There is precious little fiscal accountability in the Central Falls school system under the current management set-up,” he said. “That must change now.”

http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/03/peter-palumbo/palumbo-says-there-are-500000-registered-sex-offen/,"STATE HOUSE – Legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives to set sex offender registration and notification requirements in Rhode Island, move the responsibility of sex offender registry to the Rhode Island State Police and remove the subjectivity of the current offender Tier assessment system and replace it with an offense-based tier system.

Introduced by Rep. Peter G. Palumbo (D-Dist. 16, Cranston), the legislation, (2011-H5129), creates the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), which complies with the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. (The act was named for Adam Walsh, a boy who was abducted from a Florida mall and later found murdered.)

“The intent of this legislation is to strengthen Rhode Island laws regarding sex offender registration and notification, to make sure that any gaps in our laws are plugged and to make sure our state laws help strengthen the nationwide network of offender notification and registration,” said Representative Palumbo.

“Across the nation, there are nearly 500,000 registered sex offenders and at any one time about 100,000 of them are unaccounted for,” said Representative Palumbo, who co-chaired a legislative commission studying ways to improve and strengthen the state’s sex offender laws. “As long as there is one sex offender out there that we cannot account for, there is the potential for great harm, the potential for another victim.”

The Palumbo legislation – similar to a bill he introduced last year that was passed by the House but was not acted upon by the Senate -- repeals a section of state law dealing with sex offender registration and replaces it with a new, more comprehensive offender registration and community notification act.

The new legislation will require registered sex offenders to register and keep their registration current in the jurisdictions in which they live, work or go to school. It will require sex offenders to provide more extensive registration information (including phone numbers, residence addresses, temporary lodging information, professional licenses, vehicle information, criminal history, fingerprints, DNA).

Under the bill, incarcerated sex offenders must be registered before their release from imprisonment or, in the case of a non-imprisonment sentence, within three business days of sentencing for the registration offense. The bill also requires sex offenders to make periodic in person appearances to verify and update registration information (every year for 15 years for Tier I offenders; every 180 days for 25 years for Tier II offenders; every 90 days for the rest of their lives for Tier III offenders), and expands the amount of information available to the public regarding registered sex offenders.

The legislation will also move full responsibility of the sex offender registry and notification to the Rhode Island State Police/Department of Public Safety, putting all the functions under one agency. Currently, the State Police, Attorney General’s office, Department of Corrections and Parole Board have responsibilities under the various sex offender statutes.

“We have done a lot in the past few years in Rhode Island to strengthen our sex offender laws, and especially those involving crimes against children. But there are still gaps that need to be addressed,” he said. “This legislation closes those gaps, not only for those currently serving time for sex offenses but also those who have completed their incarceration or who are appealing their sex offender tier level, and those who re-enter the system through a subsequent criminal conviction.”

Approval of the SORNA legislation and its enactment into law is also of fiscal concern to the state, said Representative Palumbo. Federal enactment of the Adam Walsh Act required all state to comply with the provisions of SORNA. Those that failed to substantially implement SORNA by 2009 faced a mandatory 10 percent reduction in funding under the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant, which provides support for state programs in public safety, corrections, the judiciary and other areas.

Rhode Island had already been granted an extension on implementation until July of 2010, and the state reapplied for an extension until July, 2011. Fiscal year 2011 projected funding for Rhode Island under the Byrne Grant is $1.9 million.

In addition, the Rhode Island State Police has received a $203,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice to begin the implementation process, contingent upon enactment of the law this year.

Representative Palumbo spearheaded Rhode Island’s enactment of Megan’s Law, which requires the state’s parole board and courts to evaluate all sexual offenders leaving prison and determine the risk posed to the community, and also Jessica’s Law, which requires first-degree child molesters and Level 3 sex offenders to wear a global positioning system monitor.

“As comprehensive as this legislation is, it is still just about one thing – keeping people, and especially young people, safe from sexual offenders and predators,” said Representative Palumbo. “Our state has earned compliments for the work it has done in this area, but we can’t stop trying to make our laws better and keep our citizens safer.”

The Palumbo bill has been referred to the House Committee on Judiciary. It is co-sponsored by Rep. John G. Edwards (D-Dist. 70, Tiverton, Portsmouth), Rep. Gregory J. Schadone (D-Dist. 54, North Providence), Rep. Arthur J. Corvese (D-Dist. 55, North Providence) and Rep. Jon D. Brien (D-Dist. 50, Woonsocket).

http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/27/jon-brien/rep-brien-says-woonsocket-needs-garbage-burning-po/,"STATE HOUSE – Rep. Jon D. Brien believes Woonsocket should be allowed to turn its trash into a valuable commodity – energy – and has introduced legislation that would enable the city to open its own waste-to-energy plant.

“Every year we hear about how we’re running out of room at the landfill. Meanwhile, residents are paying through the nose for electricity that’s fueled by foreign oil, at prices that are skyrocketing. It makes no sense to continue tossing our trash when we could be solving both problems by incinerating it to produce energy,” said Representative Brien, a Democrat who represents District 50 in Woonsocket.

The bill (2011-H 5315) is scheduled for a hearing on Thursday before the Municipal Government Committee, which Representative Brien chairs.

The legislation would remove a ban on waste-to-energy projects in Rhode Island, and allow one in Woonsocket, provided it comply with all federal, state and local laws, including environmental and health codes, and it receive approval from the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation.

Synagro, a Texas-based business that operates a solid waste facility in Woonsocket, is incinerating sludge on a daily basis in Woonsocket and Representative Brien says he believes incineration should be explored as a way to eliminate the need for continual expansion of the state’s Central Landfill, while reducing Rhode Island’s dependence on foreign oil.

“Just this month the Central Landfill received a permit to expand another 100-plus acres, which will be enough room for just 17 more years’ worth of our state’s garbage. Rhode Island is just going to keep polluting more and more land with no end in sight unless we look for alternative means to dispose of our trash. What I’m proposing is a way for us to stop dumping while generating our own renewable energy so we don’t have to rely as much on high-priced oil from foreign countries. It is totally illogical to insist that it we should be burying our trash, rather than transforming it into a viable alternative energy resource,” said Representative Brien.

According to the Energy Recovery Council, a national trade group of waste-to-energy businesses, last year 86 waste-to-energy plants operated in 24 states with the capacity to process more than 97,000 tons of municipal solid waste per day.

http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/29/travis-rowley/republican-travis-rowley-says-martin-luther-king-j/,"Democrats have been running our inner-cities for the past 30 to 40 years, and blacks are still complaining about the same problems. More than 7 trillion dollars have been spent on poverty programs since Lyndon Johnsons War on Poverty with little, if any, impact on poverty. Diabolically, every election cycle, Democrats blame Republicans for the deplorable conditions in the inner-cities, then incite blacks to cast a protest vote against Republicans.  Frances Rice, Chairman of the National Black Republican Association Not that liberals ever relent in their shallow quest to widely characterize Republicans as racist, but the Democratic race-baiters seemed to be particularly busy this past week. Here in Rhode Island we saw Rep. Charlene Lima (D - Cranston) join a chorus of Democrats across the country when she likened Rhode Islands new Voter ID law to Jim Crow policies. Last summer Rep. Jon Brien (D  Woonsocket) informed everyone on A Lively Experiment that the National Democratic Congressional Committee had been contacting Rhode Island Democrats, pressuring them to reject the anticipated Voter ID bill. According to Brien, they didnt want to pass this legislation because you will mess up [the Democratic] paradigm. The paradigm isthe Republicans, those nasty people, are trying to bring us all the way back to the Jim Crow laws. I guess Representative Lima got the memo. The Left continued their obsession with race this week when New York Times columnist Lee Siegel wrote that Mitt Romney is the whitest white man to run for president in recent memory, and that that is the one quality that has subtly fueled his candidacy thus far and could well put him over the top in the fall. Liberals always revert back to their default position: America is racist. In a time when it is arguably a political advantage to be anything but white, and just several years after the election of a black president, Siegel somehow views a black mans chances in a presidential election equal to that of a Martian. Sure, President Obama defeated a white man in 2008. But John McCain has nothing on Mitt Romney. At least not in terms of his whiteness! This is really how liberals think. South Carolina Also deciding to illustrate that race is never a factor until Democrats decide to inject it into the discussion was chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party Dick Harpootlian, who criticized Republicans for holding their debate in South Carolina on Martin Luther King Day: The Republicans are scheduling their debate [for] Monday, Martin Luther King Day, without any regard, whatsoever, [for] the civil rights issues that this state has faced[Romney should say] 'no, I don't want to have a debate on Martin Luther King's birthday, that's a day we need to celebrate a great American leader.'"" When it was revealed that, in 2008, the Congressional Black Caucus also hosted a Democratic presidential debate on MLK Day, Harpootlian shifted his argument to another false proclamation, claiming that Republicans hadnt bothered to even recognize the holiday or approach the black community in South Carolina. Harpootlian denied that he ever said hosting a debate on MLK Day was improper, but instead had merely argued that it is indicative of a process in which [Republicans] have not engaged the African-American community in this state. Just like that, Harpootlian was right back where he started: Republicans are racist. Blacks made up only two percent of Republican primary voters in South Carolina in 2008. Maybe if Democrats stopped lying to black people by constantly insinuating that Republicans hate them, then perhaps there would be an actual base of black Republicans that Republican candidates could speak to during competitive, small-turnout primary elections. It seems like a fitting moment to remind everyone that Martin Luther King was a Republican and, if alive, would probably have come to his own partys defense by telling Harpootlian to stop being such a whiny, hyper-sensitive, little weasel. And to stop pandering black people to death. Stopping Republicans From Helping Minorities Ironically, by disingenuously retreating from his race-baiting comments, Harpootlian came across as if he actually wanted Republicans to steal black voters away from the Democratic Party. But the last thing Democrats want is for Republicans to be anywhere near minority neighborhoods, speaking candidly and revealing to minorities the damage that Democratic policies have done to their communities. For Democrats, its best to just continue fostering an awkward relationship of mistrust between Republicans and minorities. When Mitt Romney was approached last week by Ruth Williams, an unemployed woman in South Carolina who asked Romney for financial help, Williams reported that [Romney] got money and he paid for my light bill. But because Williams is black, a Miami Herald reporter was horrified by the incident: As an African-American woman it galls me. I dont even like to watch it. I felt like it plays into every sort of patronizing stereotype of black people. Have the government give them anything they want. Just dont show me a black person receiving personal charity. Its too painful! Republicans cant help black people. Democrats get too offended. Race-obsessed and on a perpetual mission to smear Republicans as racist, when Newt Gingrich called Barack Obama the best food-stamp president in American history liberals were the ones who insisted on conjuring up images of black food-stamp recipients  accusing Gingrich of racial insensitivity despite the fact that most food-stamp recipients are white. Liberal Fox News reporter Juan Williams tried to get Gingrich to acknowledge that his words were particularly [insulting] to black Americans during last Mondays debate. Gingrichs response: First of all, Juan, more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in history. I know among the politically correct you're not supposed to use facts that are uncomfortable. But Williams went on to argue that, when speaking about black people in particularly, Gingrich did say at one point that black Americans should demand jobs, not food stamps. Only Democrats could be insulted by such a message. Poverty is the condition that makes someone eligible for food-stamps. And a job is the way out of poverty. While Republicans explain how Democratic policies destroy economic opportunity, and then point out a pathway to prosperity, all Democrats can do in the face of such criticism is to remind black people to be insulted  which has gotten them absolutely nowhere ever since they migrated under the Democratic banner several decades ago.

http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/24/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-women-earn-only-77-per/,"Washington  U.S. Congressman David Cicilline (D-RI), who has co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act in the House, today called on House Republicans to help close the wage gap that still exists between women and men in the workforce. Nearly a century since suffrage was achieved, women continue to lag behind men in terms of compensation in the workplace. It is unacceptable that women continue to earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position. In many families, women have grown increasingly responsible for household income, and we must work to ensure that their pay keeps pace with their participation in the job market, said Cicilline. In January 2009, the Democratic-led 111th Congress sent to the Presidents desk the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act  and it became the first bill signed into law by President Obama. This Act, a great victory for women, restores the right of women to challenge unfair pay in court  but virtually all House Republicans rejected this critical measure for women. Cicilline, who was sworn into office in January 2011, has continued to press for additional measures to protect equal pay for women. While the Lilly Ledbetter Act marked a significant achievement there is still more work to be done. I am a proud cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would enhance the remedies available under the Equal Pay Act to better to better equip women fighting against wage discrimination. Although the House Republican leadership has failed to consider this measure, I will continue to stand up with the other members of our states delegation to promote progress for Rhode Island women and their families, added Cicilline. This year, Equal Pay Day also falls on Tax Day. Just as Cicilline is fighting to achieve equal pay for women in the workforce, he is also fighting for basic fairness in the tax code. While women are struggling in the workplace with unfair pay, it adds insult to injury that many workers with modest incomes are actually paying a higher tax rate than their well-paid bosses. That is why Congressman Cicilline, who authored a letter to Speaker Boehner last week urging the House to enact a Buffett Rule, today reiterated the importance of ensuring that multimillion dollar earners no longer pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than middle class Rhode Island families."
http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/28/harold-metts/ri-state-sen-harold-m-metts-says-voters-were-promi/,"STATE HOUSE – Sen. Harold M. Metts (D-Dist. 6, Providence) knows that Rhode Island voters will be asked in the November election if they favor casino-style (table) games at Twin River in Lincoln. He expects they will also face the same question about Newport Grand.

Although no one can predict what voters will decide, Senator Metts knows that any proposed expansion in gambling in Rhode Island is an effort to grow gambling revenues at the two facilities, and consequently increase the amount the state already receives from gaming, and to mitigate any potential drain on those revenues when casinos go on line in Massachusetts.

Saying it “would be a positive step toward honoring years of promises to fund education with gaming revenue,” Senator Metts has introduced legislation that would require any additional state revenues gained from the expansion of gambling to be used solely to support elementary and secondary education in the state.

While some of the gaming revenue the state receives may find its way to education, it first must pass through the state’s General Fund, explained Senator Metts. “What comes out, for education, is not what comes in from gaming revenue. That’s a shame, and it’s sad, considering the very real concerns that have been raised in recent years about the quality of our state’s educational system,” he said. “Our school children need better and they deserve better.”

Senator Metts said he believes enacting his legislation will address concerns raised at several economic summits in the past year, concerning the state’s need for an educated work force. “An educated work force is key to our economic recovery and growth, and in order for this to occur, we need to make sure our education system is well funded.”

Senator Metts is not and has not been a proponent of gambling, “but since it is here – in the form of lottery tickets and VLTs – and since it may grow into full-fledged casinos, it is imperative that we commit some of those funds to education – not just because it was promised, but because it is vital to our school children and the long-range health of our state.”

“Clearly, if Massachusetts casinos impact us negatively, there may not be a great deal of additional gambling revenues. But assuming that there are, and that the goal of expansion is to bring in more money, those extra funds should go right to educating our children.”

Senator Metts said he remembers the birth of the Lottery in Rhode Island, when state residents were enticed to vote for it with the promise that the money would be used for education. “We have a chance to do that now, with this bill,” he said. “Doing this is not just about making good on earlier promises. Doing this is giving our school children the best education we can provide. That means giving them all a chance to succeed and that means giving our state a much better chance to succeed.”

The bill specifies that additional gambling funds will be deposited in a restricted account to fund elementary and secondary education, but that those funds will not reduce current federal and/or state funding levels not reduce the amount of the state’s share of permanent foundation education aid.

The Metts bill, (2012-S2737), is before the Senate Committee on Special Legislation and Veterans’ Affairs. It is co-sponsored by Sen. Juan M. Pichardo (D-Dist. 2, Providence), Sen. Paul V. Jabour (D-Dist. 5, Providence), Sen. Elizabeth A. Crowley (D-Dist. 16, Central Falls, Cumberland, Pawtucket) and Sen. Joshua Miller (D-Dist. 28, Cranston, Warwick).

ROCHESTER, Minn. The Service Employees International Union recently filed a petition with the Rhode Island Labor Relations Board seeking the right to exclusively represent and bargain on behalf of home-based child-care providers. These providers, who typically run their small businesses out of their homes, are not the first to face this new and controversial type of unionization. As a Minnesota family child-care provider, I was first approached by the SEIU in 2006 when an unknown man walked into my home, uninvited, asking me to sign a petition to the state for health insurance. He was persistent and wouldnt take no for an answer. After arguing with me for some time, he finally left the petition for me to look over and sign with the understanding that he would be back later to retrieve it. When I had time to read the fine print, I was shocked to see the word union. He neither identified his union affiliation nor disclosed that the card had anything to do with unionization. The tactics used in an attempt to gain my signature left me feeling violated. After speaking with other child-care providers throughout Minnesota and eventually in other states, I learned that my experience was far from isolated. Nearly every provider I spoke with believed that by signing this card they would receive more information about obtaining health care, increased training opportunities, or increasing child-care reimbursement rates. I couldnt find any who were fully informed that signing that card meant they supported unionization or wanted to join the SEIU. To learn more of the costs and potential benefits, we attended union-sponsored informational meetings and were full of questions  most of which went unanswered. Those who asked too many questions were often escorted out of meetings by union representatives. Since the union refused to answer our questions, we formed a coalition and began researching child-care unionization on our own, collecting such basic facts as the cost of dues, how child-care unions were formed and how they performed in other states. We compiled it all on a website (www.childcareunioninfo.com), and providers soon learned of the vast divide between union claims and reality. Over the years, weve been contacted by founding members, previous presidents, and officers of child-care unions in other states who are disgruntled that the union they believed held so much promise led nowhere  that it was nothing more than a way for the SEIU to collect millions from the child-care assistance program intended to help low-income families. In Illinois, for example, only a tiny percentage of the providers (paying up to $900 per year in dues and fees) received health insurance. The raises in reimbursement rates the union has negotiated have been minimal; barely keeping up with the rising cost of child care. Six years after unionization, 20,000 fewer children in Illinois were being served by the Child Care and Development Fund program. So who actually benefits from child-care unionization? The SEIU does. Since it began charging dues and fees, the SEIU has taken a staggering $60 million from the child-care providers in Illinois. When Rhode Island Gov. Donald Carcieri vetoed a similar attempt back in 2005, he described this as the Trojan Horse of the effort by organized labor. His predictions were spot on, but its not too late. Child-care providers, the union is at your door, full of promises, but in reality unionization will have disastrous consequences for your businesses and the children and families you serve. Rhode Islands child-care professionals deserve better than empty promises and compulsory dues. They deserve access to all the facts regarding this intrusion into their independent businesses, so they can be prepared to participate in the upcoming election and vote no. Jennifer Parrish operates a child-care business out of her home in Minnesota and has been working against unionization efforts there and across the country."
http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2013/oct/20/evan-feinberg/activist-says-local-police-will-have-access-obamac/,"  IArlington, Va. n preparation for the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration is taking its message to college campuses such as Brown University to sign up as many students as possible. They’ve even brought on board Lady Gaga, Jennifer Hudson, Amy Poehler, and other celebrities to help convince Millennials that the exchanges are cool.

    Apparently they think Millennials are gullible. But no veneer of popularity can mask the exchange system’s deep problems. The simple fact is that they are a bad deal for young people. And as a result, it makes more financial sense for Millennials to opt out of Obama-care rather than join its ranks.

    The most obvious problem with the exchange system is how it perversely relies on a system of generational redistribution. Quite simply, the law takes from the young to subsidize the old. That’s why the White House is so dead-set on getting young people to sign up — without our money, the system won’t work, and the exchanges will enter what has been called a “death spiral.”

    What’s missing in this political calculus is the realization that young people are the least able to afford to purchase healthcare. In an era of sky-high student loan debt (currently over $26,000 per borrower and rising), 16.1 percent unemployment, and stagnating and even falling salaries, Obama-care is estimated to increase insurance premiums for young people by an average of 169 percent.

    Coughing up that much cash isn’t just unaffordable; it’s financial suicide for a debt-ridden generation struggling to find good jobs.

    My generation’s concerns with Obamacare don’t end with the costs. Another sticking point is the law’s “Federal Data Services Hub.” This term is at best a euphemism; the Data Hub is an enormous database of every participant’s private medical records, tax and financial info, legal history, and other intimate information that we probably wouldn’t want out in the open.

    It’s basically an National Security Agency-esque database of TMI — “too much information.”

    And there are way too many hands in this overflowing informational cookie jar. As it stands, local law enforcement, insurance companies, and innumerable federal agencies and low-level bureaucrats will have access to the Data Hub’s treasure trove of personal info.

    Even the law’s “navigators” — employees from non-governmental groups, some of which are politically controversial — will have access to the database’s secrets. It’s an astounding assault on privacy, and it’s no surprise that it’s being challenged in court.

    These problems, along with others, have even caused Congress to exempt itself from the exchange. Similarly, unions, corporations, and others with political connections have received waivers or extensions from the administration. Not everyone has been so lucky.

    Thankfully, Millennials do have one remaining option: Opt out of Obamacare. This path lets them pay a small penalty, which then frees them to purchase health insurance outside of the exchange system. That insurance can be specifically tailored to their individual needs — and it won’t have the drawbacks that make the exchange system so unappealing.

    Young people can actually end up saving a substantial amount of money by taking this road. A recent study by the National Center for Public Policy Research estimates that 3.7 million Americans between ages18 and 34 will save at least $500. A full 3 million will even save as much as $1,000. Opting out of Obamacare is thus an attractive option for Millennials, who tend to be healthy and need a greater share of their paychecks in order to make ends meet.

    Of course, the alternative is for them to join an exchange system that both picks their pockets and shares their secrets. No celebrity is popular enough to gloss over that.

http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2013/oct/30/rhode-island-tea-party/rhode-island-tea-party-says-soldiers-who-donate-te/,"(by TODD STARNES, Fox News Radio) -- Soldiers attending a pre-deployment briefing at Fort Hood say they were told that evangelical Christians and members of the Tea Party were a threat to the nation and that any soldier donating to those groups would be subjected to punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. A soldier who attended the Oct. 17th briefing told me the counter-intelligence agent in charge of the meeting spent nearly a half hour discussing how evangelical Christians and groups like the American Family Association were tearing the country apart. Michael Berry, an attorney with the Liberty Institute, is advising the soldier and has launched an investigation into the incident. The American public should be outraged that the U.S. Army is teaching our troops that evangelical Christians and Tea Party members are enemies of America, and that they can be punished for supporting or participating in those groups, said Berry, a former Marine Corps JAG officer. These statements about evangelicals being domestic enemies are a serious charge. The soldier told me he fears reprisals and asked not to be identified. He said there was a blanket statement that donating to any groups that were considered a threat to the military and government was punishable under military regulations. My first concern was if I was going to be in trouble going to church, the evangelical Christian soldier told me. Can I tithe? Can I donate to Christian charities? What if I donate to a politician who is a part of the Tea Party movement? Another soldier who attended the briefing alerted the Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty. That individuals recollections of the briefing matched the soldier who reached out to me. I was very shocked and couldnt believe what I was hearing, the soldier said. I felt like my religious liberties, that I risk my life and sacrifice time away from family to fight for, were being taken away. And while a large portion of the briefing dealt with the threat evangelicals and the Tea Party pose to the nation, barely a word was said about Islamic extremism, the soldier said. Our community is still healing from the act of terrorism brought on by Nidal Hasan  who really is a terrorist, the soldier said. This is a slap in the face. The military is supposed to defend freedom and to classify the vast majority of the military that claim to be Christian as terrorists is sick. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, tells me the Pentagon is pushing anti-Christian propaganda. On the very base that was the site of mass murder carried out by a radicalized Muslim soldier, it is astonishing that it is evangelical groups that are being identified as a threat, he said. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel must immediately intervene to stop this march against the rights and freedom of our soldiers. The soldier said they were also told that the pro-life movement is another example of radicalization. They said that evangelical Christians protesting abortions are the mobilization stage and that leads to the bombing of abortion clinics, he said, recalling the discussion. An Army spokesman at the Pentagon tells me they do not maintain or publish a list of organizations considered extremist. None of these slides [shown at the briefing] were produced by the Army, but by soldiers who included information found during an Internet search, the spokesman said. He said commanders and other leaders were cautioned that they should not use lists of extremists, hate groups, radical factions or the like compiled by any outside non-governmental groups or organizations for briefings, command presentations, or as a short cut to determining if a group or activity is considered to be extremist. Meanwhile, the public affairs office at Fort Hood is denying the soldiers' allegations. The allegations you are asking about were brought to the attention of the Fort Hood leadership immediately and a (sic) inquiry is occurring, read a statement from Tom Rheinlander, the public affairs director at Fort Hood. At this time, initial information gathered about the training and what you claim occurred is not substantiated by unit leadership and soldiers present at this training venue. I sent the public affairs officer additional questions about the specific content of the briefing but he declined to respond. But this is not the first time an Army briefing has labeled evangelicals as extremists. Last April an Army Reserve briefing classified Evangelical Christianity and Catholicism as religious extremism. In a letter to Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.), Secretary of the Army John McHugh said the briefing in April was an isolated incident and the material used was not sanctioned by the Army. McHugh said it was a misguided attempt to explain that extremism is not limited to a single religion. Two weeks ago, several dozen active duty troops at Camp Shelby in Mississippi, were told the American Family Association, a well-respected Christian ministry, should be classified as a domestic hate group because it advocates for traditional family values. Again, the military called it an isolated incident with a trainer using material that was not sanctioned by the military. That explanation is wearing thin with American Christians. How much longer can the Army claim no knowledge or responsibility for these things? Berry asked. These repeated incidents show either that this training was directed from Army leadership at the Pentagon, or else the Army has a real discipline and leadership problem on its hands because a bunch of rogue soldiers are teaching this nonsense. The most recent allegations at Fort Hood have drawn sharp rebuke from religious liberty groups around the nation. Why is the Army engaged in these anti-Christian training propaganda briefings? asked Perkins, himself a veteran of the Marine Corps. The only explanation is that this is a deliberate effort of the Obama administration to intimidate and separate soldiers from Christian groups that they support and that support them. Ron Crews, executive director of the Chaplain Alliance, called the militarys behavior dishonorable. Far from mere isolated incidents, as the Army has dismissed previous occurrences, this latest incident demonstrates a pattern and practice of Army briefings identifying mainstream religions, such as Evangelical Christianity, Judaism, and Catholicism, as examples of religious extremism similar to Al Qaeda, Hamas and the Ku Klux Klan, he told me. Perkins said its time for the Pentagon to ensure that instructors carry out their role to train our troops to defend our freedom, and not push anti-Christian propaganda.

Ian Priors Jan. 14 Commentary (R.I.s weakening influence in Washington) about the Rhode Island congressional delegations losing its influence in Washington is not only misleading, but also completely inaccurate. It is also a serious omission that The Journal, while identifying Mr. Prior as the Northeast regional press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee, failed to mention that he was also the campaign manager for Brendan Doherty who ran unsuccessfully against David Cicilline in 2012. With that in mind, it is easier for readers to understand Mr. Priors motivations for writing such a column. The notion that all of our problems would be solved by replacing our delegation with a bunch of Republican freshmen is completely absurd. The current Congress, which is controlled by Democrats in the Senate and Republicans in the House, only sent 57 bills to President Obamas desk in 2013, making it the least productive Congress in history  barely beating out the last Congress, which had the same division. The House Republicans failure and inability to govern caused the first government shutdown in 16 years. The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill, extending unemployment benefits, raising the minimum wage, and passing comprehensive immigration reform. Electing more Republicans to Congress wouldnt improve the situation; it would only make it worse. And the idea that four Republican freshmen from Rhode Island would all of a sudden save the day and deliver for our state is absolutely ridiculous. In fact the opposite would happen. Our state would receive less federal funding and we would be at a significant disadvantage compared with other states with more senior representation. Just look how effective the newest batch of Republican members were last year. Only four  thats right, four  Republican freshmen saw their bills become law in 2013. Its also important to remember that the Democrats still control the White House for another two years and currently control the U.S. Senate. Even if the Republicans were to win control of the Senate in November, they would still have to go through a Democratic president to get their legislation signed into law and they wouldnt have enough votes to override a veto. The only body currently controlled by the Republicans is the House of Representatives, and the Republicans saw their majority shrink from 25 seats to 17 seats in the 2012 election. If the Republicans continue to play games with sensitive issues like the debt ceiling and unemployment benefits, the Democratic Party could win back the House this November and maintain control of the Senate.

http://www.politifact.com/tennessee/statements/2012/mar/30/marsha-blackburn/marsha-blackburn-says-patients-power-control-healt/,"Congressman Marsha Blackburn (TN-7) issued the following statement regarding her vote for H.R. 452, the “Medicare Decisions Accountability Act of 2011,” which passed with bipartisan support today in the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health. H.R. 452, sponsored by Representative Phil Roe (TN-1), would repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) that was set up under President Obama’s flawed health care law.
“Our seniors have spent their entire working lives giving the government first right of refusal on their paycheck in order to receive health care coverage when they turn 65. Physicians are already restricting how many Medicare patients they treat. With IPAB, this problem will only get worse – leaving our seniors without the necessary access to physicians they deserve.  

“Instead of giving patients control of their health care decisions, the President and his allies in Congress chose to delegate this power to a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington. Repealing IPAB is another step towards getting the harmful provisions of Obamacare off the books. Health care decisions should be made by patients and their physicians – not bureaucrats.”"

The current administrations solution is to raise taxes, not cut spending. Times are tight for American families, and as they are looking at ways to make their dollars go further, the federal government should look at ways of keeping American dollars a little closer to home. While the United States continues to drown in debt, there was some good news south of the border. According to reports, money sent back to Mexico is on the rise. Recently, the Bank of Mexico reported remittances totaling $1.95 billion in August, up 9.32 percent from the same month last year. Apparently, the U.S. job market isnt tough for everyone. A Mexican-based financial company is forecasting $22 billion in remittances for 2010 making it Mexicos second highest revenue maker behind crude oil. Not all of this comes from the 20 million illegal workers. There are people that have come to our country legally to work, but they also send much of their income south of the border. These remittances are an economic drain on America, but Mexico would collapse without them. Not only are we not recirculating billions of U.S. dollars earned in our country back into our own economy, we are also dolling out taxpayer-funded social services to millions who dont contribute to the system. The open-borders crowd continues to insist that those working here illegally contribute more to our economy than the benefits they illegally receive, but $22 billion dollars taken out of our economy says otherwise. Its not just the money being sent home, its also the costs incurred here. The Federation for American Immigration Reform has estimated that the total cost of education for illegals is $52 billion a year. The report says Texas is saddled with $16.4 billion of that amount. However, it is important to point out that this cost includes American-born children of people living here illegally. It is argued that we cant count these children because under current policy, they are considered U.S. citizens, even though their parents are not and even though many of their mothers illegally came to the U.S. for the sole purpose of having a child. While I am not so sure the correct interpretation of the 14th Amendment makes these children automatic citizens, the Supreme Court has not issued a ruling on the issue of birthright citizenship. The Harris County Hospital District, the public hospital system in Houston, Texas, found that 60 percent of births over the last four years were by women living here illegally. Its estimated, in Texas alone, there are 1.5 million illegal immigrants, to which 60,000 babies are born to their households annually. In fact, a Pew Hispanic Center study revealed that 8 percent of U.S. babies a year are born to mothers here illegally. At a hearing before the Texas House State Affairs Committee, the director of research for the Health and Human Services Commission, told the committee that healthcare to illegal immigrants last year cost the state of Texas nearly $100 million, with the bulk being emergency room care. According to the budget director for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 7.5 percent of the total prison population claimed foreign residency costing the state $171 million a year. However, the real costs are unknown as these figures are based only on the identified illegals in the prison system. This doesnt even account for the costs incurred by the victims of these crimes either. As we begin to hear talk about the DREAM Act that will subsidize education costs and grant amnesty to people 35 years old or younger who illegally entered the United States before they were 16 years of age, the costs of this not so dreamy plan are conveniently brushed under the rug. Illegals get to go to any school without having to pay out-of-state tuition. This only applies to law breakers. Why would Congress pass a law that discriminates against Americans and lawful immigrants to the benefit of those who break our laws? There is more. Say you cant afford the tuition. Under this amnesty plan, people living here illegally are eligible for federal student loans at the expense of American citizens. Why should people living here illegally be given an advantage to obtain loans that should go to citizens and possibly legal immigrants? This policy will deplete the already strained resources for college expense by adding millions of people to the system. After you complete two years of post high school education or two years of military service you are eligible for citizenship. Once a citizen, this paves the way to bring the rest of their extended family to the United States. I agree that something must be done, but the American people have rejected amnesty in every form that it has been presented. The costs of this bill will be footed by the American taxpayer for years to come. I understand that everyone wants to come to our country; I dont blame them. But, we cannot afford to continue to turn a blind eye to the economic drain illegal entry places on every aspect of our society. We cannot treat people here illegally better than we treat our own citizens and legal residents. Do the math: illegal immigration is breaking the bank  the American bank that is.

Terry was killed. 

 

Chairman Elect Smith:  “In the last five years, 28,000 people have been killed along the U.S.-Mexico border, including 1,000 law enforcement officers.  The murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry is a sad reminder of the real-life dangers that Americans and our law enforcement agents face along the southwest border.  The Obama administration’s lax enforcement of immigration laws, coupled with calls for mass amnesty, only encourage more illegal immigration.  Our border remains porous and the Obama administration has done nothing to stop the steady flow of human and drug smuggling from Mexico.   

 

“What will it take to make the Obama administration realize that we must do more to secure our border and keep Americans safe? Earlier this year, a rancher in Arizona was killed on his own property.  The suspect is believed to have been an illegal immigrant.  Last night, Border Patrol Agent Terry lost his life for simply doing his job.  How many more Americans will die before the Obama administration wakes up and starts taking illegal immigration seriously?”"

Late last week, Bennett made waves by declaring, among other things, that the Tea Party will allow Harry Reid to save his Nevada Senate seat. Cornyn responded yesterday by speculating that Bennetts recent defeat at the Utah Republican convention. I disagree with that, Cornyn told TPMDC. I respect Sen. Bennett a lot. Hes been through a tough experience because of the unusual selection process in his state and that may have had some impact on his views.This is going to be a referendum on the Obama administration and Harry Reids performance in office, Cornyn added. I realize were hot and heavy leading up to the election, but the voters are going to make the right decision. There have been 30 published polls in this election cycle and Harry Reids been trailing in every single one of them. Bennett couldnt disagree more. With the tea party creating the mischief that it is in Colorado, we may not win that seat. My sources in Nevada say with Sharron Angle theres no way Harry Reid loses in Nevada, he told the AP Friday. Rand Paul  thats a seat we could lose in Kentucky, but McConnell seems to be helping stabilize Rand Paul and pulling back from some of his more dangerous statements.

It's like the lyrics of Workin' Man by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band: Had me a job till the market fell out Tried hard to borrow but there was no help. Now I've got nowhere to go. I need a job for these two hands I'm a workin' man With nowhere to go And if our Republican colleagues continue to blame unemployment on the unemployed, there will be about another 5 million Americans with nowhere to go -- lacking the means to put food on the table next year when their unemployment insurance expires. While Republicans continue their fact-less finger-pointing, I think it is long past time we set the story straight. Fact: An unemployment check is not a substitute for a paycheck. Unemployment benefits usually amount to only a fraction of what a worker was making before losing his or her job. Fact: Unless you are actively searching for a job, getting job training for a new job, or are on a temporary layoff, you are not entitled to an unemployment check. There is little evidence to support Republican claims that unemployment insurance benefits are a significant factor in discouraging folks from going out and looking for work. Fact: To receive extended benefits, an unemployed person is required to accept reasonable offers of employment. Two out of three unemployed respondents in the Heldrich Center survey, and 80 percent of those who received benefits, said they would be willing to take a pay cut to get a new job. Fact: One economist estimates that for every $1 we spent on unemployment insurance benefits, we get $1.61 in economic activity back. Some estimates, like that from a Department of Labor study originally commissioned during the Bush Administration appears to find an even greater economic impact. We must create jobs, but we must also preserve a vital lifeline for folks who are looking for work. The facts are clear -- the time to extend unemployment coverage is now."
http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/feb/21/dan-flynn/state-rep-dan-flynn-says-texas-students-spend-no-t/,"We have received many calls from the district quite concerned over the ongoing situation at Mansfield ISD.  We have learned that as part of the five-year $1.3 Million grant, Arabic classes would be mandatory at Cross Timbers Intermediate School and Kenneth Davis Elementary School. The program would also be optional for students at T. A. Howard Middle School and Summit High School.  This has caused consternation within our district as many concerned parents do not want this type of situation to occur in their children's classrooms and quite frankly I agree with them whole heartedly.  The Superintendent has publicly stated the program has been placed on hold but that is really not the point.

Parents at Cross Timbers say they were caught off-guard by the program, and were surprised the district only told them about it in a meeting Monday night between parents and Mansfield ISD Superintendent Bob Morrison.  This type of 'surprise' is not something that parents need or want and I agree with my constituents that the parents should have been involved from a point any grant was applied for or received.  You have to wonder why are we just now finding out about it. 

Apparently, the background on this grant is that the Department of Education has identified Arabic as a ‘language of the future'.  I have to wonder what the reason for this selection was and who was responsible for this selection.  More importantly, why does the Federal Government think they need to spend our tax dollars on this program when the government is running trillions of dollars in debt.  Many have contended that this  is an attempt by the federal government to 'sensitize' our children to this culture and without information to the contrary I may have to agree with them.   

I also have to wonder that at a time when our children do not spend any time in school learning about our own US Constitution how can this be a priority?  Is it because the Federal Department of Education thinks it knows best what our children need to learn?  Is it part of the culture where others think they know more about what our kids should learn rather than to respect the parent's wishes?  This is simply an attitude that cannot be allowed to flourish. 

Mansfield ISD says in addition to language, the grant provides culture, government, art, traditions and history as part of the curriculum and that really is the only 'mandatory' part.  This seems to make no sense at all and may be a deflection from the truth.  However one point is clear and is worth repeating:  the 'culture' of the Arab world is inseparable from the religious component because it does not respect secular government and never has.  Their own history books and statements make that perfectly clear.  So, if schools want to teach Islam as a 'culture' then I want my constituents to be able to teach Christianity as a culture since the United States is founded on Judeo-Christian principles .  At least that would be fair, but since that may not happen it seems clear that we need to stay away from being politically correct and start being morally correct and concentrate on the religious, historic and moral principles the founding fathers of our country fought so hard to establish.

http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/feb/27/leo-berman/state-rep-leo-berman-says-hawaii-governor-cant-fin/,"Lawmakers in at least 10 states have introduced bills relating to the 'birther' movement. Birther debate alive across U.S. The opening of 2011 state legislative sessions has been accompanied by a spate of birther-related bills, the clearest indication yet that the controversy surrounding President Barack Obamas place of birth will continue to simmer throughout his reelection campaign. Lawmakers in at least 10 states have introduced bills requiring presidential candidates to provide some form of proof that they are natural-born citizens, a ballot qualification rule designed to address widespread rumors on the right that Obama was not born in the United States. Story Continued Below The notion that Obama does not meet constitutional qualifications to be president has dogged him since the early stages of the 2008 race, despite his campaigns posting online his certificate of live birth in the state of Hawaii. The birther controversy resurfaced in recent weeks when newly elected Hawaii Democratic Gov. Neil Abercrombie, a friend of Obamas parents, promised to investigate the issue and finally put to rest rumors that he was born in Kenya or Indonesia. Abercrombie later backtracked, citing the states privacy laws. So far, the conservative conspiracy theorists who have pushed national media campaigns and numerous legal challenges questioning the presidents eligibility have met little success. At the state level, however, the issue continues to fester. This years bills, if passed, would create a requirement for presidential campaigns to prove candidates place of birth, a proviso that sponsors say would finally clear up the matter. Election law attorneys say that if the bills are passed, states may be able to kick presidential candidates off the ballot for not complying  though a legal challenge would be very likely. The Constitution gives state legislatures plenary power to set the rules for choosing presidential electors. A state legislature, in theory, as Bush v. Gore acknowledges, could even take away the popular vote for the president and decide on the choice itself, said Rick Hasen, a law professor and author of the respected Election Law blog. Cleta Mitchell, a conservative election lawyer, made similar comments, arguing that states have had latitude historically to require filing fees, signatures on petitions and other ministerial procedures  and providing a birth certificate verifying a persons constitutional qualifications of age and citizenship seems perfectly reasonable. The bills vary in terms of how election officials would sign off on the ballot eligibility of presidential candidates, a process that would be triggered by a presidential campaigns application to get on the primary ballot. Some measures, such as one in Connecticut, would require the secretary of state to view the original birth certificate, while others would require an affidavit providing documentation of a candidates name and place of birth. We dont think the president was vetted, and its just that simple, Texas GOP state Rep. Leo Berman said, adding that he doesnt know whether Obama is a citizen or not but that he believes the question has not been fully examined. I read different things that say he was born in Hawaii, and then I read the governor cant find anything that says he was born in Hawaii, Berman added. Why the president wont show a birth certificate is beyond me. Berman said that hes received the foulest e-mails I have ever seen in my life since introducing the bill, but contended he has a significant amount of support  if not yet a large number of co-sponsors  within the Texas Legislature. My colleagues love it, he said, adding that his bill will pass overwhelmingly in the House. But Berman predicted that Democrats in the state Senate would block the bill from getting the two-thirds majority it needs to pass."
http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/feb/28/chuck-norris/chuck-norris-says-school-districts-and-federal-gov/,"Former first lady Barbara Bush said on Greta Van Susterens On the Record last week: Weve got a real problem in public schools.  This is a national crisis. It is as bad as anything in our country. When Greta was pointing out from Barbaras own op-ed piece that, Texas [is] 36th in the nation [on] high school graduates. And 3.8 million Texans dont have a high school diploma, Mrs. Bush said, No more, youre killing us. Mrs. Bush was commendably protecting Texas pride as she called Greta not to cite any further degrading statistics about the state of Lone Star education, though she herself references it in her op-ed piece: Texas ranks 49th in verbal SAT Scores, 47th in literacy and 46th in average math SAT scores. Texas ranks 33rd in the nation on teacher salaries. Such low verbal and literacy scores makes it even more unbelievable that, just this past week, some of our states educational administrators joined the feds in seeking to mandate Arabic classes for Texas children. No joke! The Arabic studies program, funded by a five-year, $1.3 million Foreign Language Assistance Program federal grant, was to begin this semester at Cross Timbers Intermediate School in Mansfield School District, then spread to neighboring Davis Elementary and Howard Middle schools in the fall and to Summit High School by fall 2012. Thank God for the parental passions and patriot fires of almost 200 parents who showed up at a school meeting last Monday night to question the wisdom of officials at Cross Timbers Intermediate School. Good for them! They are fighting in their own personal education Alamo and presently have the upper hand. For the moment, the Mansfield school district has backed off plans for its Arabic studies program. With 14 percent of adult U.S. Americans (one in seven, or 32 million) being illiterate, those incapable of reading a newspaper or instructions on a prescription bottle, dont you think federal monies could be put to better use, like by helping Americans to read and write English? I so appreciate Barbara Bushs non-politically correct stance on the primacy of English in America, as she echoed to Greta: Im against English as a second language. My great-grandmother came as a German. She didnt have someone teach her English as a second language. She learned it in three months. It is survival. You see it in schools all around now where you are allowed to speak English only. And you sink or swim. They swim, because they are immigrants from all different countries. Ive seen a school in Boston [where] they asked me to read. I said read? They all speak 80 different languages. In three months they learned English. As with Mrs. Bush, too, Im an optimist and believe, with a lot of hard work and all of us involved, we can reform public education. And by we I mean we the people, not our governments. As even the title of the great movie and critique on the U.S. public education system, Waiting for Superman, alludes, it is you and I who are left to be the heroes to our posterity. It is people like the 200 parents who are helping to overturn that Texas Mansfield Independent School Districts decision to mandate classes on Arabic who are showing the way. They prove another point Barbara Bush made to Greta last week: I dont think government can do everything at all. Parents, grandparents, neighbors, churches, everybody  weve got to get ourselves geared up and not be lazy parents and not be lazy neighbors, but weve got to help children.  What Mrs. Bush and I (and others in this educational reform movement) are essentially calling all of us to do is fight in a local education Alamo! Square off and fight against all the negative forces that besiege our children and impede their proper education. You dont have to have kids to engage in this culture war; you only have to be concerned about their future Americas future. But let there be no doubt: Theres a particular rallying call to those parents who are sitting on the sidelines. Again, as Mrs. Bush further states in her op-ed piece, Some parents forget they are their childrens first teachers, and the home is the first school. When our kids come home from school, do they read a book, or do they sit glued to the television or the Internet? Do they see us reading? Do we eat together, or does everybody grab a bite and dash out the door? Do we talk and listen? Do we help with homework? Are we active in the PTA? Do we make sure we attend all parent-teacher conferences, or do we use work as an excuse to skip out occasionally? Its easier to be a lazy parent than a good parent, but with parenthood comes responsibility and accountability. The only way to get America and its educational system back on track is to take back the primary role of parenting from teachers and other societal guardians (including Big Brother government). That also includes not expecting those who lead our Sunday schools to be the primary spiritual teachers of our children, rather owning that area of their maturation as well. What U.S. educational reform entails is that we all find a place in the battle. It might mean that you join an influential group that makes decisions in your local schools, or pressures those who do. Or it might mean that you participate, volunteer or give feedback to those powers who run your childrens classrooms  or that you become a leader, or influence those who are, who make curriculum decisions. What Im saying is, be proactive. Dont wait for first lady Michelle Obama to correct your childrens school diet before you do something about it. Ensure that civic organizations in your area, including tea parties and churches, are activists in your public schools. Call parishioners out of the pews and into school community outreach. Fighting for the next generation is why Gena and my life mission is to take physical education up a notch in Texas public schools by offering our KickStartKids program. It is also why for years we have also supported Barbara Bushs Foundation for Family Literacy, and encourage you to do the same by going to her official website. It all comes down to one question every citizen in our country must answer: are you spectating or fighting for Americas children in your local education Alamo? (For more ideas, please go to the action items on the official Waiting on Superman website to see what you can do to join the educational reformation across the country and in your local community.

Hes also currently refusing $830 million in federal aid to education because the Democratic members of Congress from Texas  ticked off because Perry used $3.2 billion in stimulus dollars for schools to plug other holes in his budget  put in special language requiring that this time Texas actually use the money for the kids. If I have to cast very tough votes, criticized by every Republican as too much federal spending, at least it ought to go to the purpose we voted for it, said Doggett. Nobody wants to see underperforming, overcrowded schools being deprived of more resources anywhere. But when it happens in Texas, its a national crisis. The birth rate there is the highest in the country, and if it continues that way, Texas will be educating about a tenth of the future population. It ranks third in teen pregnancies  always the children most likely to be in need of extra help. And it is No. 1 in repeat teen pregnancies. Photo Which brings us to choice two. Besides reducing services to children, Texas is doing as little as possible to help women  especially young women  avoid unwanted pregnancy . For one thing, its extremely tough for teenagers to get contraceptives in Texas. If you are a kid, even in college, if its state-funded you have to have parental consent, said Susan Tortolero, director of the Prevention Research Center at the University of Texas in Houston . Plus, the Perry government is a huge fan of the deeply ineffective abstinence-only sex education. Texas gobbles up more federal funds than any other state for the purpose of teaching kids that the only way to avoid unwanted pregnancies is to avoid sex entirely. (Who knew that the health care reform bill included $250 million for abstinence-only sex ed? Thank you, Senator Orrin Hatch !)

Can you give me a statistic suggesting it works? asked Smith. Im just going to tell you from my own personal life. Abstinence works, said Perry, doggedly. Tortolero, who lectures around the country on effective ways to prevent teenage pregnancy, once testified before a committee in the Texas House that was considering a bill to require that sex education classes only provide information that was medically accurate. The bill was controversial. Ill let you ponder that for a minute. Tortolero said she got some support from a legislator who was also a pediatrician. We talked back and forth for a month. But some groups in Texas were threatening him and he was a very junior member, she recalled. The bill died. Meanwhile, Perry  having chosen not to help young women avoid unwanted pregnancies and not to pay enough to educate the booming population of Texas children  wowed the crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington with his states rights rhetoric. Which would be fine, as I said, if his state wasnt in charge of preparing a large chunk of the nations future work force. Perry used to be famous for his flirtation with talk of secession. Maybe we should encourage him to revisit it."

See the full map here. Pop some corn, ladies and gentlemen, because today Dr. Donna Campbell made it official  she is going to primary State Senator Jeff Wentworth for SD 25. SD 25 includes a chunk of of South Austin, plus all or part of Hays, Kendall, Comal, Bexar and Guadalupe Counties. It is pretty hard-core Republican territory. Y'all should remember Dr. Donna from 2010, when she ran a spirited race against Lloyd Doggett, and lost. She's a Tea Party zealot and extreme right winger, so it will be interesting to see how she does in a 2012 primary with Rick Perry also on the ballot. (She won a GOP primary in 2010, besting George Morovich 70%-30%.) This should be interesting. Dr. Donna is viewed by many as being actually insane. Wentworth raised more than a few eyebrows last session with his relentless determination to pass his Guns in Campus Buildings bill, even trying to prevent Senator Wendy Davis from attending her own kid's high school graduation in Fort Worth, threatening to bring the bill up for a vote while she was away. Expect escalating rhetoric around abortion. Wentworth has always been moderate on the issue  he even voted against the Sonogram bill this last session, providing one of the best lines of the debate when he said I personally am a hairy-legged male who will never be pregnant. True. Meanwhile, Dr. Donna thinks abortion runs counter to her medical training. She wrote on her former Congressional campaign website, There is perhaps no issue closer to my heart than protecting the sanctity of life. The lost lives that result from abortions are lost hopes, our lost moments with future family members, and the lost dreams of an entire generation. In founding America, we made a promise to protect Life, liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. In keeping that promise, we are called by a higher power to speak up for those who cannot defend themselves. Fear not  if elected, Dr. Donna will do absolutely nothing to provide for the pursuit of education, health care, or quality of life of these forced births. Also, those who cannot defend themselves will most assuredly mean only the unborn Texans, not the millions of people victimized by Rick Perry and the Republican legislature this last session. By the by, she also had an Issues page on God. Wentworth's probably going to have a difficult time explaining the abortion issue away  if there's one thing Republican primary voters hate more than LGBT rights or minorities, it's women's reproductive rights! Also interesting to see is if Campbell's army of Tea Party activists who came to help in 2010 from around the country will return this cycle. They were pretty creepy, canvassing every house in South Austin in red shirts and camoflage pants, as I recall. At least by blanket-canvassing precincts with >60% DPI they saved TCDP and the Doggett campaign some work. Should be an interesting race. Wentworth has served in the Senate since 1993, and in the Texas House from 1988-1993. He already announced that he's running again. Wentworth tried to get a cushy university administrative gig, but it didn't pan out. (I guess he's no Brian McCall or John Sharp.) It would not have surprised me if he had retired after this past session; apparently Dr. Donna is going to try and do the honors for him. Dr. Donna, by the way, does not currently live in the district (she lives in Hagar's district), but is apparently planning to move to Hays County. She's originally from Oklahoma. She wants to make America exceptional again. Strategic upside: since she ran for CD-25 last cycle, and is running for SD-25 now, all of her old campaign merch with 25 on it can be repurposed. (I am guessing she's opposed to recycling, but arguably she should be in favor of saving money, right?) In any case, this primary is likely to be pretty brutal. There's a chance the candidates will run so far to the right, they may actually fall off the edge of the 6000-year-old flat earth Donna Campbell thinks she occupies. Good times!"

It asks the Obama administration to peacefully grant the withdrawal of Texas, and describes doing so as practically feasible, given the states large economy. Residents in other states, including Alabama, Florida, Colorado, Louisiana and Oklahoma, have submitted similar petitions, though none have received as many signatures as the one from Texas. A White House official said every petition that crossed the signature threshold would be reviewed and would receive a response, though it was unclear precisely when Micah H. would receive his answer.

Governor Perry believes in the greatness of our union, and nothing should be done to change it, a spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said in a statement. But he also shares the frustrations many Americans have with our federal government. The secession movement in Texas is divergent, with differences in goals and tactics. One group, the Republic of Texas, says that secession is unnecessary because, it claims, Texas is an independent nation that was illegally annexed by the United States in 1845. (The groups leader and other followers waged a weeklong standoff with the Texas Rangers in 1997 that left one of its members dead.) Mr. Kilgore, the candidate who is changing his middle name, said he had not signed the White House petition because he did not believe that Texans needed to ask Washington for permission to leave. Our economy is about 30 percent larger than that of Australia, said Mr. Kilgore, 48, a telecommunications contractor. Australia can survive on their own, and I dont think well have any problem at all surviving on our own in Texas. Few of the public calls for secession have addressed the messy details, like what would happen to the states many federal courthouses, prisons, military bases and parklands. No one has said what would become of Kevin Patteson, the director of the states Office of State-Federal Relations, and no one has asked the Texas residents who received tens of millions of dollars in federal aid after destructive wildfires last year for their thoughts on the subject. But all the secession talk has intrigued liberals as well. Caleb M. of Austin started his own petition on the White House Web site. He asked the federal government to allow Austin to withdraw from Texas and remain part of the United States, in the event that Texas is successful in the current bid to secede. It had more than 8,000 signatures as of Friday."

http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/aug/02/lone-star-project/democratic-group-says-abbott-misspent-1-million-pl/,"In announcing his run for Texas Governor today, Greg Abbott used hopeful rhetoric in an attempt to mask a hostile and self-serving record. As a career politician, Abbott has used public office and the hard-earned money of Texas taxpayers to advance himself within the Republican Party and to undermine the hopes of Texas families and their hard work for a better future.
Abbott’s shallow but partisan rhetoric is exactly the same political recipe Rick Perry has been serving for over a dozen years. Like Perry, Greg Abbott sees public service as an opportunity for personal advancement. His record is a series of self-serving actions that have held Texans back rather than move us forward. Texans don’t want or need a fifth term for Rick Perry, yet that is what a Greg Abbott governorship would be.

A career politician dependent upon public office
Greg Abbott has spent most of his adult life either running for office or serving in office, all while milking the state payroll. Abbott is part of a group of political lifers who have drawn a state paycheck for a combined 114 years. He worked in private practice as a lawyer for barely 10 years. Abbott’s first two political offices were not the result of him winning an election but rather as appointments to fill a vacancy. Greg Abbott been living off of Texas taxpayers and political contributors for almost every one of the last 20 years.

Working against Texans rather than for them
Time and again as State Attorney General, Abbott has ignored real problems that threaten Texas families and instead used the resources of the AG’s office to go after perceived political enemies or to advance himself. Just a few years ago, Abbott converted over $1 million in federal grant money intended for use in prosecuting online sexual predators and other cyber crimes and instead used it to harass and prosecute senior citizens who were assisting other senior citizens in applying for mail-in ballots.

Partisanship matched by incompetence
Texans’ privacy and personal finances were threatened when the AG’s office exposed hundreds of thousands of Social Security numbers while releasing other documents during voter photo ID litigation. Abbott’s incompetence did not result in a wider release of private information ONLY because opposing council in the case identified and notified Abbott of his error.

Partisan like Perry, but more bitter and mean-spirited
Like Perry, Abbott sees the world as red versus blue and uses his official office to punish enemies while advancing himself and his partisan allies. Abbott has taken his partisanship even further to what can only be described as heartlessness. As part of a sham investigation into voter fraud, Abbott sent agents from the AG’s office to harass an elderly Democratic activist in Fort Worth. The agents went to the elderly woman’s home and, when she did not immediately come to the door, they circled the house and peeped in her windows. The woman was startled to see one of Abbott’s agents staring at her through the bathroom window as she stepped out of the shower. Rather than apologize, the agents insisted on interrogating the woman, then left without fully explaining their reasons for coming to her home. Greg Abbott has yet to explain his actions, much less apologize for them."

British Airways announced today that it will begin offering transatlantic Boeing 787 flights five days a week, beginning March 2014. The company says it plans to offer daily flights later in the year. You can read more from British Airways. Original post (Feb. 6): After his State of the City address Tuesday, Mayor Lee Leffingwell pointed to one thing he thinks would help take Austins economic growth to the next level: Nonstop flights to Europe. One of the people trying to make that happen is local lawyer Pete Winstead. He says Austin is the largest city in the U.S. without direct flights to Europe. If you have to fly and change planes and go to DFW and go through a thunderstorm and/or miss your flight because you got delayed out of Austin, time is money for corporate executives, Winstead said. Nonstop air service, even if it leaves Austin 30 minutes late, is not a big problem. Cities such as Pittsburgh have secured government subsidies for airlines to run direct flights to Europe. Winstead says Austin is taking a different approach, one used in San Diego with Japan Airlines. Hes trying to broker a deal between large local companies with big travel budgets and an airline carrier. The company would agree to buy plane tickets from the carrier, and the carrier would fly directly from Austin to Europe. Winstead says British Airways has so far been the most receptive. But Mike Boyd with the aviation consulting firm Boyd Group International is skeptical. To get nonstop service to any one spot in Europe is going to very difficult, because its going to be a European carrier, Boyd said. And its going to have to be a carrier that has a very large hub. And youre probably going to have to pony up a lot of money to get them interested. But if they know they can make a profit on it, theyll do it. Winsted says the negotiations hit a few snags, not least of which was the recent grounding of Boeings Dreamliner 787 because of electrical problems. But he is confident that we could start hearing about nonstop flights from Austin to at least one European city by the end of the year."

But the man who testified before Congress Thursday to become our nations next secretary of Defense sounded very different from the one who, for the past two decades, has advocated that the U.S. adopt a weakened posture on the world stage. Story Continued Below As a two-term senator and active participant in foreign policy discussions, Hagel repeatedly declined to support measures to crack down on state sponsors of terrorism, belittled the notion of using any means to prevent a nuclear Iran, advised U.S. leaders to engage in direct negotiations with rogue nations and hostile terrorist groups, and expressed remarkable antagonism towards the longstanding U.S. alliance with Israel. Since Hagel has been nominated to become Defense secretary, however, hes disavowed each one of these positions. It all amounts to quite the confirmation day conversion. Some of my Senate colleagues may be satisfied that the pledges he has made in recent days are more meaningful than his policy record compiled over the past fifteen years. I am not. Of course, anyone can change their mind on one particular issue; reasonable people do so all the time. However, when a nominee tries to disavow his past positions on virtually every foreign policy issue, all at the same time, it raises serious questions. There is a reason the Washington Post described Hagels views as placing him near the fringe of the Senate. On Iran, Hagel voted against economic sanctions in 2001, 2007, and 2008. Today, he says he supports sanctions. In 2007, Hagel voted against designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard  which was then actively providing explosively formed projectiles to kill U.S. servicemen in Iraq  as a terrorist group. Today, he agrees that they are terrorists. In 2006, he said, a military strike against Iran, a military option, is not a viable, feasible, responsible option. Likewise, in 2010, Hagel told the Atlantic Council that he was not so sure it is necessary to continue to say all options are on the table regarding Irans nuclear program. Today, he says all options (including military force) should be on the table. This article tagged under: Chuck Hagel"

http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/may/01/jack-ohman/california-editorial-cartoonist-says-state-texas-l/,"Several readers wrote me this morning expressing varying levels of concern about the cartoon depicting Gov. Rick Perry's marketing of Texas' loose regulations, juxtaposed with the explosion of the fertilizer plant in West, Texas.

Their comments ranged from ""you are a sick human being"" to ""insensitive and tasteless."" I'm not sure I am clinically qualified to give myself a direct diagnosis, but I am pretty sure I am not a sick human being. Let's explore the question of tastelessness.

The Texas chemical plant had not been inspected by the State of Texas since 2006. That's seven years ago. You may have read in the news that Gov. Perry, during from his business recruiting trips to California and Illinois, generally described his state as free from high taxes and burdensome regulation. One of the burdensome regulations he neglected to mention was the fact that his state hadn't really gotten around to checking out that fertilizer plant. Many Texas cities have little or no zoning, resulting in homes being permitted next to sparely inspected businesse that store explosive chemicals.

So when the plant exploded and killed 14 people, people started asking the inevitable questions about whether this tragedy could have been prevented.

Well, we're not going to know that now, exactly, but I doubt that more inspections and better zoning would have hurt.

Gov. Perry's name and the explosion have been linked for several news cycles. I didn't just make this all up. It's out there. There is a rather stunning report about all this on ProPublica, the investigative news website. I invite you to read it.

When I have to come up with these ideas, I can assure you that I am not really deliberately trying to be tasteless. I am not. What I am trying to do is make readers think about an issue in a striking way. I seem to have succeeded in this cartoon, one way or the other.

The question is whether it is tasteless or not.

My answer, respectfully, is that it isn't.

Having said that, what normal person doesn't mourn those poor people fighting the fire and living by the plant? I certainly do. What makes me angry, and, yes, I am driven by anger, is that it could have been prevented. I guess I could have done a toned-down version of the cartoon; I am not sure what that it would have been, but I think many reader's objections just stemmed from the fact that I used the explosion as a metaphor, period. The wound is fresh, the hurt still stings.

The Texas governor's campaigning notwithstanding, should I have used the explosion as a vehicle to illustrate my point? I did. I stand by it. Here's why: many readers said things along the lines of, ""would you have portrayed the severed limbs created by the Boston bomber to make a political point?"" Hmm. No. I would not. But I have drawn a faceless Iraq war veteran, wrapped in bandages, wanting to know who had to invade Iraq to save face.

Yes, I got the same kind of reaction.

""Tasteless.""

But you know something? I would draw that cartoon again. Wouldn't even think twice about it.

I also drew all the faces of the Newtown massacre children as the new face of the NRA.

""Tasteless.""

Same thing. I would draw it again.

The cartoon we're discussing is rather sanitized, honestly. It shows an explosion. It plays off the word ""Boom/booming."" That's obviously the problem. Would I do it again? Don't know. I knew it was close to the edge, but I went with it, and I don't go with things I can't defend. I'm defending this one because I think that when you have a politician traveling across the country selling a state with low regulatory capacity, that politician also has to be accountable for what happens what that lack of regulation proves to be fatal.

That's exponentially more offensive to me. 

My job, as I understand it, is to be provocative. I provoke, you decide. I don't dictate, I put out my opinion along with everyone's else's. I sign my name. I own it. In my opinion, I could have gone farther. Much farther. 

Does this cartoon disrespect the victims? Their families?

Well, if someone, say a Texas regulator, had picked this up before 2013 but after 2006, maybe I wouldn't have had to draw that cartoon. No victims, no grieving families. So my rather pointed view of all this would be moot.

Gambling with the lives of innocent people is much more offensive to me.

That's way worse than tasteless.

It's reckless."
http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/may/21/leticia-van-de-putte/leticia-van-de-putte-says-algebra-ii-required-texa/,"Gov. Rick Perry today applauded both the Texas Tech University System and University of Houston System for approving a four-year fixed tuition rate for incoming freshmen:

""As families gather around their kitchen tables working to budget and make college a reality, the leadership at Texas Tech University System and University of Houston System have now given them the peace of mind of knowing that tuition will remain the same for four years and at the same time encouraging these students to complete their degrees on time.""

In order to ensure Texas students who want to pursue a degree have access to an affordable education, Gov. Perry has called for a four-year fixed tuition at the rate a student pays his or her freshman year. The University of Texas System, Texas State University System and the University of North Texas System have already announced plans to offer a four-year fixed tuition option.

Gov. Perry has also proposed outcomes-based funding for institutions, tying 10 percent of an institution's state funding to the number of students it graduates. He has also encouraged institutions to use technology to help improve four-year graduation rates and make tuition more affordable. Additionally, the governor has renewed his challenge for institutions to offer bachelor's degrees for $10,000 or less, including books. So far, 13 institutions have announced or implemented a $10,000 degree."
http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/oct/30/daniel-llanes/austins-78702-has-gentrified-its-not-no-2-gentrifi/,"Proposed changes in the city zoning ordinance would allow the slaughter of chickens, rabbits and other animals in all residential neighborhoods. So, it is logical to ask Would an attempt to transform single-family homes into farms with the slaughtering of animals in neighborhoods such as Tarrytown or Pemberton Heights bring on a court action? As adopted by the Planning Commission, the proposed Urban Farm Ordinance would allow the commercialization of single-family zoned land. In essence, the ordinance would blanket zone all single family property in East Austin, and the rest of the city, for commercial use. That change would transform single-family propertys use to Commercial Service Mix Use zoning Even though is would be a citywide ordinance, it would most adversely impact East Austin, where the urban farms seeking the change are now located. Not only would the slaughter of chickens, rabbits and other animals be allowed if the council adopts the proposed changes, the remains could be composted on any single-family zoned property in residential areas. This issue started when a property owner, HausBar Farm, on two single-family lots, was found to be operating a commercial enterprise. For several years, without permits, they kept expanding their operation and creating a health hazard in a single-family residential neighborhood, and it has now caught up to them. They kept expanding their commercial activity, which has become untenable for the neighborhood. Quite simply, HausBar Farms has outgrown their footprint in that location, and if they want to expand, they need to relocate to commercial zoning, like any other business that has outgrown its location. As for the other farms, as the status of the farms underwent further investigation, it turns out that, particularly Springdale Farm, is now engaged in other activities such as weddings, parties, book-signings, etc. All this without permits for parking and zoning requirements, further expanding commercialization. By this increased activity they have further self-identified themselves as commercial operations, and they should now be regulated as such, on commercial property. The farms move toward commercialization of single-family zoning goes against what this neighborhood has fought so hard to create, in what the city, and the nation, now recognize as a premium downtown neighborhood. The farms moved into what was once the edge of town, the other side of the tracts where the City of Austin had, by a racist ordinance, forced the Latino and African-American communities to relocate (1928) along with all unwanted industry. In 2000, during the creation of our Neighborhood Plan, more than 600 properties were rezoned from industrial and commercial to residential. This transformed this neighborhood, and today it is a downtown neighborhood considered to be one of the most desirable in the nation. These neighborhoods, and the people of color in them, have made lemonade out of the lemon despite a historic racism that has endured for almost 90 years. The result is that 78702 is the second-most gentrified zip code in the entire country. To complicate the issue, the reaction by farm advocates, and the unresponsiveness to neighborhood concerns by the Sustainable Food Policy Board over commercial slaughtering in an area zoned for single-family housing, and their failure to include protections for the neighbors, has turned this into a gentrification issue. At this point, this is no different than the first writings of the SXSW amplified sound and the East Studio tour cases. All three were written in isolation, by self-interested groups, without considering existing ordinances, neighborhood plans, etc. As the activity increased, eventually, in each case, they ran up against code compliance and were discovered to be in violation. All three, by process, became adverse gentrification elements. In the SXSW and East Studio Tours issues, the neighborhoods forced the city to revisit each ordinance. In each case, language was rewritten to include neighborhood protections. We came together and worked it out. These three ordinances illustrate the need for the city to identify and address policies and ordinances that disproportionately impact communities of color and low-income populations. The city  all of us who live in it  must insure that policies mitigate and minimize the adverse effects of gentrification. The implications of allowing commercialization of single family zoning, and permitting slaughterhouses in residential areas is unhealthy and unethical. All stakeholders must be considered and more work needs to be done to create ordinances that take all of us forward into a real progressive future instead of taking us back to the unconscious habits of an unjust past."

Who could help her see how she cant lose even if she will likely not beat Attorney General Greg Abbott? There is really only one man: coach Eric Taylor.

He knows what its like for ambition and loss to coexist in your head, and he knows the way forward. Close that door. Listen to me. I said you need to strive to be better than everyone else. I didnt say you needed to be better than everyone else. But you gotta try. Thats what character is. Its in the try.  Working harder than feels possible now could change the national chessboard. Republicans are dying to take back the U.S. Senate and defend vulnerable governors. Every out-of-state dollar coming into Texas to beat Davis is a dollar not handing the Senate to Mitch McConnell. The same goes for in-state Republican money. If Texas Republicans have to fight for Texas, Texas is no longer a campaign-cash ATM for national GOP races. Thats not just a win. Its a game-changer. Dont just stand by and watch it happen. Demographics is not destiny. Democracy is destiny. Its time to show progress on Election Day. Not losing badly would be a win. Gov. Rick Perrys three election victories have come with margins of 13 percentage points in 2010, 10 percentage points in 2006, and 18 percentage points in 2002. Losing by single digits would show progress. Losing by less than five would show that Texas has become a swing state. A few will never give up on you. When you go back out on the field, those are the people I want in your minds. Those are the people I want in your hearts. Davis has a rare opportunity to start her first statewide campaign as the most popular politician in Texas. Her campaign can accelerate the grassroots change Battleground Texas is working toward by recruiting volunteers, registering voters and adding to the donor base. Run smartly, a Davis gubernatorial campaign could leave Texas without a Gov. Davis but with the statewide campaign infrastructure weve lacked since Ann Richards lost. We will all at some time in our lives fall. Life is so very fragile, we are all vulnerable and we will all at some point in our lives  fall. We will all fall. We must carry this in our hearts, that what we have is special, that it can be taken from us and that when it is taken from us, we will be tested. We will be tested to our very souls. We will all be tested. It is these times, it is this pain, that allows us to look inside ourselves. Texas Democrats are not a resilient bunch. The 2002 elections left our donor corps feeling betrayed and hopeless. The same thing happened to our activist base when our beloved country somehow got it into its head to re-elect George W. Bush. We got so close to winning back the statehouse, only to fall into the irrelevance of a super-minority. But that aint nothing compared to losing your daddy. The pain Davis feels is the hurt of country songs and childhood fears. We feel her pain, and if she can put herself together and take on this fight, she will have taught Texas Democrats something about toughness we havent seen since a divorced alcoholic whupped all manner of gentlemen to take the Governors Mansion. Every man at some point in his life is going to lose a battle. He is going to fight, and he is going to lose. But what makes him a man is at the midst of that battle, he does not lose himself. This game is not over, this battle is not over. If only Coach Taylor were real. If he taught us one thing, it was that fighting the good fight with clear eyes and a full heart is the only way you cant possibly lose. What the hell? You want a hug or something? Get out of here."

http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/mar/24/kathleen-sebelius/kathleen-sebelius-obamacare-understates-costs/,"U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius came Friday to a health clinic in East Austin to hear the stories of a couple of young invincibles who made it past the glitches of HealthCare.gov to get cost-saving insurance coverage  success stories Sebelius can tout to the world, and most likely to a congressional committee when she is called to account next week. Once I tell your story, people will be tracking you down, Sebelius warned Kat Richards, 24, and Mark Sullivan, 31, after they shared their positive experience with her and a media horde crowded into a small room at the CommUnityCare health center on Comal Street. But, she said, after getting their permission to retell their tales, its really helpful to let people know what this looks like by talking about real people. The smiling, soft-spoken former Kansas governor has been at the center of a din of criticism, and calls for her resignation, since the bungled rollout of the new health care website, which was designed to enable people to shop for and enroll in health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. The visit to Texas  she also stopped in San Antonio  in advance of her testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Wednesday, seemed designed to find and feature some successful examples of the much-maligned website at work, and to encourage folks to look at three alternative methods to sign up. While the website is being upgraded, she suggested using the 24-hour toll free number  800-318-2596  or mailing in a paper application, or coming in person to places, like the federally qualified health center she was visiting, where they can be guided through the process. Sebelius also sought to put the websites current problems in perspective, promising they will be fixed in plenty of time so that no one should fear missing out on coverage or discounts. Saying she knows how much Texans like their football, Sebelius put it this way: Were three weeks into a 26-week enrollment period. In football terminology, were early in the first quarter. Asked whether the site was launched before it was ready or adequately tested, Sebelius said, In an ideal world there would have been a lot more testing, but we didnt have the luxury of that. We had a law that said its go time on Oct. 1. The look-back is, would more testing have helped? You bet, said Sebelius. On the other hand, we will get this site up and running. Sebelius said the site had been tested and found capable of accommodating five times the traffic of the governments Medicare site, which authorities figured would be sufficient, but that they were quite wrong about that Believe me, no one is more unhappy  oh, maybe the president is more unhappy  but this is a top priority, said Sebelius, who said new technical and managerial talent had been brought in to fix the problems. The website is considered especially crucial for drawing in what are known as young invincibles  the generally healthy demographic from ages 18 to 35, who pay into but are generally not a big draw on health benefits. The Obama administration has estimated that about a third of the people on the exchanges need to be from this group to make the Affordable Care Acts math work, and a state-of-the-art website was considered essential for this tech-savvy target audience. Both Kat Richards and Mark Sullivan proved not just to be young invincibles, but quite persistent. Richards works for a small family-owned print shop in Austin with about 10 employees. They offer insurance, but it was a little expensive and out of my price range, Richards told Sebelius and Mayor Lee Leffingwell, who joined her at the event. I went on the website the day it opened, said Richards, running into the typical, too many people on the website. But I tried and tried every day for about 15 days until I eventually got through, and I was happy with the options. It was half the price that it would have been through my employer, and my employer is so awesome she offered to pay half of that. Sullivan, who left his old job on Sept. 30 to launch his own Web-based business, said he will also be paying less than he had because of the tax credit offered under the Affordable Care Act. I look at it as an entrepreneurial tax credit, he said. But John Davidson, a health care policy analyst with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, who watched from the back, said that a lot of young invincibles are going to be paying a lot more than they would have in the past, without being eligible for any subsidy."

The burst of aggressive ads between Dan Branch, a state representative from Dallas, and Ken Paxton, a state senator from McKinney, will get extra attention because of the lack of debates or candidate forums scheduled before the May 27 vote.

In essence, the race will hinge on whether Branch can persuade hard-line conservatives to abandon their allegiance to Paxton, who finished first in the March primary but fell short of avoiding a runoff.

“It’s pretty clear that Paxton had an advantage coming out of the primary,” said Jim Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas. “Branch has to change the voters’ view of Paxton.”

In his bid to come from behind, Branch has launched a TV spot titled “Ken Paxton Broke the Law.”

Paxton is expected to start airing commercials soon that tout his conservative credentials and tries to brand Branch as a liberal. The campaign already has revived a radio ad from the primary in which Sen. Ted Cruz praises Paxton.

Paxton, in his debut run for statewide office, benefited in the primary from his connection to the party’s right flank.

So far in the runoff, Branch — also a first-time statewide contender — has been pounding Paxton over his business practices.

He has tried to capitalize on what he’s called ethical breaches, including the State Securities Board’s fining Paxton for not disclosing that he made income by soliciting clients for a North Texas financial services firm.

“We’re working hard and trying to make the case that I’m the most qualified for this position,” Branch said. “I’ve got an opponent who, with the securities law violations and ethics violations, is not only not qualified, but he’s disqualified himself.”

Paxton dismissed Branch’s attack and said he moved quickly to comply with state rules, update his financial disclosure reports and accept the Security Board’s fine.

Branch has highlighted endorsements from Republican leaders, including Railroad Commission Chairman Barry Smitherman.

Smitherman finished third in the primary for attorney general and had indicated he would stay neutral in the second round. But last week he broke his silence and backed Branch.

No-risk campaign

For the runoff, Paxton appears to be embracing a no-risk campaign, rejecting Branch’s call to meet in debates.

Paxton has conducted few major media interviews since the primary. And he declined to appear on Sunday’s edition of Lone Star Politics. The show, which aired on KXAS-TV (NBC5), featured only Branch.

Paxton spokesman Anthony Holm said Paxton isn’t interested in sparring with Branch.

“We’re not worried about responding to our liberal opponent,” Holm said. “We will have the resources needed to communicate our message and speak to our voters about issues.”

The liberal tag, said the Paxton campaign, is because Branch during his time in the Legislature wanted “driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants, third trimester abortions and once lobbied on behalf of the AFL-CIO.”

“We continue to talk to every voter about the issues,” Holm said. “There’s a stark contrast between Ken Paxton’s long record as a constitutional conservative and the liberal Dan Branch.”

In response, Branch campaign spokesman Enrique Marquez said the votes cited by Paxton are false or are being taken out of context. He accused Paxton of being “delusional.”

“Ken Paxton may have broken securities law and may be at risk of losing his law license,” Marquez said. “Texans want an attorney general to enforce the laws. Ken Paxton can’t even obey the law.”

Agreement on issues

Most Texans were unfamiliar with Paxton and Branch when they began their drive to succeed Greg Abbott, now the Republican nominee for governor. Both men generally agreed on the issues, blasting the federal health care law and promising to fight government overreach.

From the start, Paxton has urged voters to consider his record as a reliable conservative as evidence that he would be an attorney general in the mode of Abbott, if not Cruz.

Though he didn’t have the campaign resources enjoyed by Branch, he broke from the pack by releasing a 30-second TV ad featuring Cruz praising Paxton at an East Texas rally.

Afterward, Paxton charged to the lead, beating Branch in the first round by 11 percentage points.

Cruz has not made an official endorsement in the race.

Branch increasingly has targeted Paxton as being unfit to be attorney general.

Friday, he unveiled an ad that features Paxton’s state Securities Board fine, reprising an on-air news story narrated by NBC5 anchor Bianca Castro. It contains nothing else, and NBC5 officials have asked the Branch campaign to pull it from the airwaves.

“KXAS objects to any use of its journalists and our copyrighted material that suggests to the public that we or our journalists are taking sides” in a political campaign, “and we request that your organization respect that concern,” said NBC vice president David Sternlicht.

Paxton had to amend personal financial disclosure reports after a Texas Tribune report on his paid work to solicit clients for a North Texas financial services firm. He was not a registered financial services broker and did not report the arrangement on personal financial reports on file with the Texas Ethics Commission.

The winner of the GOP race will be heavily favored to defeat Democratic lawyer Sam Houston in the fall.

http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/dec/21/if-you-only-news/news-entertainment-service-incorrectly-says-texas-/,"It’s been a noted repeatedly that many Republicans, particularly ones stuck in poverty or in need of government assistance, vote time and again against their own self-interests. Whether it’s being exploited by the Christian Right’s fear-mongering about gay marriage or Donald Trump’s fear-mongering about immigrants, these voters support the party that doesn’t support them.

And if that’s not infuriating enough, they just helped re-elect a party that is going after their children, particularly the most vulnerable of them. Texas, a state that for a brief moment during the election looked like it might reject Trump and go blue, instead stuck with Republicans. And this is what they got.

In an all-out assault on the social safety net, Texas Republicans have seized the opportunity to finalize and enact a series of brutal budget cuts. Naturally, when this group of GOPers went looking for places to save money, they focused on programs that helped the poor – welfare and Medicaid. The cuts into medical help were particularly egregious – $350 million evaporated from Medicaid funding in an instant. That means less financial help for the sick. Less coverage for the poor. Less preventative care. Less reimbursements for costly medical procedures. Less lives saved.

But we haven’t even gotten to the worst part yet:

More than a year after lawmakers originally ordered it, Texas announced Monday it will enact significant cuts to the money that it pays therapists who treat vulnerable children with disabilities in two weeks.

Medicaid reimbursement rates are used to pay for pediatric therapy services provided to disabled babies and toddlers. Carrie Williams, spokeswoman for the state’s Health and Human Services Commission, said that Texas will apply cuts on Medicaid rates on Dec. 15 in attempt to achieve savings directed by the Texas Legislature in 2015.
Two weeks before Christmas, the party of “pro-life” is stripping money away from the parents of children and babies with disabilities.

As Stephanie Rubin, the head of an children’s care advocacy group in Texas, notes just what is lost by this heartless action. Republicans aren’t just taking away money, they are taking away the ability to walk, the ability to talk, and go to school.

“This is terrible news for Texas kids with disabilities and developmental delays and their families,” Rubin said. “Kids with autism, speech delays, Down syndrome, and other disabilities and delays rely on these therapies to learn to walk, communicate with their families, get ready for school, and meet other goals.”
In other words, to save some money in the budget, Republicans are robbing these children of their place in society.

Even more insane, Republican officials testified in court during the decision to pass this budget that they have absolutely no idea how the victims would be affected. They just didn’t care.

So this Christmas, Texan might want to take the time to take a hard look at themselves. There was an easy fix to this, an opportunity to reject the heartless cruelty on display from the party that has repeatedly shown no interest in helping them or their families. Instead they voted for the same old group. They voted for tax cuts for the rich and financial ruin for the families of the disabled. They voted for Trump.

Get it together, Texas. It’s not every day you get to have choices as clear as this one, and you blew it.

http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/jul/28/matt-mackowiak/mostly-false-claim-texas-mayor-julian-castro-got-b/,"Let me begin this column as a Texan: It would be a proud moment for our state to have one of its own serve as vice president of the United States, regardless of party or ideology. That said, Julian Castro, who is currently serving as secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), is manifestly unqualified to be vice president and sit just one heartbeat away from the presidency. We know that Hillary Clinton is 69 years old and has had some health problems in recent years. Her choice of running mate takes on added significance given this reality. As a conservative, I would not favor any of her likely choices, though I would more strongly disapprove of hardcore liberals like U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, whose ideology is way outside the mainstream. ANOTHER VIEW: Why Clinton should choose HUD Secretary Julian Castro for VP HUD secretary is not serious preparation to be president. But lets be serious: HUD secretary is one small slice of domestic policy. It ignores entirely foreign policy and national security, the most important responsibilities for any president  or vice president. You could fit the entirety of Castros knowledge of foreign policy and national security on a bubble gum wrapper. He is unknown to world leaders, has almost surely never received a classified intelligence briefing, and has never served in Congress. His sole executive role before HUD was as a part-time mayor. For five years, Castro served as mayor of San Antonio, which claims to be the nations seventh-largest city. It misleadingly claims only the population in the city limits, not the metro area. Under San Antonios system of government, the city manager runs the city  not the mayor, whose power is very limited. But dont take my word for it. WOAI-AM, a news radio station in San Antonio, once named Castro the fourth most powerful person in his city. The city manager, Sheryl Sculley, was first. RELATED READ: Will Julin Castro be Hillary Clintons vice presidential candidate? Castros five years as mayor peaked when he campaigned for and passed a sales tax increase to fund his universal pre-K initiative. Other than that, his actual accomplishments on issues like crime and public education were very limited. As National Reviews Jim Geraghty has written: Castro is indeed a lot like the Barack Obama of 2004: a subject of endless glowing media profiles, touted as the voice of an entire ethnic group, charisma by the bucketful  and (has) a short record of quite modest achievements. The vast majority of the discussion about Castro focuses on his enormous potential and what is to come, not on his accomplishments and what he has done. The most significant accomplishment of Castro is probably that he was offered the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. It was his national debut, even though the Castro PR machine had been running at full speed since at least 2010, when The New York Times Magazine profiled him. What are Castros views on defeating Islamic State? Isolating Russia? Brexit? Monetary policy? Tax reform? It would be impossible to know. Politically, I do not believe Castro makes sense. His nomination will raise serious questions about his qualifications, forcing Hillary Clintons campaign on the defense. He doesnt make Texas a blue state. He doesnt speak Spanish. He has no constituency. Housing issues will not be central to this campaign. The selection of a Latino running mate surely has some appeal, given Donald Trumps historic weakness with Hispanic voters. But former U.S. Sen. Ken Salazar of Colorado would be a credible choice, as would U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra of California. Perhaps most seriously, how Castro earned a living while serving as mayor will come under intense scrutiny. In 2009, his first year as mayor, Castro received a seven-figure referral fee from notorious personal injury lawyer Mikal Watts, a major Obama donor. What Castro did to earn this fee, which smells like a dirty financial gift from a wealthy trial lawyer to a sitting elected official, will receive a lot of attention  especially since Watts was indicted on federal fraud charges in 2015. Castro has been a rising star in the Democratic Party since 2009. He is unquestionably unqualified to be vice president. Mackowiak is syndicated columnist, an Austin-based Republican consultant and a former Capitol Hill and Bush administration aide."
http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/jul/29/jeannette-vaught/researcher-rounds-wrong-figure-texas-cattle/,"Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner who has been embroiled in one controversy or another since his inauguration in January 2015, is instantly recognizable. The brim of his broad white hat defines the visual outlines of his political persona  and its part of a concerted effort on his part to create a memorable and marketable image. And a lot of the time, he succeeds. The intentional and less-desirable publicity Miller has received is a facet of his visual and literal associations with rodeo. Miller is the most easily identified Texas agriculture commissioner in recent memory, but only in part because of his savvy marketing. Miller has recently faced national scrutiny and ridicule for using state funds to participate in a rodeo in Mississippi and to allegedly receive a pain-relief injection common to rodeo competitors called the Jesus shot. It is no accident that Millers political career is tied to his participation in rodeo, or that he has drawn on his rodeo identity to market his image. Rodeo and the beef industry share historical ties, dating to when Texas was at the center of a nascent American cattle culture. From the first informal rodeos, where makeshift arenas corralled a diverse group of cattle workers for ranch audiences, the men at the center of rodeo were the same men at the center of the beef trade. Professional rodeo did not become a nationally popular spectacle until after World War II. Young ranch men, such as Harley May from Alpine, returned from war to enroll in agricultural colleges  and many brought rodeo with them. May and a group of his young, veteran college peers inaugurated the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association. By the late 1950s, May was president of the first national rodeo governing body, the Rodeo Cowboys Association, which organized the existing regional rodeo patchwork and brought professional rodeo to a national audience  all the while using his agricultural education to grow a successful cattle operation. Men like May used their agricultural educations to make both beef and rodeo successful businesses. In the process, rodeo became a staging ground for conservative politics, as it mobilized a celebration of ranching tradition alongside a policy agenda that favored the growth of large cattle operations. In fact, since the 1950s, there have been connections between conservative politicians and professional rodeo. May specially honored Republican President Dwight Eisenhower at the first National Finals Rodeo in 1959. Ronald Reagans secretary of commerce, Malcolm Baldrige, died while competing in a rodeo during his time in office. And Miller is a lifetime member of the Houston Rodeo and was crowned a world champion calf roper in 2004. Rodeo has doubled in popularity over the past 40 years, paralleling the growth of industrial beef  which concentrates huge numbers of cattle on feedlots  or confined animal feeding operations. The problem with rodeos popularity, however, is that it has made cattle ranching serve as a visual and cultural shorthand for agriculture. This fusion of agriculture with beef obscures the diversity of agricultural products and producers in Texas. The high economic impact of beef is wildly disproportionate to the states geography: Only five Texas counties account for almost 90 percent of the cattle industry. Millers emphasis on his rodeo identity as his main public relations wheelhouse continues this disparity in the eyes of Texans who may not be aware of the actual and potential diversity of agriculture in the state. Professional rodeo has been formed over time to reproduce the myth of conquest of the West, gradually erasing contributions from African-American, indigenous and Mexican influences to produce the spectacle we now recognize. In conflating ranching with Texas agriculture, we similarly lose the historical contributions of enslaved cotton laborers, freed black horticulturists, women subsistence farmers and independent farmers. Today, Millers rodeo image makes it hard to see  and support  the farmers who live beyond the five counties that make up the vast majority of what counts as Texas agriculture. Its time we get out from under the hat and contribute to the health of all Texas producers, in all their complexity."

Donald Trump's education plan to dramatically slash funding for public education would fire 49,000 Texas teachers.

What does that say about Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick, both of whom have doubled-down in their support for Trump?

A new analysis from the Center from American Progress finds that Trump's plan to eliminate the Department of Education would have severe consequences across the country, especially here in Texas. This comes on the heels of a previous report that finds that Trump's economic plans could cause 266,000 jobs lost in Texas.

From CAP's report:

Using official budget figures from the Department of Education, CAPAF’s full analysis shows just how far reaching the impact of Trump’s proposals could be on students, teachers, and families. Our analysis examined the largest programs that the agency runs in order to demonstrate what their elimination would mean for the country and for each state. 

The key figures in Texas are shocking: 49,045 teachers would lose their job, and 760,203 students would lose their funding.

That's even worse than student education cuts that Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick have defended in the past - which may explain why they have no problem with Trump's horrible plans for education.

http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/dec/08/ryan-sitton/ryan-sitton-errantly-says-12-million-people-left-w/,"Earlier this year, Hurricane Harvey left more than a million people in Texas and Louisiana without homes. The devastation of this storm was more far-reaching than anyone imagined. My neighborhood in southeast Houston received more than 56 inches of rain. Although the hurricane has passed, my thoughts and prayers are still with all those working to rebuild their lives. At one point, Hurricane Harvey effectively shuttered 24% of the nations refining capacity, and as much as 10% of US drilling was expected to be delayed. Pipeline infrastructure, including the Magellan, Explorer and Colonial pipelines, were taken offline. Power outages affected natural gas liquid (NGL) fractionating plants. The Gulf of Mexicos share of US production was cut from above 25% to below 5%. The Port of Corpus Christi, the nations No. 1 crude oil export port, closed for six days. These impacts left the nation with another point of concern  how would Texas, the US and the world meet energy needs? Both government and industry worked quickly to fill energy demand and bring infrastructure back online, but the effect on the global market, while not devastating, was undeniable. Gasoline futures rose nearly 7%, and the dollar weakened to a 16-month low. The idea that one state could impact the world in such a way makes it clear  Texas natural resources are the key to Americas energy security. Our current federal administration has emphasized that an all-of-the-above strategy is paramount to the continued success of American energy. Every nation wants clean, affordable and reliable energy sources, but until now, producing that has been a challenge. Where some countries are rich with natural resources, they lack infrastructure and refining facilities. Where others have natural resources and infrastructure, they lack an experienced workforce. In Texas, we have the natural resources, pipelines, ports, workforce and regulatory environment that allow us to produce energy cleaner and more efficiently than anyone else. These components, paired with our all-of-the-above energy portfolio, have made Texas the leading net exporter of energy in the US. Further, the state produces 41% more energy than it consumes. Lets put that into perspective. While fossil fuels dominate Texas energy production, renewables account for a significant portion of our electricity grid. In Q1 2017, wind generation accounted for nearly 23% of power generation for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). ERCOT also projects that solar power could contribute up to 28,100 megawatts to the grid within 10 to 15 years. Two nuclear plants supply one-tenth of the states net electricity generation. Texas produces more than a third of the countrys crude oil, and with untapped reserves in the Alpine High, Permian Basin and Eagle Ford, our production continues to grow. The state is also home to 15 coal-fired power plants and is the seventh-largest coal producer in the nation. Natural gas arguably has the most potential, and the country receives more than one-fourth of this resource from Texas. As the US exponentially grows its production of clean and reliable energy like natural gas  which surpassed coal as a power source for the first time in 2016  we are also significantly reducing emissions and providing clean energy to our allies overseas. The US decreased emissions by 15% between 2005 and 2016, not because of the Paris Accord or Clean Power Plan but because of technological advancements from the industry, like hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing in the US has created thousands of jobs, enhanced our economic and national security, and reduced emissions from electric-generation facilities. This technique has allowed producers to unlock shale plays and develop abundant natural gas reserves, which are now being shipped from our ports to more than 20 countries around the world, like China, Pakistan and India. Take, for example, Mexicos reliance on American natural gas. Right now, Mexico imports about 112,000 million cu ft of natural gas each month from Texas via pipeline. By 2019, US natural gas exports to Mexico will double, and that means more money for our schools, roads, hospitals and economy. Mexicos energy reforms and demand, coupled with near historic highs in US production, are creating an enormous opportunity from which both countries will benefit. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is also creating economic opportunities for Texas and the nation. The US Energy Information Administration predicts US LNG exports will increase from 1.4 Bcf/day at the end of 2016 to 9.5 Bcf/day by the end of 2019. With this growth, economists are predicting the US will be a global leader in energy exports by 2022. Prior to the shale boom in 2008, the United States believed it did not have enough natural gas to meet its demand. Import facilities were built to take in natural gas from other countries. But now we need to begin thinking differently about the role energy plays in the world. Texas natural gas production, the innovation of our drillers and refined products exports are disrupting the global market, securing our economic growth and national security, and placing the US in a position of energy dominance.

The study, conducted by St. Edwards University and commissioned by the Texas Association of Business, is part of a newly formed, broad-based, statewide coalition of businesses committed to Keep Texas Open for Business. Discriminatory legislation is bad for business. Our economic study points to the dire and far-reaching impact of discriminatory legislation on Texas businesses, our communities, families, jobs and the larger state economy, said Chris Wallace, President of the Texas Association of Business (TAB). We must Keep Texas Open for Business. We cannot slam the door on the Texas Miracle of openness, competitiveness, economic opportunity and innovation. TABs economic impact study found that passage of discriminatory legislation could: Result in significant economic losses in Texas GDP, with estimates ranging from $964 million to $8.5 billion; Lead to significant Texas job losses with estimates as high as 185,000 jobs statewide; and Drastically impact Texas convention and tourism industry, which has a direct economic impact of $69 billion, generates more than $6 billion in state and local tax revenues, and directly and indirectly supports more than 1.1 million Texas jobs. The complete economic impact study is available online at _LINKS_. Texas needs to continue to strive for excellence in education, infrastructure, and health, said State Representative Sarah Davis (R-Houston). Those priorities - not divisive issues that won't move our state forward - deserve our time and attention. We need to protect our tourism industry, attract investment, and provide a healthy environment for small businesses to thrive. I stand with the business community in their commitment to safeguarding the economic health of the Lone Star State. As a state, we must remain committed to protecting Texas reputation of being economically vibrant and welcoming, said Duff Stewart, CEO of GSD&M. Discrimination against anyone will hinder Texas business climate and culturepositive traits that especially define Austins reputation and attract the diverse talent pool that is critical to our creative city. As a company born and raised here, we recognize the damage division will have on the success of business and denounce the pursuit of discrimination. Business and state leaders joined TABs Wallace and GSD&Ms Stewart on the steps of the State Capitol to highlight the profoundly negative impact discriminatory legislation could pose to Texas ability to attract, recruit and retain top talent, encourage new business relocations, expansions and investment and maintain our economic competitiveness. Texas must do all it can to ensure that it remains open to business for all, said Caroline Joiner, TechNets Executive Director for Texas. We are battling workforce shortages and increasing demands for science and technology talent in Texas and across the U.S. If Texas intends to compete, we need to reject discrimination and embrace state policy that values education, diversity, inclusion and innovation. Keep Texas Open for Business strongly opposes any legislation that amends the existing Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act and opens the law up to broader interpretations and potentially costly litigation, all of which could have lasting economic impacts on our state. Together, the Texas Legislature and the business community have worked together to make a strong, more economically vibrant Texas. We need lawmakers to focus on critical issues like public education funding, transportation, child welfare, business and property tax reform. They should oppose divisive, unnecessary discriminatory legislation said Wallace.

DACA granted lawful presence and work permits to nearly one million unlawfully present aliens without Congressional authorization. On June 29, Attorney General Paxton sent a letter  co-signed by nine state attorneys general and one governor  to the Trump administration, giving it until September 5 to phase out DACA or the coalition would challenge the program in court. I applaud President Trump for phasing out DACA. As the Texas-led coalition explained in our June letter, the Obama-era program went far beyond the executive branchs legitimate authority, Attorney General Paxton said. Had former President Obamas unilateral order on DACA been left intact, it would have set a dangerous precedent by giving the executive branch sweeping authority to bypass Congress and change immigration laws. If ever there were a violation of the Presidents duty to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, DACA was it: President Obama unilaterally conferred lawful presence and work authorization, and then President Obama used that lawful-presence dispensation to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship. Texas has a proven track record in protecting liberty and taking on abuse of federal power. When former President Obama sought to grant lawful presence to more than four million unlawfully present aliens, Attorney General Paxton led a 26-state coalition all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to stop his unlawful immigration plan, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA).

http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2018/may/02/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-falsely-beto-orourke-legalize-narcotics-a/,"Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas Beto ORourke once advocated for the legalization of all narcotics, The Daily Caller News Foundation has learned. ORourke, as a member of the El Paso, Texas, city council in 2009, put forth and passed a resolution urging the federal government to support an honest, open national debate on ending the prohibition of narcotics. WATCH: And Id ask that there be some language in here that would also include advocating, or looking at, rethinking our War on Drugs, which by any measure Ive looked it has been an abject failure. And also, looking at ending the prohibition on narcotics in the United States. And Im not saying that we need to do that  to end the prohibition, ORourke said in a Jan. 6, 2009 city council meeting. I think we need to have a serious discussion about doing that, and that may, in the end, be the right course of action. The resolution was met with immediate attacks from the Texas state delegation and from members of the council. Facing intense pressure, then-El Paso City Mayor John Cook vetoed the resolution, but ORourke persisted, pushing to override the mayors veto. Former Democratic Rep. Silvestre Reyes of Texas, who ORourke challenged and defeated in 2012, wrote members of the El Paso city council on Jan. 13, 2009 to ask that they vote against overriding Mayor Cooks veto. ORourkes final attempt to legalize narcotics ultimately failed, although his advocacy and persistence during a time when the nations opioid and drug overdose crisis was starting to take off is something to note. ORourkes team did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding the resolution and his previous statements. Some 16,651 Americans died from overdoses of prescription opioid pain relievers in 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is only one year after ORourke introduced his resolution and only represents the deaths related to prescription narcotics. Since 2010, deaths from drug overdoses have skyrocketed to the point of a legitimate crisis plaguing every region of the nation. Drug overdose deaths surged 21 percent in 2016, taking 63,000 American lives. The increase came primarily from opioids, which claimed 42,429 lives in 2016. Well over 71,000 Americans are estimated to have lost their lives from opioid and drug related use in 2017. ORourke is currently running on a belief that he has championed since his days in the El Paso city council: ending the war on Drugs. His campaign website calls for an end (to) the U.S. governments war on drugs and encourage comprehensive reforms in drug control policies that have had a devastating effect on communities of color. ORourke, notably, trailed Cruz only 3 percentage points in a mid-February Quinnipiac poll, causing many around the nation to believe the often circulated theory that Texas is going blue. Quinnipiac polls all registered voters in Texas, which causes some conservative pundits to question the results, since just over a quarter of registered voters cast ballots in 2014. The Republican party has held the governors seat and both Senate seats for nearly 20 years. ORourke still has roughly 8 months to campaign and try to continue to gain ground on Cruz.

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/01/michele-bachmann/defending-dollar-bachmann-distorts-geithners-comme/,"Washington, D.C., Mar 25 - In response to suggestions by China, Russia, and other countries around the world calling on the International Monetary Fund to explore a multi-national currency, U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann (MN-6) has introduced a resolution that would bar the dollar from being replaced by any foreign currency.

“Yesterday, during a Financial Services Committee hearing, I asked Secretary Geithner if he would denounce efforts to move towards a global currency and he answered unequivocally that he would,"" said Bachmann. ""And President Obama gave the nation the same assurances. But just a day later, Secretary Geithner has left the option on the table. I want to know which it is. The American people deserve to know.""

Asked today about a currency proposal from China at a Council on Foreign Relations event, Secretary Geithner stated he was open to supporting it. Despite attempts to clarify his remarks later in the day, the unguarded initial response calls into question his true intentions.

Although Title 31, Sec. 5103 USC prohibits foreign currency from being recognized in the U.S., the President has the power to engage foreign governments in treaties, and the President is principally responsible for the interpretations and implementation of those treaties according to the Constitution. As a result, legislation prohibiting the President and Treasury from issuing or agreeing that the U.S. will adopt an international currency would need to come in the form of a Constitutional Amendment differentiating a treaty used to implement an international currency in the U.S. from other types of treaty agreements.

                                                                 ###"
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/07/john-boehner/boehner-says-democrats-health-care-plan-would-lead/,"When most Americans talk about the need for health-care reform, they’re usually talking about the need to address rising health-care costs; they aren’t talking about the need for taxpayers to subsidize abortion. In fact, a November 2008 Zogby poll revealed 71 percent of Americans oppose government-funded abortion.

It seems Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill don’t share this perspective, however. With the unequivocal support of President Obama, they’ve written a health-care bill that won’t lower health-care costs for American families, but will require them to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars.

In his campaign for the presidency, President Obama said health-care legislation should include expanded access to abortion. He hasn't said much on the matter since taking office last January. But now, over the objections of some in his own party, President Obama is demanding that Congress pass health-care legislation before August, and the House is slated to vote next week on a bill that will fulfill the president’s vow if signed into law.

The Obama administration contends the urgent deadline is necessitated by the suffering of American families who have waited too long for Congress to act to address the high cost of health care. But according to the independent Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the bill the president supports won't lower health-care costs; it will increase them. And as the veteran political operatives in the Obama White House well know, the frantic timetable conveniently leaves precious little time for the American people to know what's actually in the bill.

The legislation's abortion-related language stands as Exhibit A. How many Americans currently realize the House bill contains provisions that will result in federally mandated coverage of abortion on demand in virtually all of America's health plans?

Fact: The bill as currently written will allow the federal government to classify abortion as an ""essential benefit"" — a health-care right that would be guaranteed to all Americans. This will make it illegal for health-care providers nationwide — even Catholic and religious-based hospitals with missions that reflect a fundamental moral objection to the killing of the unborn — to provide anything less than abortion on demand for anyone who seeks it. As a result, the bill will repeal laws in many states that currently require commonsense limitations on abortion-on-demand, such as mandatory parental notification and waiting periods.

Fact: The bill would also establish a taxpayer-funded ""public"" health-care plan to ""compete"" with private-sector plans. This public plan, like all plans, will be required to classify abortion as an ""essential benefit,"" forcing American citizens to directly subsidize abortion-on-demand with their tax dollars. And in addition to the public plan, individuals with incomes of up to 400% of the poverty level will receive subsidies to buy insurance to pay for abortion-on-demand.

Reps. Eric Cantor (R. Va.), Sam Johnson (R., Texas), and Mark Souder (R., Ind.) offered amendments this month in three different House committees to strike the provisions from the Democratic bill that force American taxpayers to subsidize abortion. All three amendments, sadly, were defeated by the Democratic majority in committee. And it remains to be seen whether Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), who champions the House bill and its abortion-related provisions, will allow such an amendment to be considered and debated on the House floor.

Indeed, Congress may vote on this issue and send a bill to the president before most Americans even have a chance to weigh in on it. And once the bill reaches his desk, there's little doubt that the president will sign it.

Peter Orszag, President Obama’s budget director, was asked July 19 whether the president would pledge that ""no taxpayer money will go to pay for abortions"" under the health-care bill he signs.

“I am not prepared to say explicitly that right now,"" Mr. Orszag said. ""It’s obviously a controversial issue, and it’s one of the questions that is playing out in this debate.”

Controversial, indeed. And given its controversial nature, it deserves a full and open public debate — the sort of debate that is impossible when major bills are rammed through Congress based on politically driven timetables.

If a health-care bill doesn't lower costs for middle-class families, but does require them to subsidize abortion-on-demand with their hard-earned tax dollars, one has to ask a fundamental question: For whom was this bill actually written? Was it written for the millions of Americans who were promised a health-care bill that lowers costs? Or is it really for the radical special-interest and lobbying groups that invested millions to elect a cooperative president and Congress?

Health care is too important to get wrong. Too much is at stake. For the sake of American families struggling with health-care costs — most of whom don’t want their hard-earned money being used by the federal government to subsidize abortion — President Obama should scrap the current health-care bill, and work in a bipartisan way for true reforms.

Indeed, activists made trouble in 2005 by asking Congressmen tough questions about policy. Activists are making trouble now by shouting Congressmen down so they cant be heard. Its exactly the same thing, right? Seriously, Ive been searching through news reports on the Social Security town halls, and I cant find any examples of the kind of behavior were seeing now. Yes, there were noisy demonstrations  but they were outside the events. That was even true during the first month or two, when Republicans actually tried having open town halls. Congressmen were very upset by the reception they received, but not, at least according to any of the report I can find, because opponents were disruptive  crowds booed lines they didnt like, but that was about it. After that, the events were open only to demonstrated loyalists; you may recall the people arrested at a Bush Social Security event in Denver for the crime of  not being Bush supporters. So please, no false equivalences. The campaign against Social Security privatization was energetic and no doubt rude, but did not involve intimidation and disruption."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/13/sarah-palin/palin-claims-obama-misled-when-he-said-end-life-co/,"Yesterday President Obama responded to my statement that Democratic health care proposals would lead to rationed care; that the sick, the elderly, and the disabled would suffer the most under such  rationing; and that under such a system these “unproductive” members of society could face the prospect of government  bureaucrats determining whether they deserve health care.

The President made light of these concerns. He said:

“Let me just be specific about some things that I’ve been hearing lately that we just need to dispose of here.  The rumor that’s been circulating a lot lately is this idea that somehow the House of Representatives voted for death panels that will basically pull the plug on grandma because we’ve decided that we don’t, it’s too expensive to let her live anymore....It turns out that I guess this arose out of a provision in one of the House bills that allowed Medicare to reimburse people for consultations about end-of-life care, setting up living wills, the availability of hospice, etc. So the intention of the members of Congress was to give people more information so that they could handle issues of end-of-life care when they’re ready on their own terms.  It wasn’t forcing anybody to do anything.” [1]

The provision that President Obama refers to is Section 1233 of HR 3200, entitled “Advance Care Planning Consultation.” [2]  With all due respect, it’s misleading for the President to describe this section as an entirely voluntary provision that simply increases the information offered to Medicare recipients.  The issue is the context in which that information is provided and the coercive effect these consultations will have in that context.

Section 1233 authorizes advanced care planning consultations for senior citizens on Medicare every five years, and more often “if there is a significant change in the health condition of the individual ... or upon admission to a skilled nursing facility, a long-term care facility... or a hospice program."" [3] During those consultations, practitioners must explain “the continuum of end-of-life services and supports available, including palliative care and hospice,” and the government benefits available to pay for such services. [4]

Now put this in context.  These consultations are authorized whenever a Medicare recipient’s health changes significantly or when they enter a nursing home, and they are part of a bill whose stated purpose is “to reduce the growth in health care spending.” [5] Is it any wonder that senior citizens might view such consultations as attempts to convince them to help reduce health care costs by accepting minimal end-of-life care?  As Charles Lane notes in the Washington Post, Section 1233 “addresses compassionate goals in disconcerting proximity to fiscal ones.... If it’s all about obviating suffering, emotional or physical, what’s it doing in a measure to “bend the curve” on health-care costs?” [6]

As Lane also points out:

Though not mandatory, as some on the right have claimed, the consultations envisioned in Section 1233 aren’t quite “purely voluntary,” as Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.) asserts. To me, “purely voluntary” means “not unless the patient requests one.” Section 1233, however, lets doctors initiate the chat and gives them an incentive -- money -- to do so. Indeed, that’s an incentive to insist. 

Patients may refuse without penalty, but many will bow to white-coated authority. Once they’re in the meeting, the bill does permit “formulation” of a plug-pulling order right then and there. So when Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) denies that Section 1233 would “place senior citizens in situations where they feel pressured to sign end-of-life directives that they would not otherwise sign,” I don’t think he’s being realistic. [7]

Even columnist Eugene Robinson, a self-described “true believer” who “will almost certainly support” “whatever reform package finally emerges”, agrees that “If the government says it has to control health-care costs and then offers to pay doctors to give advice about hospice care, citizens are not delusional to conclude that the goal is to reduce end-of-life spending.” [8]

So are these usually friendly pundits wrong?  Is this all just a “rumor” to be “disposed of”, as President Obama says?  Not according to Democratic New York State Senator Ruben Diaz, Chairman of the New York State Senate Aging Committee, who writes:

Section 1233 of House Resolution 3200 puts our senior citizens on a slippery slope and may diminish respect for the inherent dignity of each of their lives.... It is egregious to consider that any senior citizen ... should be placed in a situation where he or she would feel pressured to save the government money by dying a little sooner than he or she otherwise would, be required to be counseled about the supposed benefits of killing oneself, or be encouraged to sign any end of life directives that they would not otherwise sign. [9]

Of course, it’s not just this one provision that presents a problem.  My original comments concerned statements made by Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a health policy advisor to President Obama and the brother of the President’s chief of staff. Dr. Emanuel has written that some medical services should not be guaranteed to those “who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens....An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia.” [10] Dr. Emanuel has also advocated basing medical decisions on a system which “produces a priority curve on which individuals aged between roughly 15 and 40 years get the most chance, whereas the youngest and oldest people get chances that are attenuated.” [11]

President Obama can try to gloss over the effects of government authorized end-of-life consultations, but the views of one of his top health care advisors are clear enough.  It’s all just more evidence that the Democratic legislative proposals will lead to health care rationing, and more evidence that the top-down plans of government bureaucrats will never result in real health care reform.

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/11/chain-email/bloggers-military-oath-bogus/,"Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is extremely frustrated with orders that the White House is contemplating. According to sources at the Pentagon, including all branches of the armed forces, the Obama Administration may break with a centuries-old tradition.

A spokesman for General James Cartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, states that the Obama Administration wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to the office of the President, and no longer to the Constitution.

""The oath to the Constitution is as old as the document itself."" the spokesman said, ""At no time in American history, not even in the Civil War, did the oath change or the subject of the oath differ. It has always been to the Constitution.""

The back-and-forth between the White House and the Defense Department was expected as President George W. Bush left office. President Obama has already signed orders to close Guantanamo and to pull combat troops from Iraq. But, this, say many at the Defense Department, goes too far.

""Technically, we can't talk about it before it becomes official policy."" the spokesman continued. ""However, the Defense Department, including the Secretary, will not take this laying down. Expect a fight from the bureaucracy and the brass.""

Sources at the White House had a different point of view. In a circular distributed by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, the rationale for the change was made more clear.

""The President feels that the military has been too indoctrinated by the old harbingers of hate: nationalism, racism, and classism. By removing an oath to the American society, the soldiers are less likely to commit atrocities like those at Abu Ghraib.""

""We expect a lot of flak over this,"" the classified memo continues. ""But those that would be most against it are those looking either for attention or control.""

The time frame for the changes are unknown. However, it is more likely that the changes will be made around the July 4th holiday, in order to dampen any potential backlash. The difference in the oath will actually only be slight. The main differences will be the new phrasing. It is expected that the oath to the Constitution will be entirely phased out within two years."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/25/mark-sanford/sanford-incorrectly-describes-rivlin-comment-stimu/,"Now that the so-called stimulus plan is law, we're left with one question: Will this package help us or hurt us? Unfortunately, I believe it is the latter, for a few reasons. First, this package will ultimately mean less, not more, economic activity. The Congressional Budget Office has found that this bill will lead to a real 0.1 to 0.3 percent reduction in gross domestic product by 2019. That translates into our economy losing tens of billions of dollars. Second, spending does not equal stimulus. From both sides of the political aisle -- from conservative economist Martin Feldstein, who originally supported a stimulus, to former Clinton administration budget director Alice Rivlin -- we hear that this particular bill won't actually stimulate the economy. Even two of President Obama's chief economic advisers, Peter Orszag and Christina Romer, earlier in their careers panned the idea that a massive infusion of government capital could provide the type of economic recovery we need now. History shows the same thing. Neither the Great Depression nor Japan's experience in the 1990s suggests that government spending alone creates jobs or economic growth. Billions in taxpayer dollars spent in the 10 years following the 1929 stock market crash didn't push the U.S. unemployment rate below the high teens. And despite no fewer than 10 stimulus packages implemented by the Japanese, their unemployment rate more than doubled during the ""lost decade."" Third, if you print enough money, you devalue it. We're moving to a tipping point of devaluing every American dollar and, as a consequence, rendering any short-term economic stimulation moot. Already in January the core-producer-price index -- one measure of inflation -- rose four times faster than what economists had expected. The more we spend what we don't have, the more this trend will continue. Finally, ad hoc bailout after ad hoc bailout is freezing the driver of our economic engine -- private capital. For entrepreneurs to take risks in the marketplace, they need to know what the rules are. Yet that's not possible when even the Treasury secretary's best answer to that question is effectively: Let me get back to you with those details. Unfortunately, the rush to do something for the sake of doing something means this bill is already law -- a mistake that we, and the generations to follow us, will have to live with. -- Mark Sanford Republican governor of South Carolina * * * I am grateful for Florida's fair share of the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The stimulus dollars coming to Florida are critical to our economy and will help the hardworking people of my state. These funds will serve as a bridge to better economic times. There is no doubt: These are historic and hard times for our nation. Yet I am optimistic about the future because of the innovation of our people, like the many hardworking Floridians I meet every day. Challenges like those we face today provide a valuable opportunity for us to make government better, more efficient and more accountable to the people we serve. The troubles in our economy are having a real effect on those people, who are looking for work and searching for hope. Businesses in my state and across the country are struggling to stay afloat. Families are tightening their belts. Government must tighten its belt, as well. Over the past two years in Florida, we have cut $7 billion in spending. Yet we have rightly maintained our commitment to our schools, to the most vulnerable among us and to our environment. I recently unveiled my $66.5 billion budget recommendation for next year, in which I propose using $4.7 billion in federal stimulus money. Without these funds, we would need to cut an additional $3.4 billion in programs. This money will help us avoid tax increases and prevent deep cuts that would further burden Florida's families and businesses. Florida will receive an estimated $12.2 billion in federal stimulus funds over three budget years. The package will provide tax credits, as well as immediate assistance in education, transportation, unemployment compensation and other aid. The stimulus money is expected to create 206,000 jobs in my state, jobs that the people of Florida need. Yes, we all need to be vigilant about keeping government as efficient and accountable as possible. But this stimulus is necessary in these trying times. -- Charlie Crist Republican governor of Florida"
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/10/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-wrong-about-sotomayor-unsigned-opinion/,"Ann Coulter Letter With the Supreme Courts decision in Ricci v. DeStefano this week, we can now report that Sonia Sotomayor is even crazier than Ruth Bader Ginsburg. To recap the famous Ricci case, in 2003, the city of New Haven threw out the results of a firefighters test  which had been expressly designed to be race-neutral  because only whites and Hispanics scored high enough to receive immediate promotions, whereas blacks who took the test did well enough only to be eligible for promotions down the line. Inasmuch as the high-scoring white and Hispanic firemen were denied promotions solely because of their race, they sued the city for race discrimination. Obamas Justice-designate Sotomayor threw out their lawsuit in a sneaky, unsigned opinion  the judicial equivalent of ""talk to the hand."" She upheld the citys race discrimination against white and Hispanic firemen on the grounds that the test had a ""disparate impact"" on blacks, meaning that it failed to promote some magical percentage of blacks. This strict quota regime was dressed up by the city  and by Sotomayors opinion  as a reasonable reaction to the threat of lawsuits by blacks who were not promoted. Thats a complicated way of saying: Racial quotas are peachy. According to Sotomayor, any test that gets the numbers wrong  whatever ""wrong"" means in any given context of professions, populations, applicants, workers, etc.  is grounds for a lawsuit, which in turn, is grounds for an employer to engage in race discrimination against disfavored racial groups, such as white men. Consequently, the only legal avenue available to employers under Sotomayors ruling is always to impose strict racial quotas in making hiring and promotion decisions. Say, if the threat of a lawsuit permits the government to ignore the Constitution, can pro-lifers get New Haven to shut down all abortion clinics by threatening to sue them? Theres no question but that abortion clinics have a ""disparate impact"" on black babies. This week, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 for the white and Hispanic firefighters, overturning Sotomayors endorsement of racial quotas. But all nine justices rejected Sotomayors holding that different test results alone give the government a green light to engage in race discrimination. Even Justice Ginsburgs opinion for the dissent clearly stated that ""an employer could not cast aside a selection method based on a statistical disparity alone."" Indeed, the dissenters argued that the case should be returned to the lower courts to look for some hidden racial bias in the test. For Sotomayor, the results alone proved racial bias. The one advantage Sotomayors talk-to-the-hand opinion has over Justice Ginsburgs prolix dissent is that brevity prevented Sotomayor from having to explain why quotas arent quotas. That was left to Ginsburg. Liberals desperately want race quotas  as long as quotas never come to their offices. But they cant say that, so instead they talk in circles for 10 hours straight, until everyone else is exhausted, and then, when no one is paying attention, they announce: So were all agreed  we will have racial quotas. Based on her lifetime of experience working as a firefighter, Ginsburg said: ""Relying heavily on written tests to select fire officers is a questionable practice, to say the least."" Liberals prefer a more objective test, such as race. Isnt excelling on written tests how Ruth Bader Ginsburg got where she is? Its curious how people whose entire careers are based on doing well on tests find them so irrelevant to other peoples jobs. In the middle of a fire, it can either be a great idea or the worst possible idea to open a door. An excellent method for finding out if your next fire chief knows the correct answer is a written test. Unleashing the canard of all race-obsessed liberals, Ginsburg observed that courts have found that a fire officers job ""involves complex behaviors, good interpersonal skills, the ability to make decisions under tremendous pressure, and a host of other abilities  none of which is easily measured by a written, multiple choice test."" So does a lawyers job. And yet attorneys with absolutely no ""interpersonal skills"" get cushy jobs and extravagant salaries on the basis of their commendable performance on all manner of written tests, from multiple choice LSATs and bar exams to written law school exams. I note that Ginsburg has not shown any particular interest in rectifying the ""disparate impact"" of legal exams: She never hired a single black law clerk out of the dozens she employed in more than a decade as an appeals court judge. (Her hiring practices on the Supreme Court are a state secret, but I can state with supreme certainty that her clerks do not reflect the racial mix of Washington, D.C.) But liberals think other peoples jobs are a joke, so the testing must also be a joke. That is  other than their preferred test: ""Is the applicant black, female or otherwise handicapped?"" There is no test that can prove all things about an employee and so there is no test that cant be derided by the race-mongers. Which is exactly the point. Get rid of all tests  except for lawyers who graduated at the top of their law school classes at Columbia, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Then liberals are free to impose racial quotas on other peoples jobs without limit. As crazy as this is, even Ginsburg and the other dissenters made a big point of pretending there was some flaw in this particular test. None adopted Sotomayors position that unequal test results alone prove discrimination. This suggests that a wise Jewish lady, due to the richness of her life experiences, might come to a better judgment than a Latina judge would. COPYRIGHT 2009 ANN COULTER"
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/22/ibdeditorialscom/private-health-insurance-page-16-house-bill/,"When we first saw the paragraph Tuesday, just after the 1,018-page document was released, we thought we surely must be misreading it. So we sought help from the House Ways and Means Committee.

It turns out we were right: The provision would indeed outlaw individual private coverage. Under the Orwellian header of ""Protecting The Choice To Keep Current Coverage,"" the ""Limitation On New Enrollment"" section of the bill clearly states:

""Except as provided in this paragraph, the individual health insurance issuer offering such coverage does not enroll any individual in such coverage if the first effective date of coverage is on or after the first day"" of the year the legislation becomes law.

So we can all keep our coverage, just as promised — with, of course, exceptions: Those who currently have private individual coverage won't be able to change it. Nor will those who leave a company to work for themselves be free to buy individual plans from private carriers.

From the beginning, opponents of the public option plan have warned that if the government gets into the business of offering subsidized health insurance coverage, the private insurance market will wither. Drawn by a public option that will be 30% to 40% cheaper than their current premiums because taxpayers will be funding it, employers will gladly scrap their private plans and go with Washington's coverage.

The nonpartisan Lewin Group estimated in April that 120 million or more Americans could lose their group coverage at work and end up in such a program. That would leave private carriers with 50 million or fewer customers. This could cause the market to, as Lewin Vice President John Sheils put it, ""fizzle out altogether.""

What wasn't known until now is that the bill itself will kill the market for private individual coverage by not letting any new policies be written after the public option becomes law.

The legislation is also likely to finish off health savings accounts, a goal that Democrats have had for years. They want to crush that alternative because nothing gives individuals more control over their medical care, and the government less, than HSAs.

With HSAs out of the way, a key obstacle to the left's expansion of the welfare state will be removed.

The public option won't be an option for many, but rather a mandate for buying government care. A free people should be outraged at this advance of soft tyranny.

Washington does not have the constitutional or moral authority to outlaw private markets in which parties voluntarily participate. It shouldn't be killing business opportunities, or limiting choices, or legislating major changes in Americans' lives.

It took just 16 pages of reading to find this naked attempt by the political powers to increase their reach. It's scary to think how many more breaches of liberty we'll come across in the final 1,002."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/19/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-criticizes-obama-muslim-history/,"Ann Coulter Letter Well, Im glad thats over! Now that our silver-tongued president has gone to Cairo to soothe Muslims hurt feelings, they love us again! Muslims in Pakistan expressed their appreciation for President Barack Obamas speech by bombing a fancy hotel in Peshawar this week. Operating on the liberal premise that what Arabs really respect is weakness, Obama listed, incorrectly, Muslims historical contributions to mankind, such as algebra (actually that was the ancient Babylonians), the compass (that was the Chinese), pens (the Chinese again) and medical discoveries (huh?). But why be picky? All these inventions came in mighty handy on Sept. 11, 2001! Thanks, Muslims!! Obama bravely told the Cairo audience that 9/11 was a very nasty thing for Muslims to do to us, but on the other hand, they are victims of colonization. Except we didnt colonize them. The French and the British did. So why are Arabs flying planes into our buildings and not the Arc de Triomphe? (And gosh, havent the Arabs done a lot with the Middle East since the French and the British left!) In another sharks-to-kittens comparison, Obama said, ""Now let me be clear, issues of womens equality are by no means simply an issue for Islam."" No, he said, ""the struggle for womens equality continues in many aspects of American life."" So on one hand, 12-year-old girls are stoned to death for the crime of being raped in Muslim countries. But on the other hand, we still dont have enough female firefighters here in America. Delusionally, Obama bragged about his multiculti worldview, saying, ""I reject the view of some in the West that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehow less equal."" In Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan and other Muslim countries, women ""choose"" to cover their heads on pain of losing them. Obama rolled out the crucial liberal talking point against Americas invasion of Iraq, saying Iraq was a ""war of convenience,"" while Afghanistan was a ""war of necessity."" Liberals cling to this nonsense doggerel as a shield against their hypocrisy on Iraq. Either both wars were wars of necessity or both wars were wars of choice. Neither Iraq nor Afghanistan  nor any country  attacked us on 9/11. Both Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as many other Muslim countries, were sheltering those associated with the terrorists who did attack us on 9/11  and who hoped to attack us again. The truth is, all wars are wars of choice, including the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, both World Wars, the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the Gulf War, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. OK, maybe the war on teen obesity is a war of convenience, but thats the only one I can think of. The modern Democrat Party chooses  really chooses, not like Saudi women ""choosing"" to wear hijabs  to fight no wars. But the Democrats couldnt say that immediately after 9/11, so they pretended to support the war in Afghanistan and then had to spend the next 7 1/2 years trying to come up with a distinction between Afghanistan and Iraq. Maybe next they can tell us why fighting Hitler  who never invaded the U.S. and had no plans to do so  was a ""necessity"" in a way that fighting Saddam wasnt. (Obama on Hitler: ""Nazi ideology sought to subjugate, humiliate and exterminate. It perpetrated murder on a massive scale."" Whereas Saddam Hussein was just messing with the Kuwaitis, Kurds and Shiites.) Meanwhile, Muslims throughout the Middle East are yearning for their own Saddam Husseins to be taken out by U.S. invaders so they can be liberated, too. (Then well see how many women  outside of an American college campus  ""choose"" to wear hijabs.) The war-of-choice/war-of-necessity point must be as mystifying to a Muslim audience as a discussion of gay marriage. Arabs arent afraid of us; theyre afraid of Iran. But our aspiring Jimmy Carter had no tough words for Iran. To the contrary, in Cairo, Obama endorsed Irans quest for nuclear ""power,"" while attacking  brace yourself  America for helping remove Iranian loon Mohammad Mossadegh. The CIAs taking out Mossadegh was probably the greatest thing that agency ever did. This was back in 1953, before it became a collection of lawyers and paper-pushers. Mossadegh was as crazy as a March hare (which is really saying something when your competition is Moammar Gadhafi, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and Saddam Hussein). He gave interviews lying in bed in pink pajamas. He wept, he fainted, and he set his nation on a path of permanent impoverishment by ""nationalizing"" the oil wells, where they sat idle after the British companies that knew how to operate them pulled out. But he was earthy and hated the British, so left-wing academics adored Mossadegh. The New York Times compared him to Thomas Jefferson. True, Mossadegh had been ""elected"" by the Iranian parliament  but only in the chaos following the assassination of the sitting prime minister. In short order, the shah dismissed this clown, but Mossadegh refused to step down, so the CIA forcibly removed him and allowed the shahs choice to assume the office. This ""coup,"" as liberal academics term it, was approved by liberals favorite Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower, and supported by such ponderous liberal blowhards as John Foster Dulles. For Obama to be apologizing for one of the CIAs greatest accomplishments isnt just crazy, its Ramsey Clark crazy. Obama also said that it was unfair that ""some countries have weapons that others do not"" and proclaimed that ""any nation  including Iran  should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."" Wait  how about us? If a fanatical holocaust denier with messianic delusions can have nuclear power, cant the U.S. at least build one nuclear power plant every 30 years? Im sure Irans compliance will be policed as well as North Koreas was. Clinton struck a much-heralded ""peace deal"" with North Korea in 1994, giving them $4 billion to construct nuclear facilities and 500,000 tons of fuel oil in return for a promise that they wouldnt build nuclear weapons. The ink wasnt dry before the North Koreans began feverishly building nukes. But back to Iran, what precisely do Iranians need nuclear power for, again? Theyre not exactly a manufacturing powerhouse. Iran is a primitive nation in the middle of a desert that happens to sit on top of a large percentage of the worlds oil and gas reserves. Thats not enough oil and gas to run household fans? Obamas ""Im OK, Youre OK"" speech would be hilarious, if it werent so terrifying."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/24/jeff-miller/recovery-gov-assigns-statewide-education-jobs-one/,"For weeks, President Obama has told us that his $787 billion “stimulus” package has saved or created over a million jobs.  As proof, the Administration’s website Recovery.gov gave us the chance to look at the numbers. 

So this week I looked through the President’s job claims.  I learned that 52 jobs were saved or created in the 34th Congressional District of Florida.  5 jobs created in the 86th District.  46 in District 00.  And although $460,000 of your tax dollars were spent in the 53rd District, unfortunately zero jobs were saved.

The problem is, these congressional districts do not exist. 

Florida only has TWENTY-FIVE congressional districts. 

In fact, according to Recovery.gov, over $11 million has been spent in Florida in districts that just aren’t there. 

How can the President and Majority Party in Congress expect us to believe their dubious jobs-created claims when their own numbers are patently false?  How can we trust the Administration to run the stimulus when they can’t even properly manage their own website?

Even the Obama Administration is perplexed.  The chief federal oversight official for the stimulus program, Recovery Board Chairman Earl Devaney, confirms that it is impossible to certify that the President’s job claims are accurate or auditable.  Ed Pound, the communications director for the Recovery.gov website, said he had no idea how these fake congressional districts received stimulus money.  When asked by the New Orleans Times Picayune why recipients would plug-in phantom districts, Pound responded, “who knows, man, who really knows?”

I would say to Mr. Pound that the American people know.  We know that the Administration is pulling a “jobs created or saved” number out of thin air despite the fact that the unemployment rate remains high.  The people of Florida know.  We know that although Democrats represent only 10 of Florida’s 25 districts, their districts received 60% of the stimulus funds. 

These numbers reek of partisanship and potential corruption. 

Instead of spending trillions of taxpayer dollars on programs that do not and will not create jobs, the President should focus on cutting taxes on small businesses and supporting an American economy that will create and sustain jobs.  Republicans have a plan that will do just that.

We have waited and waited and waited for the shifty Baucus to release legislative language. But he has refused to release anything but a summary -- and we will never have a Congressional Budget Office cost assessment based on actual legislation. Even the summary was kept secret for a long time.But, on the basis of the summary, the Baucus bill (which is still unnumbered) tells us virtually nothing about what kind of policy Americans will be required to purchase under penalty of law -- nor the consequences. It simply says:* all U.S. citizens and legal residents would be required to purchase coverage through (1) the individual market...;* individuals would be required to report on their federal income tax return the months for which they maintain the required minimum health coverage...;* in addition to an extensive list of statutorily mandated coverage, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius would be empowered to define and update the categories of treatments, items, and services... within an insurance plan which would be covered in a policy constituting required minimum health coverage.It is nearly certain that coverage prescribed by the administration will, to control costs, exclude coverage for what it regards as excessively dangerous activities. And, given Sebelius well-established antipathy to the Second Amendment -- she vetoed concealed carry legislation as governor of Kansas -- we presume she will define these dangerous activities to include hunting and self-defense using a firearm. It is even possible that the Obama-prescribed policy could preclude reimbursement of any kind in a household which keeps a loaded firearm for self-defense.The ObamaCare bill already contains language that will punish Americans who engage in unhealthy behavior by allowing insurers to charge them higher insurance premiums. (What constitutes an unhealthy lifestyle is, of course, to be defined by legislators.) Dont be surprised if an anti-gun nut like Sebelius uses this line of thinking to impose ObamaCare policies which result in a back-door gun ban on any American who owns dangerous firearms.After all, insurers already (and routinely) drop homeowners from their policies for owning certain types of guns or for refusing to use trigger locks (that is, for keeping their guns ready for self-defense!). While not all insurers practice this anti-gun behavior, Gun Owners of America has documented that some do -- Prudential and State Farm being two of the most well-known.The good news is that because homeowner insurance is private (and is still subject to the free market) you can go to another company if one drops you. But what are you going to do under nationalized ObamaCare when the regulations written by Secretary Sebelius suspend the applicability of your government-mandated policy because of your gunownership of this is in addition to something that GOA has been warning you about for several months  the certainty that minimum acceptable policies will dump your gun information into a federal database  a certainty that is reinforced by language in the summary providing for a study to encourage increased meaningful use of electronic health records.Remember, the federal government has already denied more than 150,000 military veterans the right to own guns, without their being convicted of a crime or receiving any due process of law. They were denied because of medical information (such as PTSD) that the FBI later determined disqualified these veterans to own guns.Is this what we need on a national level being applied to every gun owner inAmerica, failure to comply would subject the average family to $1,500 in fines -- and possibly more for a household with older teens. And, although a Schumer amendment purports to exempt Americans from prison sentences for non-purchase of an ObamaPolicy -- something which was never at issue -- it doesnt prohibit them from being sent to prison for a year and fined an additional $25,000 under the Internal Revenue Code for non-payment of the initial fines.Contact your two U.S. Senators. Ask him or her, in the strongest terms, to vote against the phony Baucus bill.You can use the Gun Owners Legislative Action Center to send your senators the pre-written e-mail message below.Dear Senator:You already know that the phony Baucus bill:* Is predicated on $283 billion in phony cuts which have never, never ever been realized since a similar commitment to cut Medicare costs in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 -- and will never, never ever be realized under the Baucus bill;* Requires massive numbers of Americans to have government-approved insurance which the CBO predicts will be more expensive than current policies;* Refuses to provide a cost for these policies, making it almost certain that more and more Americans will find insurance beyond their reach;* Has no legislative language and nothing but a CBO guesstimate of the cost and benefits, based on a summary.On the basis of the summary, the Baucus bill tells us virtually nothing about what kind of policy Americans will be required to purchase under penalty of law -- nor the consequences. It does say that the Secretary of HHS [Kathleen Sebelius] would be required to define and update the categories of treatments, items, and services... within an insurance plan which would be covered in a policy constituting required minimum health coverage.This could spell trouble for gun owners.It is nearly certain that coverage prescribed by the administration will, to control costs, exclude coverage for what it regards as excessively dangerous activities.

President Barack Obama's college record has officially been under strict secrecy since his run for the White House began in 2007. This record includes two years at Occidental College in Los Angeles, two years at Columbia University, and finally at Harvard Law School.

-- Please donate to Soldiers' Angels--

During his time at these colleges, Obama gained notoriety for being an especially bright and hardworking student. At Harvard, he was later elected as the editor of the Harvard Law Review, which many observers see as the beginning of his political career.

However, many things regarding the future President's time at these colleges have remained private. Under order of the Obama campaign, all information not directly allowed published by Obama himself, is not to be disclosed to any media. These included grades, attendance records, rewards received, and papers submitted.

With all of the secrecy regarding the President's academic record, famed Time reporter Joe Klein looked into the records for an upcoming special edition about the President. Klein included several key points in the piece, including his grades and stellar letters of recommendation. However, what has leaked along with this information was the subject of a thesis written by the young Obama while still an undergraduate at Columbia.

A political science major, Obama was seen as a top student, according to his classmates. Professors even asked the young student to lecture several times. Obama was required to write a 'senior seminar' paper in order to graduate from Columbia. The subject of this paper, which totaled 44 pages, was American government. Entitled Aristocracy Reborn, this paper chronicled the long struggle of the working class against, as Obama put it, ""plutocratic thugs with one hand on the money and the other on the government.""

In the paper, in which only the first ten pages were given to the general media, Obama decries the plight of the poor: ""I see poverty in every place I walk. In Los Angeles and New York, the poor reach to me with bleary eyes and all I can do is sigh.""

In part, the future President blames this on the current economic system: ""There are many who will defend the 'free market.' But who will defend the single mother of four working three jobs. When a system is allowed to be free at the expense of its citizens, then it is tyranny.""

However, the President also singled out the American Constitution: ""... the Constitution allows for many things, but what it does not allow is the most revealing. The so-called Founders did not allow for economic freedom. While political freedom is supposedly a cornerstone of the document, the distribution of wealth is not even mentioned. While many believed that the new Constitution gave them liberty, it instead fitted them with the shackles of hypocrisy.""

It is yet unknown if more of this thesis will be released. It was also noted that the President received an A- for the paper, which later led to his graduation.

Bush famously received an intelligence briefing entitled, ""Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S."" Thirty-six days later, al Qaeda terrorists did just that. Scientists tell us we have a 10-year window -- if even that -- before catastrophic climate change becomes inevitable and irreversible. The threat is real, and time is not on our side. Facts, as John Adams said, are stubborn things. Here are a few you need to know: Atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels have risen 38% in the industrial era, from 280 to 385 parts per million (ppm). Scientists have warned that anything above 450 ppm -- a warming of 2 degrees Celsius -- will result in an unacceptable risk of catastrophic climate change. The truth is that the threat we face is not an abstract concern for the future. It is already upon us and its effects are being felt worldwide, right now. Scientists project that the Arctic will be ice-free in the summer of 2013. Not in 2050, but four years from now. Make no mistake: catastrophic climate change represents a threat to human security, global stability, and -- yes -- even to American national security. Climate change injects a major new source of chaos, tension, and human insecurity into an already volatile world. It threatens to bring more famine and drought, worse pandemics, more natural disasters, more resource scarcity, and human displacement on a staggering scale. We risk fanning the flames of failed-statism, and offering glaring opportunities to the worst actors in our international system. In an interconnected world, that endangers all of us. The individual data points may sometimes be murky. But the pattern they create is irrefutably clear: We don't know if Hurricane Katrina was caused by climate change, but we do know that we are rapidly heading for a world where climate change causes worse Katrinas. We don't know with certainty whether climate change pushed Darfur over the edge, but we do know that it will cause more tension just like we've seen in Darfur. Once you accept the science, it's clear that such massive environmental change will create dislocation, destruction, chaos, and conflict. And history teaches us that we are deluding ourselves if we think that we are insulated from world events. The people of the tiny coastal village of Newtok, Alaska offer a harbinger of the challenges ahead. Citizens there recently voted to move their village nine miles inland because melting ice shelves made their old home too dangerous. But don't take my word for it. Anyone who doubts the reality of climate change should go to Alaska and see the melting permafrost for themselves, or listen to the state's two U.S. senators tell worrisome stories about climate change's current -- not future -- impact on their state. Anyone who doubts the threat should talk to the 11 retired American admirals and generals who warned in 2007 that ""Climate change can act as a threat multiplier for instability in some of the most volatile regions of the world, and it presents significant national-security challenges for the United States."" You can even ask the security planners in the Bush Administration, whose final national-defense strategy document recognized climate change among key trends that will shape U.S. defense policy in the coming years. Or ask the National Intelligence Council -- the U.S. intelligence community's think-tank -- which has concluded that ""global climate change will have wide-ranging implications for U.S. national-security interests over the next 20 years."" Former CENTCOM Commander Anthony Zinni, no radical tree-hugger, put it simply: ""We will pay for this one way or another. We will pay to reduce greenhouse gas emissions today, and we'll have to take an economic hit of some kind. Or, we will pay the price later in military terms. And that will involve human lives. There will be a human toll."" Nowhere is the connection between climate and security more direct than in South Asia -- home to al Qaeda. Scientists now warn that the Himalayan glaciers which supply fresh water to a billion people in the region could disappear completely by 2035. Think about what this means: Water from the Himalayans flows through India and Pakistan. India's rivers are not only vital to its agriculture but are also critical to its religious practice. Pakistan, for its part, is heavily dependent on irrigated farming to avoid famine. At a moment when the U.S. government is scrambling to ratchet down tensions and preparing to invest billions of dollars to strengthen Pakistan's capacity to deliver for its people -- climate change could work so powerfully in the opposite direction. Worldwide, climate change risks making the most volatile places even more combustible. The bottom line is that failure to tackle climate change risks much more than a ravaged environment: It risks a much more dangerous world, and a gravely threatened America. Unfortunately, not everyone in Washington appreciates the stakes. It's tragic that we live at a time when if one were to dismiss the threat of terrorism, you'd be sent home in the next election. But there are no similar political consequences if you dismiss the science or the threat of climate change. This winter, delegates from 192 nations will gather in Copenhagen to create a new global climate treaty. Between now and then, the United States Congress is expected to act on climate legislation. The decisions we make in coming months will determine whether we meet this challenge head-on and prevail or if we are to suffer the worst consequences of a warming planet. This time we have to connect the dots before we face catastrophe."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/03/ibdeditorialscom/ibd-editorial-board-claims-cap-and-trade-unpopular/,"Global Warming: Given rising voter anger, members of the U.S. Senate can't be blamed for going wobbly on costly cap-and-trade legislation. But maybe members of the EU Parliament can buck them up. Let's hope not.

Not satisfied just with ruining their own continent's economy, a few Euro-pols want to come over here and do us the same favor.

The Waxman-Markey version of cap-and-trade already passed the House in June on a narrow 219-212 vote. Now these members of the European Parliament want to lend support as their green-left comrades in the U.S. Senate ponder doing the same.

With China and India saying they won't take part in this green nonsense, the Euro-socialists' only hope is to get a foolish U.S. to pass an economically ruinous cap-and-trade bill by 2012. That's when the failed Kyoto Protocol to curb greenhouse gases expires.

""We have had signals from the Senate that it would be useful to send a delegation from the European Parliament before they take a decision,"" said Jo Leinen, the Euro-Parliament's top green official.

""Useful""? Memo to Congress and the Euro-pols: Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans. No matter how many suave European continentals you send here, it won't change voters' minds.

Yet, as long as they're here, we hope they'll submit to a town hall meeting or two to answer a few pointed questions, such as:

• Why did CO2 emissions actually increase by 0.8% in Europe after the first phase of their plan began in 2005?

• Why did European officials create more carbon permits than CO2 emissions, thereby causing the price of carbon to collapse?

• What should American politicians tell their tax-wary constituents, given that 56% in a recent Rasmussen poll said they wouldn't pay one penny more in taxes to cut greenhouse gases?

While they're at it, they should also address the growing number of studies that show cap-and trade would be an economic disaster.

A recent Heritage Foundation study found that the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill would cost the average family of four $4,609 a year and reduce overall GDP by $9.4 trillion by 2035. Some 2.5 million jobs will disappear over the same time.

Similarly, a George C. Marshall Institute review of a number of studies found similar high costs and huge job losses, on average. Taxes, for instance, would rise $2,000 by 2030. Food costs would go up $2,500 a year. Energy prices would grow 145%.

Such economic losses are intolerable. The Euro-pols are, of course, always welcome here. We can use their tourist euros. But they might want to watch some Tea Party YouTubes before they come over and start pushing Euro-style taxes on Americans."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/18/lamar-alexander/alexander-claims-cap-and-trade-will-cost-consumer-/,"September 16th, 2009 - Washington - U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, today released the below statement on internal Treasury Department documents prepared for the Obama administration. The documents detail the nearly 15-percent income-tax increase and 1-percent reduction in economic growth that would result from the administration’s proposed cap-and-trade legislation.

“The current administration claims to be the most transparent in American history, yet it’s been hiding a report showing its cap-and-trade energy plan would cost up to $200 billion every year. American families can’t afford a new $1,761 yearly energy tax, and our economy surely cannot afford the 1-percent drop in productivity this big-government bill would cause,” Alexander said. “The best step we can take right now to lower energy costs, boost the economy, and clean our air would be to rely on a technology we created: nuclear power.”

The documents were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request made by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and can be found at http://www.openmarket.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/FOIA-Cap-andTrade-2009-09-11.PDF."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/21/national-right-life-committee/national-right-life-committee-claims-under-Baucus-/,"At first blush, the health care plan released today by Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus seems to shift somewhat in a pro-life direction. Whether it will be enough to satisfy pro-life groups -- especially the Catholic Bishops -- remains to be seen but it is more pro-life than the House bill in the following ways:

The House bill had a public option. This doesn't. Much of the pro-life anger at the House bill revolved around the possibility that the public option would cover abortion. Baucus eliminates that possibility.

Both bills would subsidize those who couldn't get private health insurance, but they use different mechanisms, and that may make a difference. In the House bill, the federal government writes a check to a health insurance company. In the Senate bill, the federal government provides a tax benefit to an individual, who then chooses what kind of private insurance to buy. It's quite similar to the approach proposed by John McCain during the 2008 plan. Money might still bounce from the feds to an abortion provider but it's much more indirect.

Baucus then used some bookkeeping tools to further limit the possibility of federal money going to abortion, but it's the same language (albeit in a different context) that was mocked by pro-life groups when included in the House bill.

I was surprised Baucus included the House provision requiring that each insurance exchange include a private plan that covers abortion and one that doesn't. The author of that House amendment thought it was quintessentially even-handed but pro-life groups disliked it because it meant that some areas that might not have any plans covering abortion would now have to have some. (I dont know whether there are states like that).

I'll post reaction from the groups as I get it.

The ""America's Healthy Future Act,"" proposed today by Senator Max Baucus (D-Mt.), contains an array of pro-abortion mandates and federal subsidies for elective abortion. National Right to Life strongly opposes the legislation in its current form. We will work in support of amendments to eliminate the abortion mandates and federal abortion subsidies.




The bill contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion. This would be a drastic break from longstanding federal policy, under which federal funds do not pay for elective abortions or subsidize health plans that cover elective abortions. For example, current law prohibits any of the over 250 private health plans that participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program from paying for elective abortions, because these plans receive federal subsidies. These private plans cover over 8 million federal employees and dependents, including members of Congress.


Thus, under the Baucus bill, like the House Democratic leadership bill (H.R. 3200), federal funds would subsidize coverage of elective abortions. In addition, the Baucus bill requires that a specific charge must be included in the premiums paid by those who enroll in such subsidized plans, of at least ""$1 per enrollee, per month,"" which amounts to a surcharge specifically for elective abortions.


These bills are not consistent with President Obama's September 9 claim that ""no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions,"" or with Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius's September 13 affirmation that ""no public funds would go to fund abortions."" Funds spent by federal agencies are, by law, federal funds. The claim that under these bills, a federal agency would use ""private funds"" to subsidize abortions is absurd on its face -- a political hoax.


In addition, the Baucus bill provides $6 billion in federal funds for the establishment of health insurance cooperatives, without any limitation on the use of these funds to pay for abortions or to subsidize plans that pay for elective abortions.


In addition, the Baucus bill contains language that would allow the federal government to declare abortion to be a ""mandated benefit as part of a minimum benefits package"" in any circumstances in which the federal Medicaid program could pay for an abortion. Currently, the federal Medicaid program pays for abortion only in three limited circumstances: to save the life of the mother, or in cases of rape or incest. But that limitation depends on language, the Hyde Amendment, that expires every September 30, and that must be renewed annually as part of the Health and Human Services appropriations bill. Under the Baucus language, if one house of Congress, and/or the President, blocked renewal of the Hyde Amendment, many private insurance plans could be forced to include abortion on demand as a mandatory benefit in the minimum benefits package. This would be another major departure from the status quo. (Currently, only 13 percent of all abortions are billed directly to private insurance, according to the Guttmacher Institute.)"

 - Former AARP Executive Marilyn Moon, quoted in Bloomberg article

This week the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced it was investigating Humana for providing ""misleading"" information regarding the Administration's proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage policies-and prohibited other Medicare Advantage plans from providing similar information on how Democrat health ""reform"" could take away their current coverage.
 
Yet the Administration's edict prohibiting plans from communicating with their beneficiaries failed to include AARP, which sponsors a Medicare Advantage plan but has been a prime advocate of Democrats' government takeover of health care-quite possibly because AARP has been supporting a health care overhaul from which it stands to gain overall handsomely.  Even as AARP advocates for cutting Medicare Advantage plans by more than $150 billion, an analysis of the organization's operations reveals that it stands to receive tens of millions of dollars at the expense of seniors' medical care-with Democrats' full approval:

 The Congressional Budget Office has previously estimated that the cuts to Medicare Advantage plans proposed in Democrats' government takeover of health care (H.R. 3200) would cause millions of seniors to lose their current plan and enroll in government-run Medicare.
 Because the government-run Medicare benefit is less generous than most private health plans, the independent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found in June that more than nine in ten seniors not in nursing home settings utilize some form of Medicare supplemental insurance.  While many of these individuals currently rely on Medicare Advantage plans for the extra benefits they provide to seniors, many would be forced to purchase supplemental Medigap policies should their existing Medicare Advantage plans be taken away from them due to Democrats' government takeover of health care.
 A review of its financial statements finds that in 2008, AARP received more than half a billion dollars in revenue from selling products like Medigap supplemental insurance policies-$652.7 million in direct ""royalties and fees,"" and an increase of more than 31 percent from the $497.6 million in similar revenue AARP generated in 2007.
Royalty revenues now comprise more than half-60.3 percent-of all AARP revenues; a Bloomberg news analysis published in December found that in 1999, royalties comprised only 11 percent of the organization's total revenues.
 The Bloomberg article-which highlighted what one observer called AARP's ""dirty little secret""-profiled seniors who felt betrayed after paying hundreds of dollars above market price for AARP-branded coverage.  One noted that ""AARP has great buying power, and people should be able to get the best deal....This is unconscionable, what AARP has allowed to happen.""  Another disillusioned senior wrote to the organization's leadership asking whether AARP had a ""‘special relationship' with [insurance carriers] by which it receives commissions, incentives, rebates, or dare I say ‘kickbacks?'""-and when he arrived at AARP headquarters for a tour, was promptly escorted out of the marble-covered atrium.
 While H.R. 3200 would place strict price controls on Medicare Advantage plans-requiring them to pay out 85 percent of premium revenues in medical claims-Medigap policies face a far less strict 65 percent requirement.  In other words, under the Democrat bill, seniors could pay as much as 20 cents more out of every premium dollar to fund ""kickbacks"" to AARP-sponsored Medigap plans than Medicare Advantage plans.
 
The higher prices charged by AARP plans, and the organization's increasing dependence upon revenue from ""royalties,"" provide tangible evidence why AARP would support cuts to Medicare Advantage that would likely increase their ""kickbacks"" from Medigap plans.  However, it does not answer several key questions:

Given the myriad new layers of insurance regulation included in Democrats' government takeover of health care, why does the legislation not include a single provision attempting to impose any new restrictions on Medigap policies?
Did Democrats ""forget"" to protect seniors-or were they informed that AARP could not support legislation that would limit its lucrative revenue source?
Similarly, did CMS ""forget"" to include AARP among the organizations whose First Amendment rights to inform seniors of harmful Medicare provisions were restricted-or did the Administration only wish to silence its critics, and not outside organizations using ""kickbacks"" to fund advertising in support of the Democrat agenda?
These questions hint at a more fundamental query: With seniors believing that AARP is ""making money on the backs of old people,"" who should believe that the organization is looking out for seniors' interests and not its own?"
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/07/patrick-mchenry/rep-patrick-mchenry-claims-early-census-returns-ar/,"Im worried about this years census. Im not worried about ACORN rigging the count  we already succeeded in kicking them out of the census. Im not worried about the Presidents attempt to run the census out of the White House  we beat that power grab back last year. Im not even worried about privacy  this years 10-question census form is the shortest in memory. No, what worries me is blatant misinformation coming from otherwise well-meaning conservatives. They are trying to do the right thing, but instead they are helping big government liberals by discouraging fellow conservatives from filling out their census forms. Early census returns are showing that conservatives have been measurably less likely than liberals to return their census forms. A recent article in the Houston Chronicle points out that conservative Texas is way behind the national average in returning census forms and some of the lowest rates are in Texas most conservative counties. [Update: Since the Houston Chronicle article was published, the average national census participation rate has increased to 52 percent and the rates in each of the counties mentioned in the article have increased to the following, still very low, rates: King County, 25 percent; Briscoe County, 33 percent; Culberson County, 22 percent; Newton County, 30 percent.] Few things make will make Nancy Pelosi happier than large numbers of conservatives failing to respond to the census. If we do not respond, we will not be counted and if we are not counted, then we effectively will not exist. That would reduce conservatives power in elections, allow Democrats to draw more favorable congressional boundaries and help put more tax-hiking politicians in office. Boycotting the census also offends me as an American patriot. Our society spends too much time talking about what government owes us; and not enough on the duties of citizenship and the hard work required to keep our freedom. Filling out the census is one of the few things our Constitution specifically asks of U.S. citizens and it is our duty as Americans to take that responsibility seriously. Anyone who tells you that this years census is unconstitutional and that you are not required to fill out the form completely is flat out wrong. They argue that because this years census asks for more than a simple count of how many people live in your home, it is unconstitutional and therefore should not be completely filled out. That argument doesnt stand up to either history or the Constitutions text. Lets take a look at the Constitutions wording on the census: The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. (Article I, Section 2, Clause 3) That last part, in such a manner as they shall by law direct, gives Congress the power to determine how the census will be conducted and what questions will be asked. A lot of what the federal government does relies on an utterly contorted reading of the Commerce Clause. Not the census. Writing census questions is one of the few things the Constitution explicitly gives Congress the power to do. History also makes clear that this argument is completely unfounded. Every census in U.S. history has asked for more information than a simple count. In fact, the most private question on this years form asks for an individuals race and that question has been asked by every census since the 1790 census conducted under then-President George Washington. To suggest that this question or others like it make this years census unconstitutional is absurd. No one has advocated a direct boycott of the census but there have been calls to only partially fill out census forms  even though that would be a direct violation of federal law. Those calls are the problem. They feed a climate of mistrust in the census and need to be refuted. Unless conservatives understand how important it is to participate in the census, that climate will result in fewer conservatives being counted and hand Nancy Pelosi more congressional seats. I and other conservatives have worked hard to fight off the Obama Administrations harmful census plans. We fought off their attempt to run the census directly. We fought off ACORNs attempt to participate and we fought off ill-conceived statistical sampling schemes that would artificially inflate the number of Democrat voters. We have been largely successful in keeping this count apolitical and it would be a tragedy if some of our ill-informed friends handed Democrats a victory at the last minute."

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/16/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-repeats-questionable-statistic-growth/,"When Americans think of organized labor, they might think of images like I saw growing up in a blue-collar meatpacking town: hard hats, work boots, tough conditions and gritty jobs. While I didn't work in the slaughterhouses, I did become a union member when I worked at a grocery store to help put myself through school. I was grateful for the paycheck and proud of the work I did. The rise of the labor movement in the early 20th century was a triumph for America's working class. In an era of deep economic anxiety, unions stood up for hard-working but vulnerable families, protecting them from physical and economic exploitation. David Crane, special economic advisor to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, breaks down the numbers. Much has changed. The majority of union members today no longer work in construction, manufacturing or ""strong back"" jobs. They work for government, which, thanks to President Obama, has become the only booming ""industry"" left in our economy. Since January 2008 the private sector has lost nearly eight million jobs while local, state and federal governments added 590,000. Federal employees receive an average of $123,049 annually in pay and benefits, twice the average of the private sector. And across the country, at every level of government, the pattern is the same: Unionized public employees are making more money, receiving more generous benefits, and enjoying greater job security than the working families forced to pay for it with ever-higher taxes, deficits and debt. How did this happen? Very quietly. The rise of government unions has been like a silent coup, an inside job engineered by self-interested politicians and fueled by campaign contributions. Public employee unions contribute mightily to the campaigns of liberal politicians ($91 million in the midterm elections alone) who vote to increase government pay and workers. As more government employees join the unions and pay dues, the union bosses pour ever more money and energy into liberal campaigns. The result is that certain states are now approaching default. Decades of overpromising and fiscal malpractice by state and local officials have created unfunded public employee benefit liabilities of more than $3 trillion. Images.com/Corbis Over the last eight years in Minnesota, we have taken decisive action to prevent our problems from becoming a state crisis. Public employee unions fought us virtually every step of the way. Mass transit employees, for example, went on strike for 44 days in 2005because we refused to grant them lifetime health-care benefits after working just 15 years. It was a tough fight, but in the end Minnesota taxpayers won. We reworked benefits for new hires. We required existing employees to contribute more to their pensions. We reformed our public employee health plan and froze wages. We proved that even in deep-blue Minnesota, taxpayers can take on big government and big labor, and win. In coming years, that fight will have to be joined throughout the country in city halls, state capitals and in Washington, D.C. Reformers would be wise to adopt three overriding principles. First, we need to bring public employee compensation back in line with the private sector and reduce the overall size of the federal civilian work force. Mr. Obama's proposal to freeze federal pay is a step in the right direction, but it falls well short of shrinking government and eliminating the pay premium enjoyed by federal employees. Second, get the numbers right. Government should start using the same established accounting standards that private businesses are required to use, so we can accurately assess unfunded liabilities. Third, we need to end defined-benefit retirement plans for government employees. Defined-benefit systems have created a financial albatross for taxpayers. The private sector dropped them years ago in favor of the clarity and predictability of defined-contribution models such as 401(k) plans. This change alone can save taxpayers trillions of dollars. The moral case for unionsprotecting working families from exploitationdoes not apply to public employment. Government employees today are among the most protected, well-paid employees in the country. Ironically, public-sector unions have become the exploiters, and working families once again need someone to stand up for them. If we're going to stop the government unions' silent coup, conservative reformers around the country must fight this challenge head on. The choice between big government and everyday Americans isn't a hard one. Mr. Pawlenty, a Republican, is governor of Minnesota."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/05/ron-paul/ron-paul-claims-money-supply-has-doubled/,"Much has been made recently about the supposed economic recovery. A few blips in a few statistics and many believe our troubles are all over. Of course, they have to redefine recovery as “jobless” to account for the lack of improvement on Main Street. But the banks have money, Wall Street is chugging along, and the administration would like to get on with other agendae.

They have even set up a commission to investigate the crisis as if it were all in the past.

The truth is that Americans are still losing jobs, the Fed is still inflating, and more regulations are in the works that will prevent jobs and productivity from coming back. We are on this trajectory for the long haul. The claim has been made many times that this administration has only had a year to clean up the mess of the last administration. I wish they would at least get started!Instead of reversing course, they are maintaining Bush’s policies full speed ahead. They are even keeping the Bush-appointee in charge of the Federal Reserve!They are not even making token efforts at change in economic policy. And for all the talk of transparency, we hear that some powerful senators will do all they can to block a simple audit of the powerful and secretive Federal Reserve.

We have been on a disastrous course for a long time. The money supply has doubled in the last year, our debt is unsustainable, the value of the dollar is going to continue its drop, and those Americans who understand where we are headed feel helpless and held hostage by foolish policy makers in Washington. When the bills finally come due and the dollar stops working we are in for some real social, economic and political chaos. That is, unless we take some major steps now to allow for a peaceful transition in the future. These steps are laid out in my legislation to legalize competing currencies.

First of all, no one should be compelled by law to operate in Federal Reserve notes if they prefer an alternative. We should repeal legal tender laws and allow Americans to conduct transactions in constitutional money. Only gold and silver can constitutionally be legal tender, not paper money. Instead, it is illegal to conduct business using gold and silver instead of Federal Reserve notes. Simply legalizing the Constitution should be a no-brainer to anyone who took an oath of office. Consequently, private mints should be allowed to mint gold and silver coins. They would be subject to fraud and counterfeit laws, of course, and people would be free to use their coins or stay with Federal Reserve notes, as they see fit. Finally, we should abolish taxes on gold and silver, which puts precious metals at a competitive disadvantage to paper money.

The Federal Reserve is a government-sanctioned banking cartel that has held far too much power for far too long and is in the end stages of running the dollar into the ground, and our economy along with it. The very least Congress can do, if they are not willing to abolish the Fed, and perhaps not even conduct a serious audit of it, is to allow citizens the freedom to defend themselves from being completely wiped out by their monopoly power."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/04/dana-milbank/milbank-says-americans-admire-glenn-beck-more-they/,"It's official: Americans admire Glenn Beck more than they admire the pope. This news, at once unsettling and unsurprising, came from the Gallup polling organization on Wednesday. Beck, the new Fox News host who has said President Obama has a ""deep-seated hatred for white people"" and alternately likens administration officials to Nazis and Marxists, was also more admired by Americans than Billy Graham and Bill Gates, not to mention Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. In Americans' esteem, Beck only narrowly trailed South Africa's Nelson Mandela, the man who defeated apartheid. The 45-year-old recovering alcoholic and Mormon convert has become the first true demagogue of the information age. His nightly diet of falsehoods and conspiracies on Fox, and his daily outrages on the radio, have propelled his popularity past even Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. His method is simple: He goes places where others are forbidden by conscience. Death panels? Government health insurance for dogs? FEMA concentration camps? An Obama ""civilian national security force"" like Hitler's SS or Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard? An administration official advocating forced abortions and sterilization agents in drinking water? Beck trafficked in them all in 2009. He also proposed on his radio show that people should read Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"" to prepare for Obama's health-care plan -- and that's in addition to the 28 times the Fuhrer made an appearance on Beck's Fox show in 2009. The Anti-Defamation League identified the secret to Beck's success when it noted that he, unlike other prominent right-wing talkers, was willing ""to give a platform to the conspiracy theorists and anti-government extremists."" His critics during his ascent over the year have compared the pudgy Fox News host to Father Coughlin, George Wallace and Joe McCarthy. Time magazine put Beck on its cover and asked: ""Is Glenn Beck Bad for America?"" A better question might be: ""Is Glenn Beck America?"" All ages have their charlatans. The fact that Beck's stew of venom and fabrication has been such a triumph probably says less about Beck than about us. He has merely captured the moment. There's scant evidence that Beck holds his zany views with any conviction -- even if he often breaks into tears on the air to demonstrate his passion. At the very least, he has come to his views recently, after years as a morning-zoo radio DJ with libertarian leanings. The Atlantic's James Warren reported that the comedian Stephen Colbert recently spoke about the difficulty of lampooning Beck, reasoning that ""if somebody doesn't believe what they're saying, it's very hard to out-stupid them."" But if Beck isn't a true believer, he's a brilliant entertainer, and he has calculated, correctly, that a large number of Americans would turn on cable news for more of the insults and conspiracies they get online. In terms of the political culture, he's more parasite than host. Yet, by any measure, he's had a huge impact on the body politic. -- Viewers: The former DJ is getting nearly 3 million a night, sometimes besting even O'Reilly among the viewers most valuable to advertisers, even though there are far fewer people watching TV during Beck's 5 p.m. slot than during prime time. -- Cultural impact: At the New York Times, where Beck's frequent books often top the bestseller list, Motoko Rich reports that novelists are calling Beck the ""new Oprah,"" and some entertainment industry executives consider him a possible replacement for Oprah herself. -- Scalps: He single-handedly brought down Obama adviser Van Jones over the official's far-left past. -- Followers: He launched the 9.12 Project, which held a large protest in Washington, was a major promoter of the Tea Party movement and is planning conventions and rallies in 2010. In a hearing on ""policy czars"" by the Senate Homeland Security committee this fall, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) declared that Beck had forced them to hold the hearing. ""This all began from a rant by He Who Shall Not Be Named,"" she said. The chairman, Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) insisted the topic had come up before ""it got to be a hot topic on the airwaves, particularly from He Whose Name Shall Not Be Mentioned, who is my constituent and longtime acquaintance, since he had a morning radio show in New Haven, Connecticut."" Lieberman didn't mention that he wrote a letter of recommendation that helped get the high-school-educated Beck into a non-degree program at Yale. Beck quit after just one course in religion -- and now this theology dropout has earned a status in America more exalted than the Holy Father's. As Glenn Beck likes to say: I fear for my country. _EMAIL_"
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/23/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-blames-obama-administration-not-pursu/,"According to NAACP President Ben Jealous, the tea party is chock full of racist people bent on harming African-Americans. Speaking at the organization's annual convention this week, Jealous let loose on the tea folks: ""Here comes the genetic descendant of the White Citizens Council, burst from its coffin, carrying signs and slogans like 'Lynch Barack Hussein Obama'...""

An exhaustive search of media reportage on the tea parties turns up no mention of signs like that. And even if they existed, is it fair to demonize an entire movement because a few nuts are associated with it?

Does the NAACP want to be evaluated on that basis?

From the beginning of its ascent, the tea party has been targeted by the far left in America. They fear the populist movement because of its small-government philosophy and its successful activism. The cheapest, easiest way to attack any political opponent is to level accusations of bigotry. Almost every conservative broadcaster and columnist in America has been subjected to that.

The NAACP picked a bad time to brand the tea party with the racist label. Recently, the New Black Panther Party has been in the news because the Justice Department declined to prosecute a case in which three of its members apparently intimidated voters at a Philadelphia polling place. One DOJ lawyer even quit his job, saying he was ordered not to pursue the case because it involved race.

In response to the story, a number of New Black Panthers have been shown on TV saying incredibly bigoted things.

NBPP member King Samir Shabazz even suggested that black Americans kill white babies. This is on tape. Obviously, racial bigotry cuts both ways.
It is true that there's a big difference between the tea party and the NBPP. The tea people have quickly become a potent political force in America, while the NBPP is few in number and brain cells. If it were just about the Panthers, the story would be meaningless. But because Attorney General Eric Holder is involved in the dismissal of the criminal charges, the situation takes on some importance.

One of the weaknesses of the NAACP is that it has rarely acknowledged black racism. The organization is silent on the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Louis Farrakhan. Yet, it is outraged about the tea party. There might be something hypocritical about that.

It is long past time for all Americans to drop the skin color deal. President Obama was smart and correct when he ran as an American, not as an African-American. The president made one misstep — involving himself in the Cambridge police-Harvard professor controversy — but otherwise has steered clear of racial politics.

The NAACP, however, is obviously not as astute as Obama. By saying the tea party members are sympathetic to racism when proof of that is scant, the organization has defined itself as irresponsible. America's motto continues to be: Out of many, one.

Don't tread on that.

Yet Bush's Brain is still in the war room. His lessons learned are those of a job applicant who claims that his greatest weakness is being too conscientious. He doesn't regret the Iraq war; he regrets that he did not attack the war's critics more fiercely. He doesn't regret the administration's bungling of the Katrina response; he regrets the lack of Republican leadership in Louisiana. Rove offers an occasional nod to reality, such as his doubt that the Iraq war would have been waged if it had been known that there were no weapons of mass destruction. Unfortunately for Rove's credibility, however, he revives claims discredited long ago. He describes at length how Clinton staffers ""trashed"" the White House, though investigators were ""unable to conclude whether the 2001 transition was worse than previous ones."" He says it was a ""dangerous falsehood"" that administration officials ""claimed Iraq had been behind 9/11,"" so he must have forgotten Dick Cheney calling Iraq ""the geographic base of the terrorists who had us under assault now for many years, but most especially on 9/11."" The historical rewrite goes back to the 2000 primary campaign. Rove recalls how a veteran introduced Bush at an event in South Carolina with a ""deeply unfair"" attack on John McCain for abandoning veterans. Rove reports that ""McCain rejected Bush's apology as inadequate."" But accounts at the time said Bush neither apologized nor disavowed the slander. Remember the ad attacking Al Gore in which the word ""RATS"" appeared subliminally? ""Our defense was the truth -- we thought it was an accident."" The belief that Cheney, as head of Bush's vice-presidential search, engineered his own selection? ""Far-fetched."" But Rove didn't find it far-fetched to blame a Gore aide for leaking word of Bush's DUI. The revelations continue in the area of domestic policy (Bush's education law, now being rewritten, was ""one of the great modern domestic policy successes"") and national security (Bush kept reading ""My Pet Goat"" after being told of the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001, because he ""wanted to project calm""). Rove's impressive recall mysteriously breaks down when he discusses his near-indictment in the Valerie Plame scandal. He has ""no recollection"" of discussing the matter with Time's Matt Cooper, and he claims he never told MSNBC's Chris Matthews that the CIA's Plame was ""fair game."" He alleges he was ""misled"" by conservative commentator Bob Novak, saying, ""I didn't know or think I was his second source"" on the outing of Plame.

Translating Perry for non-Texans Many years ago, I read a magazine article describing how the national press covered Texas like it is a foreign country  with little understanding of the states politics or politicians. Little has changed in the intervening years. As someone whos been involved in Texas politics for 40 years, I want to translate Rick Perry  as a governor and a candidate. Story Continued Below First, Perry has been a terrific candidate in his home state, though he is untested on the national stage. Meanwhile, his gubernatorial record is mixed  not the panacea of economic growth as portrayed. Lets start with Perry the campaigner. Two years ago, as his primary campaign for reelection against Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison was heating up, The New York Times Sunday Magazine ran a glowing profile of Hutchison as a thoughtful moderate, who had a real chance of defeating Perry  whom the paper portrayed as an out-of-touch hick. Wrong. I remember telling friends that when Perry finished with Hutchison, there would be nothing left but a bomb crater. He ran a tough campaign against her, labeling her part of the Washington establishment and beating her handily. He then won reelection by a significant margin against a well-funded Democrat, former Houston Mayor Bill White. Perry clearly knew how to appeal to the conservative electorate in Texas. He is, however, untested on the national stage. The Texas media tends to be docile, and has rarely challenged Perry during his 10 years as governor  though he has said and done some outrageous things. There will likely be a honeymoon stage with the national media when he enters the presidential race, but Perry will soon face intense scrutiny. Perry demonstrated that he may not be ready for prime time with how he handled the gay marriage issue. First, Perry said that he didnt have any problem with states like New York approving gay marriage  though he didnt think it was appropriate for Texas. It was a states rights issue. However, after getting strong pushback from the religious right community, Perry changed his position, saying he was in favor of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage everywhere."

Republicans promised they would have an open and transparent process in the 112th Congress: DAVID DREIER: ""I regularly wanted more open debate, an opportunity for bipartisanship to proceed through regular order on the House floor It's very important to recognize that we want to use the Rules Committee to ensure that more members can have the opportunity to participate."" [NPR, 11/18/10] KEVIN MCCARTHY: When you look at the Pledge to America that the Republicans have laid out, there is a cultural change in there. There is something that opens up the floor that hasn't been done for quite some time, where bills won't be written in the back of the room, where the bills have to be laid out for 72 hours, where bills actually have an open rule, where people can bring amendments up on the floor [CNN State of the Union 10/10/10] PAUL RYAN: We're going to restore regular order. We're going to have open rules on appropriation bills. We're going to have an open and transparent process and allow any member of Congress to amend bills in committees and things like that. [Kenosha News, 11/29/10] But already they have shut Democrats out of the process in developing the Rules package: Number of Democrats in the room when package was written: 0 Hours of discussion with Democrats: 0 Number of Democratic amendments allowed: 0 And they promised that they would immediately start to cut the deficit: JOHN BOEHNER: We need to cut spending, That's what the American people want. That's what the economy needsBeginning on Jan. 5, the American people are going to watch their Congress do something differently. [CBS News, 12/17/10] ERIC CANTOR: The American people are waiting for this body to step up in a responsible way to stop the spending, which brings on the need for yet even more debt...and get back to a fiscal path that makes sense  It is time to stop taxing, stop spending, and stop borrowing."" [Congressional Record, 5/6/10] PAUL RYAN: We're going to come out of the gates going after spending ... spending cuts, spending controls, reforms of the structure of spending. [The Hill, 12/12/10] HAL ROGERS: Enough is enough. The time to waste opportunities to reign in spending is over. Congress needs to pass a budget that reflects what each and every American family is doing back home- cutting back on spending and reprioritizing for the years ahead. Sticking our heads in the sand will only further our economic challenges and encumber the success of our future generations. [The Foundry, 7/11/10] SPENCER BACHUS: The American people have told us to cut spending and that is what everyone in Washington should work to accomplish next year. That is what Republicans will be fighting to do. [CNBC, 12/17/10] JERRY LEWIS: Republicans on the appropriations committee know that we must be at the forefront of the fight for our nations economic future. With fresh energy and additional fiscally responsible voices on our panel and in the House in the 112th Congress, we can rein in out-of-control spending, curtail burdensome and unnecessary government regulations and earn the trust of the American people. We are ready, willing, and able to fight these battles, and are resolved to bringing our nation back to fiscal sanity. [Politico, 10/28/10] But instead their Rules package does just the opposite. It clears a procedural path to explode the deficit, adding nearly $5 trillion, and makes it easier to pass budget busting bills. While Republicans turn their back on the promises they made, Democrats will move forward holding them accountable and remain committed to priorities of the American people: creating jobs, growing the economy and restoring fiscal responsibility.

Why isnt anyone freaking out? Hitler did this. Hitler, like Obama, was a socialist who came from a dysfunctional family, had a communist father who abused alcohol, womanized and sired several children from different mothers, had a white mother, suffered child abuse and neglect, moved often, lied about his birth and heritage, changed his name, was a narcissist, rose to power with the help of disreputable men, had the Rothschilds as financial backers, stirred up racial conflict and class warfare, wrote a biography about race at age 35, followed up with another book used to launch a political career, supported infanticide (partial-birth abortion), gave big speeches in stadiums, promised change and a new social order, had youth groups singing his praises, used propaganda, used voter fraud and intimidation, controlled the media, created crises, used a poor economy, hated Jews (Israel), pretended to be Christian, advocated population control and euthanasia, socialized medicine, formed a private army and then  killed his political opposition with his private army. Well, I am Obamas political opposition. Thats why I am concerned. Listen to Mark Levin here: I think my friend Scott Spages explains socialism well. Jannique Stewart interviews him: The Obama administration is set to begin formal contact with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, a group dedicated, in its own words, to eliminating and destroying Western civilization from within, and sabotaging its miserable house. What is H.R. 973? This is a bill designed to protect Americans from being forced to comply with foreign laws we did not enact. The motivation for this bill is to keep judges from using Shariah law, but it would apply to any foreign law judges might use to subvert the Constitution. Lets call Congress about it: 202-224-3121. I cant believe Im even typing this! Whats going on? Interesting that in researching Obamas church of 20 years, Trinity United, the Marxist Black Liberation Theology church with racism in its mission statement, journalist Kyle-Ann Shiver found Muslim books for sale in the churchs Christian bookstore! See her column at American Thinker. Obama praises Islam in this montage: Islam is Naziism? Watch this video. Why arent the media all over this? Oh yeah, because Obama controls the media. We have one TV channel with glimpses of truth on it, Fox News. The government controls all the rest. NBC left under God out of the pledge. Harry Reid left under God out of the pledge. Last week, I was a citizen journalist and caught Park Rangers in D.C. on video lying about our national monuments. Now, the government wants to take over radio with fees and fines, and the Internet with a new creepy thing, The National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, that will track our every move. Remember, Cuba voted in Castro, and Germany voted in Hitler. If America votes in Obama for the second time,we deserve a dictator."

Critics say a newly uncovered video of the nominee suggests that he does.

In the video – given to The Daily Caller by sources on Capitol Hill – Bryson refers to the 2009 United Nations climate negotiations in Copenhagen as “the closest thing we have to a world governance organization,” implying it provided the best model for imposing climate regulations on countries around the globe.

Bryson also boasts about his role as an adviser to the U.N. secretary general on climate change in the video.

Bryson’s nomination has already run into problems stemming from his involvement in the founding of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a liberal environmental group, during the 1970s. Critics say Bryson’s advocacy of cap and trade, among other environmental regulations, is at odds with the pro-business mission of the Commerce Department. This video adds to the controversy.

Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Commerce Committee, has denounced Bryson for favoring what the senator calls the administration’s “job-killing agenda.” California Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, has attacked Bryson for being a “green evangelist”.

The nominee’s remarks seem to imply he longs for a more powerful U.N. that can impose its will in addressing climate change, according to Colin Hanna, president of Let Freedom Ring.

“Bryson’s willingness to cede American sovereignty over domestic energy production to the United Nations may be a disqualifier for him to serve as secretary of commerce,” said Brian Darling, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation who watched the video. “Bryson should be asked to explain his comments and where the United Nations derives the authority to force the United States into U.N.-approved regulations on U.S. energy producers.”

“Constitutional conservatives do not believe that the United Nations has the authority under the US Constitution to mandate any changes to U.S. policy and if Bryson was advocating for this, then Senators should take that important factor into consideration during the confirmation process of Bryson.”

Other conservative critics note that the secretary of commerce’s role is to promote trade around the globe and say Bryson’s comments seem to place his commitment to that role in doubt.

“The point is that his views on global government and on global governance, and on climate change are diametrically opposed to goals of the commerce secretary,” said Hanna. “His job is to increase exports, reduce unemployment, provide jobs and help the US economy.”

But Bryson’s advocacy of global carbon emissions standards would accomplish the exact opposite, according to Hanna.

“If we followed the standards of Copenhagen, we would have decreased exports, increased unemployment and a loss of global competitiveness,” Hanna said. “He is wrong on just about every metric by which a commerce secretary is judged.”

However, Myron Ebell, director of energy and climate change at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told TheDC the video was “not much of a smoking gun”.

While Ebell believes conservatives and libertarians have a lot to be concerned about regarding Bryson’s nomination, latching onto his comments in the video are a bit of stretch.

Bryson has received the backing of the New York Times editorial page, which lauded his “distinguished career as a businessman, public servant and environmentalist” and called him the “right businessman-environmentalist for the job” in a June 5 column.

The nominee’s background as CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, does not imply that he has an understanding of competitive business because utilities are quasi-governmental monopolies that would benefit from higher electricity prices stemming from cap and trade, according to Ebell."

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/25/worldnetdaily/planned-parenthood-funding-did-gao-really-find-mil/,"A U.S. Government Accountability Office report says Planned Parenthood Federation of America cannot find some $1.3 billion given to it by the federal government from 2002 through 2008.

In response to an information request from 26 House members and five senators, the GAO report said that Planned Parenthood had received $2.02 billion in federal grants from 2002 through 2008 but that the nation's largest abortion-industry player only reported spending $657.1 million of the taxpayer funds.

The report issued at the request of House Minority Leader John Boehner has several footnotes saying that the Department of Health and Human Services did not report federal funds that were ""obligated"" for the International Planned Parenthood Federation or its member associations from 2002 to 2009.

Understand Planned Parenthood's agenda. Get ""Marketing of Evil: How Radicals, Elitists, and Pseudo-Experts Sell Us Corruption Disguised as Freedom""

Rita Diller of the American Life League affiliate group Stop Planned Parenthood says the GAO report, Table Seven, clearly shows a lot of money is missing.

""The report shows that Planned Parenthood spent $657.1 million, but their own reports show they took in about $2 billion in federal money during the same time period. That leaves the question, 'Where's the $1.3 billion that is unaccounted for?'"" Diller asked.

(Story continues below)

One Planned Parenthood entity in Kansas is facing more than 100 counts of failing to abide by state law, and a request has been made to authorities in Iowa to investigate alleged criminal violations of the law there.

In the two reports available on the Planned Parenthood website, Planned Parenthood's 2007 annual report says the organization took in $336.7 million in federal funding. The 2008 report lists government funding at $349.6 million.

Diller said there's no reasonable explanation for the disparity in the numbers.

""We looked at everything we could think of that might be a source of discrepancy and compared it to the previous GAO report that came out in 2003, but it was for 2001. The reports were the same as far as Medicaid. It was included,"" Diller explained.

She added that Planned Parenthood has established a pattern of a lack of accountability with the taxpayer's money.

""The Planned Parenthood affiliates spending was included. In that 2001 report, they accounted for 79 percent of the government money that they had received. In other words, they showed how they had spent 79 percent of the government money. In this current report, they're only showing how they're spending 32 percent of the government money,"" Diller said.

Diller was referring to a similar report issued by the GAO in 2003.

""This is a huge, huge discrepancy and it opens the door to all kinds of questions,"" Diller said. ""We would like to see some answers. Where is the money and why is Planned Parenthood not being held accountable for this?""

The gaps in Planned Parenthood funding are disturbing, but American Life League President Judie Brown says the biggest issue is the amount of American taxpayers' money going to fund and promote abortion.

""The federal government has repeatedly denied that federal money is funding abortion, but the Federal Public Services Act was designed specifically to support Planned Parenthood's antifamily activities,"" Brown stated.

""According to the report (referring to the recent GAO report) there is no connection between the money that has been spent and Planned Parenthood's activities, but we know that's not true,"" Brown said.

""Money has been pouring into Planned Parenthood's coffers and the amount of it has been increasing for thirty to forty years,"" Brown observed.

Brown adds the trend has continued regardless of who was in the White House.

""That (the party affiliation) is the key factor in all of this. We have had several supposedly pro-life presidents and never has a single president opposed an increase in the funding for Planned Parenthood. Never in the history of Title X,"" Brown added.

A report published by Covenant News in October 2004 showed that Planned Parenthood's Title X funding steadily increased starting in 1990.

An American Life League study of the 2003 GAO report showed that Planned Parenthood received $60.9 million from Medicaid and $58.7 million from Title X of the Public Health Service Act of 2001.

The recent GAO report says the organization received $123.1 million in obligated funds through the Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration.

The American Life League president said the candidate's political party isn't as important as the candidate's convictions.

""My firm conviction is that we have to elect someone who is willing to put principle above politics and rid the government of any funding of any organization that is involved in destroying the family,"" Brown stated.

""The government of our Founding Fathers was one to defend and protect this country, not to destroy the family,"" Brown added.

The Planned Parenthood annual reports show that about one-third of the organization's funding comes from the federal government. Brown believes that if the federal funding stopped, Planned Parenthood would dry up and go away.

""Not only would ending the federal funding put Planned Parenthood out of business, it would destroy their public image. If the federal government withdrew all of the federal tax dollars it's giving to the organization, it would send a clear message to the American people,"" Brown claimed.

""Even liberals would get the idea that there is something fundamentally wrong with their interfering with family life the way Planned Parenthood does,"" Brown stated.

Brown believes that the steady increases in funding through Republican and Democrat presidents and Congresses show the public isn't associating Planned Parenthood with abortion.

""Absolutely there is a disconnect between the funding and the reality. That's because we have elected through pro-life activities several members of Congress, including senators, and presidents who have condoned and encouraged greater funding for this organization,"" Brown explained.

""So in the public's mind, there couldn't possibly be anything wrong with Planned Parenthood because no respected public figure has come out and condemned it,"" Brown continued.

Brown believes support for Planned Parenthood from political leaders who say they're pro-life is the result of the organization's tactical moves.

""They have been infiltrating federal offices, including Senate and House offices and the White House. They have been infiltrating the staff of those entities since the 1960s, in preparation for their first effort to get money from the federal government in the 1970s,"" Brown said.

Planned Parenthood has not returned any calls asking for comment."

With a great team behind me, I helped to turn around the Salt Lake City Olympic Games, and fix a badly broken state budget in Massachusetts. But I have never seen an enterprise as large, as poorly led, and as badly in need of a turnaround as our federal government. USATODAY OPINION Columns In addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes a variety of opinions from outside writers. On political and policy matters, we publish opinions from across the political spectrum. Roughly half of our columns come from our Board of Contributors, a group whose interests range from education to religion to sports to the economy. Their charge is to chronicle American culture by telling the stories, large and small, that collectively make us what we are. We also publish weekly columns by Al Neuharth, USA TODAY's founder, and DeWayne Wickham, who writes primarily on matters of race but on other subjects as well. That leaves plenty of room for other views from across the nation by well-known and lesser-known names alike. Columnists How to submit a column President Obama inherited a severely imbalanced budget, and he made it much worse. Many now question whether we can ever return to fiscal sanity, let alone fiscal strength. A point of no return may well be approaching  a decade of huge deficits could drive our principal payments and interest rates beyond our reach while starving the economy of the capital it needs to grow. We can still correct course because our economy retains tremendous capacity for growth. As president, I will bring to Washington the turnaround philosophy it so badly needs. Any turnaround must begin with clear and realistic goals. By the end of my first term, I will bring federal spending as a share of GDP down from last year's staggering 24.3% to 20% or below. This level is in line with the historical average and nears the tax revenue our economy generates when healthy. With economic growth of 4% a year, meeting this goal will require approximately $500 billion of spending cuts in 2016, and that would still allow us to undo the Obama administration's irresponsible defense cuts. There are three ways to reduce spending, which combined, will achieve a fiscal turnaround of this size. First, eliminate every government program that is not absolutely essential. There are many things government does that we may like but that we do not need. The test should be this: ""Is this program so critical that it is worth borrowing money to pay for it?"" The federal government should stop doing things we don't need or can't afford. For example: Repeal ObamaCare, which would save $95 billion in 2016. Eliminate subsidies for the unprofitable Amtrak, saving $1.6 billion a year. Enact deep reductions in the subsidies for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Legal Services Corporation. Eliminate Title X family planning programs benefiting abortion groups like Planned Parenthood. End foreign aid to countries that oppose America's interests. Second, return federal programs to the states where innovation, cost management and reduction of fraud and abuse can far exceed what Washington achieves. I will block grant Medicaid and workforce training, saving well over $100 billion in 2016. Third, sharply improve the productivity and efficiency of the federal government itself. Where we do want the federal government to act, it must do a better job. For instance: Reduce the federal workforce through attrition and align compensation with the private sector, saving over $40 billion by 2016. Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, a union giveaway that artificially raises costs for government projects, and save taxpayers more than $10 billion a year in the process. Attack rampant fraud in government programs by enacting far stiffer penalties for those who steal from taxpayers. Cutting improper payments in half could save more than $60 billion a year. Consolidate, eliminate and streamline federal departments, agencies and offices following a stem-to-stern review. These three approaches, applied systematically throughout government, will produce a fiscal turnaround. But that achievement will be short-lived if we do not also ensure that both Medicare and Social Security are made sustainable for future generations. Reforms should not affect current seniors or those near retirement, and tax hikes should be off the table. However, the retirement age for younger workers should be increased slowly to keep up with increases in longevity. And Social Security benefits for higher income recipients should grow at a slower rate than for those with lower incomes. Tomorrow's Medicare should give beneficiaries a generous defined contribution and allow them to choose between private plans and traditional Medicare. And lower-income future retirees should receive the most assistance. I believe that competition will improve Medicare and the coverage that seniors receive. What I propose will not be easy. Washington is full of sacred cows that supposedly can't be slaughtered and electrified third rails that allegedly can't be touched. But if we do not act now, the irresistible mathematics of debt will soon lead to unimaginable peril. With the downgrade of America's credit rating, we've gotten a taste of that bitter reality as we see the full potential of fiscal disaster playing out across Europe. We must turn around while we can. Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, is seeking the Republican nomination for president."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/21/blog-posting/does-barack-obamas-health-care-bill-include-1-abor/,"Its official. The concern pro-life organizations had about the ObamaCare legislation funding abortions has been confirmed, as the Obama administration has issued the final rules on abortion funding governing the controversial health care law. Nestled within the individual mandate in the Obamacare act  that portion of the Act requiring every American to purchase government  approved insurance or pay a penalty  is an abortion premium mandate. This mandate requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion. As a result, many pro-life Americans will have to decide between a plan that violates their consciences by funding abortion, or a plan that may not meet their health needs. The Department of Health and Human Services has issued a final rule regarding establishment of the state health care exchanges required under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. As a knowledgeable pro-life source on Capitol Hill informed LifeNews, as authorized by Obamacare, The final rule provides for taxpayer funding of insurance coverage that includes elective abortion and the change to longstanding law prohibiting virtually all direct taxpayer funding of abortions (the Hyde Amendment) is accomplished through an accounting arrangement described in the Affordable Care Act and reiterated in the final rule issued today. To comply with the accounting requirement, plans will collect a $1 abortion surcharge from each premium payer, the pro-life source informed LifeNews. The enrollee will make two payments, $1 per month for abortion and another payment for the rest of the services covered. As described in the rule, the surcharge can only be disclosed to the enrollee at the time of enrollment. Furthermore, insurance plans may only advertise the total cost of the premiums without disclosing that enrollees will be charged a $1 per month fee to pay directly subsidize abortions. The pro-life advocate told LifeNews that the final HHS rule mentions, but does not address concerns about abortion coverage in multi-state plans administered by the Federal Governments Office of Personell Management (OPM). There is nothing in the Affordable Care Act to prevent some OPM (government administered) plans from covering elective abortion, and questions remain about whether OPM multi-state plans will include elective abortion, the pro-life source said. If such plans do include abortion, there are concerns that the abortion coverage will even be offered in states that have prohibited abortion coverage in their state exchanges. The final rule indicates: Specific standards for multi-state plans will be described in future rulemaking published by OPM Set to go into effect in 2014, the unconstitutional provisions found in Section 1303 of the Obamacare Act compel enrollees in certain health plans to pay a separate abortion premium from their own pocket, without the ability to decline abortion coverage based on religious or moral objection. That provision was the subject of a legal document that Bioethics Defense Funds Dorinda C. Bordlee, lead counsel for the group, submitted to the Supreme Court in February. This violates the Free Exercise Clause because religious exemptions are made for groups such as the Amish who morally object to purchasing any insurance, but no exemptions are made for Americans who have religious or moral objections to abortion, Bordlee said. President Obamas healthcare overhaul includes an abortion premium mandate that blatantly violates the conscience rights and First Amendment religious rights of millions of Americans, AUL president Charmaine Yoest said. Nowhere in the Constitution does it require Americans to violate their beliefs and pay for abortions. ADF Senior Counsel Steven Aden says Americans should not be compelled to pay for other peoples elective abortions. No one should be forced to violate their conscience by paying for abortions, but thats precisely what ObamaCare does, he explained. ObamaCare requires that employees enrolled in certain health plans pay a separate insurance premium specifically to pay for other peoples elective abortions and offers no opt-out for religious or moral reasons. Such a mandate cannot survive constitutional scrutiny. BDF president and general counsel Nikolas Nikas said the individual mandate not only forces individuals into private purchases, it also effectively mandates personal payments for surgical abortion coverage, without exemption for an individuals religious or moral objections. He told LifeNews in an email, Like a Russian nesting doll, the individual mandate has nestled within it a hidden, but equally unconstitutional scheme that effectively imposes an abortion premium mandate that violates the free exercise rights of millions of Americans who have religious objections to abortion."

""We have received a number of calls regarding how to enter security information for a baby that has not yet been born,"" Shafer wrote. ""Crazy as it may sound, you MUST include the baby in the overall count of guests in the tour. Its an easy process."" The newsletter then proceeds to spell out how ""the babys security information should be entered"" into the White House system, including such details as: ""GENDER: if the parents know put that gender down if not, you can enter either M or F as well ask you to update it at the time of birth."" All of the information should be updated ""once, the baby is born,"" the newsletter instructs. ""It is ironic that President Obama's staff recognizes the existence of unborn babies for purposes of providing security within the White House -- yet, there is no indication that President Obama has any problem with the fact that throughout the District of Columbia, abortion is now legal for any reason up to the moment of birth, said Douglas Johnson, National Right to Life legislative director. Notably, the newsletter provides no guidance on what the staff should do if an unborn baby is first registered for security purposes, but then aborted. On May 17, the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee plans to hold a hearing on the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 3803), which would generally prohibit abortion in the sixth month and later in the District. If the President wants to provide for the security of the unborn child immediately outside of the White House gates, as well as inside, he should endorse this bill.""

Move over Obama phone, we present the new Hola, Como Estas?! MarcoPhone. Here is the actual mention of the free phones in the bill- SEC. 1107. ACCESS TO EMERGENCY PERSONNEL. (a) SOUTHWEST BORDER REGION EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS GRANTS. The Secretary, in consultation with the governors of the States in the Southwest Border region, shall establish a 2-year grant program, to be administered by the Secretary, to improve emergency communications in the Southwest ELIGIBILITY FOR GRANTS.An individual is eligible to receive a grant under this subsection if the individual demonstrates that he or she (A) regularly resides or works in the Southwest Border region; is at greater risk of border violence due to the lack of cellular service at his or her residence or business and his or her proximity to the Southern border. (3) USE OF GRANTS.Grants awarded under this subsection may be used to purchase satellite telephone communications systems and service that (A) can provide access to 911 service; and (B) are equipped with global positioning You would think that the government agency where these immigrants initially applied for their guest worker visa, was already situated in an urban environment with adequate cell phone service, right? Something tells me that these quest workers will not be taking a short cut through the the cell phone signal-lessdesert to get to and from work. Update-According to some politicos involved with helping craft this bill, the phones in question are for ranchers and locals that can prove they reside along the border. It is obvious that immigrants are also afforded this privilege, since many of them live and work along the border. Why else would it be in an immigration reform bill? And why are taxpayers asked to flip the bill? Update Numero Dos Rubio told Laura Ingraham that the reported MarcoPhone was not for the illegal immigrant, but  for the US citizens and residents who live along the border. But according to the legislation that he helped write, those residing along the border are not identified as being U.S. Citizens or even U.S. residents. So whats it going to be, Marco? Maybe Marco should have clarified this in the bill, perhaps inserting a start date to establish residency? Click here to read Rubios response to the MarcoPhone. Share and Like the story below.

Here come the home raids A new provision tucked away in Obamacare will allow government forces to carry out forced home inspections. Freedom Outpost reported: According to an Obamacare provision millions of Americans will be targeted. The Health and Human Services website states that your family will be targeted if you fall under the high-risk categories below: ** Families where mom is not yet 21. ** Families where someone is a tobacco user. ** Families where children have low student achievement, developmental delays, or disabilities. ** Families with individuals who are serving or formerly served in the armed forces, including such families that have members of the armed forces who have had multiple deployments outside the United States. There is no reference to Medicaid being the determinant for a family to be eligible. In 2011, the HHS announced $224 million will be given to support evidence-based home visiting programs to help parents and children. Update: The rumors of forced home inspections came from a non- credible blog source and have since been debunked"
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/29/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-if-you-cut-out-high-gun-homicid/,"Liberals like to say that “Reality has a liberal bias.”  Well, that was just put to the test…After the Newtown school shooting, President Obama ordered the CDC to study gun crime, to prove we need more gun control.  That study has now been released.  The CDC found that guns are used to defend victims as least as often as criminals use them -- possibly up to ten times more often.  Intervention like background checks showed “mixed” results on crime, while gun turn-in programs were judged ineffective.  Even though the number of guns is up 55 percent since 2003, guns accounted for less than 1 percent of all unintentional deaths in 2010.  Mass shootings are a tiny percentage of gun deaths, and they’re actually declining.  The one stat Obama could use is that America’s gun-related homicide rate is nearly 20 times that of other high-income nations.  But it would be about the same as Belgium’s if you left out California, Illinois, DC and New Jersey: places with some of the strictest gun control laws in the US.

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/17/blog-posting/viral-blog-posts-say-obama-minions-are-allowing-co/,"Shocking statistics surfacing about record busting, low water levels in America’s Great Lakes make no mention of the sale of fresh water supplies by private companies to China, or of President Obama’s executive order and the legal loophole which is allowing these sales.  “Two of the Great Lakes have hit their lowest water levels EVER RECORDED” the US Army Corps of Engineers reported early this year. (1) Corps measurements taken in January of 2013 “show Lake Huron and Lake Michigan have reached their lowest ebb since record keeping began in 1918.”  The chief watershed hydrology expert warns Americans, “We’re in an extreme situation.”  Keith Kompoltowicz heads up the corps district office in Detroit as hand wringing, citizen angst, and shippers’ economic losses pile up. 

“Plunging water levels are beyond anyone’s control,” says another expert, James Weakley.(2) But in one of CiR’s most popular posts, last year we warned, “Lake Michigan water is being shipped by boat loads over to China!  By using a little known loophole in the 2006 Great Lakes Compact, Obama minions are allowing Nestle Company to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan to the tune of an estimated $500,000 to $1.8 million per day profit.” (3) Recent heavy rains and snowfall may mitigate low Lake Michigan water levels somewhat, but this trend must be stopped NOW.
 
President George W. Bush signed into law safeguards for maintaining Great Lakes water, but clever corporate profiteers enabled by Obama Regime bureaucrats discovered this unnoticed loophole. By terming Great Lakes water a COMMODITY, they are selling it off to companies like Nestle for very low prices.  These water profiteers quickly realized a staggering “240 times markup, well over current production costs,” CiR reported. And so our American Great Lakes which hold 20% of the world’s fresh water is flowing into Asia.
  
This week, CiR received a blast Email from a citizens’ group up in arms about the privatization of US water supplies. “Water isn’t a human right,” according to one water profiteer who seeks to privatize and commodify our public resources. The bulletin continues, “From Pakistan to Canada, Nestle is busy draining millions of liters of our fresh water. . .in order to sell back to the public at record prices.”  Interestingly, Canada won an ambitious lawsuit stopping Nestle from draining our Lakes during a drought.  However, American plaintiffs are nowhere to be found.  This citizens’ letter asks us to remember President Obama’s Executive Order 13547 which is part of his Ocean Policy Initiative and the UN’s Law of the Sea treaty (L.O.S.T.)  Unless we ordinary voters and water drinkers step up to the proverbial plate on this crisis, water will be under the control of globalists and their private profiteers.
  
America’s Water Wars are an under-reported crime again us.  Four dams slated for permanent destruction, a red question mark over Hoover Dam’s future, the San Joaquin Valley, the sin of what was done to America’s breadbasket, namely California’s Central Valley, and now our revered Great Lakes and their massive watershed are under the crosshairs of government gone wild.  Citizens dedicated to keeping America’s water within our shores desperately need your attention and support. Go to www.us@sumofus.org to find out more.  Will you be saving your quarters in a piggy bank shaped like a fish to give to your grandchildren so they can put money into the coin slot by their kitchen faucets just to get a drink of water per day?

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/18/charlie-crist/marco-rubio-endorsed-obamacare-his-family-charlie-/,"One of Obamacare's biggest critics is now officially covered under the federal health care exchange: Sen. Marco Rubio. ""Senator Rubio spent time looking at all the options and decided to enroll through the D.C. exchange for coverage for him and his family,"" spokeswoman Brooke Sammon told the Tampa Bay Times. Rubio, a father of four, also took the federal subsidy afforded to lawmakers and staff  a perk worth up to 75 percent of monthly premium costs  that some Republicans wanted to kill off. Even some lawmakers who have enrolled in the exchange have rejected the taxpayer-funded employer contribution. Sammon did not say what led Rubio to decide the health care plan was better than what he could have gotten on his own, and Rubio could not be reached Tuesday. But those who wanted to keep their employer coverage  and that generous subsidy  were directed to use the exchange, called DC Health Link. In addition to the subsidy, Rubio and other federal employees got to pick from far more plans than ordinary people and had access to special customer service to ease their sign ups. ""Senator Rubio is following the law, even though he opposes it,"" Sammon said. That Rubio even had to switch from the existing federal plan to the exchange is thanks to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who amended the Affordable Care Act to require members of Congress and staff join the exchange. It was viewed as a way to needle Democrats, but Democrats accepted the change. As the law headed toward implementation, however, there was a question about the employer contribution, fears growing among Hill staffers who were facing big increases. The Obama administration stepped in and said it would continue the benefit. That saved Rubio and his family a lot, no doubt. Rubio could not have looked at options under a Florida exchange because the state refused to set one up. Sen. Bill Nelson bought his policy on the exchange last week and will also have Medicare Part A, a spokesman said. Pension chief gets big raise State pension fund chief Ash Williams got a big raise. Citizens Property Insurance got its first in-house watchdog. And Florida drivers will soon be able to show proof of car insurance by flashing their cellphones. All of that and more took place Tuesday during the final meeting of 2013 for Gov. Rick Scott and the Florida Cabinet.  Citizens' first inspector general will be Bruce Meeks, a former deputy attorney general and former I.G. for the State Board of Administration (SBA).  Highway safety chief Julie Jones got the go-ahead to implement a law that will make Florida only the second state in the United States to allow motorists to electronically show proof of car insurance. She credited Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, with the idea and said that the new law should be in effect by mid January. ""We're not concerned with a fraud issue here,"" Jones said.  Williams, the executive director of the SBA, was hired more than five years ago at a salary of $325,000 a year. He got his first raise, and it was for $42,500 to bring his paycheck to $367,500. Williams presented a detailed report showing that the fund has grown by 15 percent this year. ""You're doing a great job, Ash,"" Scott told Williams. Veterans bill named for Young A proposal to allow veterans from anywhere to pay in-state tuition if they attend a Florida college or university has a new name on it: U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young. The Senate Education Committee voted unanimously Tuesday to rename SB 84 in honor of Young, who died in October. ""I don't know anyone who has ever served in a public office in Florida who has cared more about our active-duty military and our veterans than Congressman Young,"" said Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, who sponsors SB 84. The ""Congressman C. W. Bill Young Veteran Tuition Waiver Act"" would negate out-of-state fees for all veterans who attend classes in person. That sets it apart from similar but more controversial proposals to grant in-state residency status to children of illegal immigrants (HB 205 and SB 428). The House companion, also expected to be amended to honor Young, is sponsored by Reps. Heather Fitzenhagen, R-Fort Myers, and Kathleen Peters, R-South Pasadena, who is running in the special election for Young's seat. Orlando senator next up He survived a coup attempt and is now officially in line to take over the Florida Senate presidency in fall 2014. Andy Gardiner, the 44-year-old Orlando Republican, was the focus of a personal, yet pomp-and-circumstance filled ceremony Tuesday where the Senate GOP unanimously approved him as its next leader. Gardiner was elected to the Senate in 2008 and most recently served as majority leader. Steve Bousquet and Tia Mitchell contributed."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/wayne-lapierre/wayne-lapierre-says-phoenix-one-kidnapping-capital/,"By Wayne LaPierre Before I tell you how the NRA and our members are going to Stand And Fight politically and in the courts, lets acknowledge that all over this country, tens of millions of Americans are already preparing to Stand And Fight to protect their families and homes. These good Americans are prudently getting ready to protect themselves. It has always been sensible for good citizens to own and carry firearms for lawful protection against violent criminals who prey on decent people. During the second Obama term, however, additional threats are growing. Latin American drug gangs have invaded every city of significant size in the United States. Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world, and though the states on the U.S./Mexico border may be the first places in the nation to suffer from cartel violence, by no means are they the last. The president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border. So the border today remains porous not only to people seeking jobs in the U.S., but to criminals whose jobs are murder, rape, robbery and kidnapping. Ominously, the border also remains open to agents of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. Numerous intelligence sources have confirmed that foreign terrorists have identified the southern U.S. border as their path of entry into the country. When the next terrorist attack comes, the Obama administration wont accept responsibility. Instead, it will do what it does every time: blame a scapegoat and count on Obamas mainstream media enablers to go along. A heinous act of mass murdereither by terrorists or by some psychotic who should have been locked up long agowill be the pretext to unleash a tsunami of gun control. No wonder Americans are buying guns in record numbers right now, while they still can and before their choice about which firearm is right for their family is taken away forever. After Hurricane Sandy, we saw the hellish world that the gun prohibitionists see as their utopia. Looters ran wild in south Brooklyn. There was no food, water or electricity. And if you wanted to walk several miles to get supplies, you better get back before dark, or you might not get home at all. Anti-gun New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had already done everything he could to prevent law-abiding New Yorkers from owning guns, and he has made sure that no ordinary citizen will ever be allowed to carry a gun. He even refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns! Meanwhile, President Obama is leading this country to financial ruin, borrowing over a trillion dollars a year for phony stimulus spending and other payoffs for his political cronies. Nobody knows if or when the fiscal collapse will come, but if the country is broke, there likely wont be enough money to pay for police protection. And the American people know it. Hurricanes. Tornadoes. Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone criminals. These are perils we are sure to facenot just maybe. Its not paranoia to buy a gun. Its survival. Its responsible behavior, and its time we encourage law-abiding Americans to do just that. Since the election, millions of Americans have been lining up in front of gun stores, Cabelas and Bass Pro Shops exercising their freedom while they still have it. They are demonstrating they have a mass determination to buy, own and use firearms. Millions of Americans are using market forces like never before to demonstrate their ardent support for our firearm freedoms. Thats one of the very best ways we can Stand And Fight. Inevitably, the anti-gun media and the gun-ban lobbies are demonizing the purchase of firearms. They call us extremists because we wonder whether we will be able to buy a semi-auto in three years or, even in some states, later this year. Thats despite the fact that President Obama long ago made clear that he wants to ban them all! The media try to make rank-and-file Americans feel guilty about buying a gun. The enemies of freedom demonize gun buyers and portray us as social lepers. But we know the truth. We know that responsible gun ownership exemplifies what is good and right about America. Responsible Americans realize that the world as we know it has changed. We, the American people, clearly see the daunting forces we will undoubtedly face: terrorists, crime, drug gangs, the possibility of Euro-style debt riots, civil unrest or natural disaster. Gun owners are not buying firearms because they anticipate a confrontation with the government. Rather, we anticipate confrontations where the government isnt thereor simply doesnt show up in time. To preserve the inalienable, individual human right to keep and bear armsto withstand the siege that is comingthe NRA is building a four-year communications and resistance movement. The enemies of the Second Amendment will be met with unprecedented defiance, commitment and determination. We will Stand And Fight. First, we are going to devise legal capability like never before. I fervently hope that President Obama does not get to appoint another anti-gun Supreme Court justice like Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan. But he probably will, and we must meet that challenge. His chances of appointing a replacement for one of the five pro-rights justices in the 5-4 Heller and McDonald majorities are high. And theres no doubt he is going to appoint a huge number of new judges to lifetime positions in the lower federal courts. That means the federal courts are going to get worse and worse. So some cases, on which we might have improved our chances of victory by waiting a while, are going to have to be brought now. Besides bringing affirmative pro-rights cases, we will also have to litigate against the flood of new anti-gun federal regulations that are coming, and against anti-gun laws that are going to be enacted in some of the states. Second, we must strengthen the NRA like never before. We are, and always have been, a genuine grassroots organization. And never has your membership been more important. Never has the nra been more in need of your support. The national media, with its slanted and inaccurate news coverage of the gun issue, has given the gun-ban groups the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of free advertising. Now, the threat is even greater. Michael Bloomberg and George Soros are each, individually, far wealthier than the entire National Rifle Association. When the NRA spends money on political advertising, we have to raise those funds from you$20, $50, $250, or $1,000 at a time. In the last election, Bloomberg alone spent $16 million and that doesnt even count the indirect spending by groups funded by Soros and his fellow billionaires. The hard truth is that due to Bloomberg, Soros, and the rest of their ilk, the dangers require that we increase our presence all across the countryin Congress, the state capitols, and in your city and towns. As we Stand And Fight, the third, and most important, part of our action plan demands that we organize like never before. Thats the most important part of all. Every gun owner should be an active member of the NRA. Every gun owner should be sure that every member of his or her family is an active member. For most of the last hundred years, a strong NRA has been the indispensable shield against the destruction of our nations Second Amendment rights. Now, an even stronger nra is the only chance gun owners have to withstand the coming siege. This begins with remembering to keep your own membership active, or reactivate it if it has lapsed. It means reminding yourself, I have a son and daughter who arent members and should be. It means reaching out to your hunting and shooting friends and personally telling them why its so important that they join the NRA now, during this time of peril. The NRA is launching a nationwide, full-court initiative to urge every gun owner, and every non-gun-owning lover of freedom, to join the NRA and fight this battle. I will personally be traveling all over America enlisting new members. We must reach out to the tens of millions of gun owners who are not yet NRA membersto the gun owners who care about their own rights but who have been duped by Obama and the national media into believing that the Obama and Bloomberg gun controls will only affect other people. They are naively sitting on the sidelines, imagining themselves immune from the coming siege. Yet no matter how much I travel, I cant be everywhere. NRA members, though, can be everywhere. We already are. The 4 million of us belong to every community in the United States. We are the largest civil rights organization in the world, and we have been part of the fabric of America ever since 1871. So it is you, proud NRA members, who are the key to enlisting new members in the ranks of our army of freedom. NRA grassroots has always been our Associations greatest strength. To compete with Bloomberg and his gang, it must be much stronger still. Historically, we have always been able to rely on volunteers, and Im going to ask you and need you to answer the call to help throughout the next four years. Every year, shooting is becoming more and more popular, with more people engaging in the shooting sports for fun. More people are buying guns and trying new disciplines, such as 3-gun competitions, sporting clays, practical shooting and so on. As we Stand And Fight, lets continue to make the shooting sports one of the fastest-growing recreational activities in America. By doing so, and by telling others about it, well popularize and make gun owning and shooting more mainstream than ever before. That will be even more effective if we remember to invite new people to participate and provide them with the responsible mentorship and guidance that the NRA has exemplified for over 140 years. We cant win the political war if we lose the cultural war. One of the great protectors of the Second Amendment is the popular, active, responsible use of firearms for shooting and hunting. We dont want America to become like England, where some of that nations outstanding rifle competitors keep their hobby a dark secret from their neighbors for fear of social disapproval. Were not going to let the anti-gunners push us into that zone. As I remind people every day, we are the majority. We have so much to be proud of as gun owners, shooters and freedom lovers. That pride, especially when its not hidden in the closet, is itself a form of protection for the Second Amendment. We will not surrender. We will not appease. We will buy more guns than ever. We will use them for sport and lawful self-defense more than ever. We will grow the NRA more than ever. And we will be prouder than ever to be freedom-loving NRA patriots. And with your help, we will ensure that the Second Amendment remains Americas First Freedom. We will Stand And Fight."

That pride, especially when its not hidden in the closet, is itself a form of protection for the Second Amendment. We will not surrender. We will not appease. We will buy more guns than ever. We will use them for sport and lawful self-defense more than ever. We will grow the NRA more than ever. And we will be prouder than ever to be freedom-loving NRA patriots. And with your help, we will ensure that the Second Amendment remains Americas First Freedom. We will Stand And Fight."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/20/wayne-lapierre/wayne-lapierre-says-obama-ignores-border-fence-law/,"By Wayne LaPierre Before I tell you how the NRA and our members are going to Stand And Fight politically and in the courts, lets acknowledge that all over this country, tens of millions of Americans are already preparing to Stand And Fight to protect their families and homes. These good Americans are prudently getting ready to protect themselves. It has always been sensible for good citizens to own and carry firearms for lawful protection against violent criminals who prey on decent people. During the second Obama term, however, additional threats are growing. Latin American drug gangs have invaded every city of significant size in the United States. Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world, and though the states on the U.S./Mexico border may be the first places in the nation to suffer from cartel violence, by no means are they the last. The president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border. So the border today remains porous not only to people seeking jobs in the U.S., but to criminals whose jobs are murder, rape, robbery and kidnapping. Ominously, the border also remains open to agents of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. Numerous intelligence sources have confirmed that foreign terrorists have identified the southern U.S. border as their path of entry into the country. When the next terrorist attack comes, the Obama administration wont accept responsibility. Instead, it will do what it does every time: blame a scapegoat and count on Obamas mainstream media enablers to go along. A heinous act of mass murdereither by terrorists or by some psychotic who should have been locked up long agowill be the pretext to unleash a tsunami of gun control. No wonder Americans are buying guns in record numbers right now, while they still can and before their choice about which firearm is right for their family is taken away forever. After Hurricane Sandy, we saw the hellish world that the gun prohibitionists see as their utopia. Looters ran wild in south Brooklyn. There was no food, water or electricity. And if you wanted to walk several miles to get supplies, you better get back before dark, or you might not get home at all. Anti-gun New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had already done everything he could to prevent law-abiding New Yorkers from owning guns, and he has made sure that no ordinary citizen will ever be allowed to carry a gun. He even refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns! Meanwhile, President Obama is leading this country to financial ruin, borrowing over a trillion dollars a year for phony stimulus spending and other payoffs for his political cronies. Nobody knows if or when the fiscal collapse will come, but if the country is broke, there likely wont be enough money to pay for police protection. And the American people know it. Hurricanes. Tornadoes. Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone criminals. These are perils we are sure to facenot just maybe. Its not paranoia to buy a gun. Its survival. Its responsible behavior, and its time we encourage law-abiding Americans to do just that. Since the election, millions of Americans have been lining up in front of gun stores, Cabelas and Bass Pro Shops exercising their freedom while they still have it. They are demonstrating they have a mass determination to buy, own and use firearms. Millions of Americans are using market forces like never before to demonstrate their ardent support for our firearm freedoms. Thats one of the very best ways we can Stand And Fight. Inevitably, the anti-gun media and the gun-ban lobbies are demonizing the purchase of firearms. They call us extremists because we wonder whether we will be able to buy a semi-auto in three years or, even in some states, later this year. Thats despite the fact that President Obama long ago made clear that he wants to ban them all! The media try to make rank-and-file Americans feel guilty about buying a gun. The enemies of freedom demonize gun buyers and portray us as social lepers. But we know the truth. We know that responsible gun ownership exemplifies what is good and right about America. Responsible Americans realize that the world as we know it has changed. We, the American people, clearly see the daunting forces we will undoubtedly face: terrorists, crime, drug gangs, the possibility of Euro-style debt riots, civil unrest or natural disaster. Gun owners are not buying firearms because they anticipate a confrontation with the government. Rather, we anticipate confrontations where the government isnt thereor simply doesnt show up in time. To preserve the inalienable, individual human right to keep and bear armsto withstand the siege that is comingthe NRA is building a four-year communications and resistance movement. The enemies of the Second Amendment will be met with unprecedented defiance, commitment and determination. We will Stand And Fight. First, we are going to devise legal capability like never before. I fervently hope that President Obama does not get to appoint another anti-gun Supreme Court justice like Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan. But he probably will, and we must meet that challenge. His chances of appointing a replacement for one of the five pro-rights justices in the 5-4 Heller and McDonald majorities are high. And theres no doubt he is going to appoint a huge number of new judges to lifetime positions in the lower federal courts. That means the federal courts are going to get worse and worse. So some cases, on which we might have improved our chances of victory by waiting a while, are going to have to be brought now. Besides bringing affirmative pro-rights cases, we will also have to litigate against the flood of new anti-gun federal regulations that are coming, and against anti-gun laws that are going to be enacted in some of the states. Second, we must strengthen the NRA like never before. We are, and always have been, a genuine grassroots organization. And never has your membership been more important. Never has the nra been more in need of your support. The national media, with its slanted and inaccurate news coverage of the gun issue, has given the gun-ban groups the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of free advertising. Now, the threat is even greater. Michael Bloomberg and George Soros are each, individually, far wealthier than the entire National Rifle Association. When the NRA spends money on political advertising, we have to raise those funds from you$20, $50, $250, or $1,000 at a time. In the last election, Bloomberg alone spent $16 million and that doesnt even count the indirect spending by groups funded by Soros and his fellow billionaires. The hard truth is that due to Bloomberg, Soros, and the rest of their ilk, the dangers require that we increase our presence all across the countryin Congress, the state capitols, and in your city and towns. As we Stand And Fight, the third, and most important, part of our action plan demands that we organize like never before. Thats the most important part of all. Every gun owner should be an active member of the NRA. Every gun owner should be sure that every member of his or her family is an active member. For most of the last hundred years, a strong NRA has been the indispensable shield against the destruction of our nations Second Amendment rights. Now, an even stronger nra is the only chance gun owners have to withstand the coming siege. This begins with remembering to keep your own membership active, or reactivate it if it has lapsed. It means reminding yourself, I have a son and daughter who arent members and should be. It means reaching out to your hunting and shooting friends and personally telling them why its so important that they join the NRA now, during this time of peril. The NRA is launching a nationwide, full-court initiative to urge every gun owner, and every non-gun-owning lover of freedom, to join the NRA and fight this battle. I will personally be traveling all over America enlisting new members. We must reach out to the tens of millions of gun owners who are not yet NRA membersto the gun owners who care about their own rights but who have been duped by Obama and the national media into believing that the Obama and Bloomberg gun controls will only affect other people. They are naively sitting on the sidelines, imagining themselves immune from the coming siege. Yet no matter how much I travel, I cant be everywhere. NRA members, though, can be everywhere. We already are. The 4 million of us belong to every community in the United States. We are the largest civil rights organization in the world, and we have been part of the fabric of America ever since 1871. So it is you, proud NRA members, who are the key to enlisting new members in the ranks of our army of freedom. NRA grassroots has always been our Associations greatest strength. To compete with Bloomberg and his gang, it must be much stronger still. Historically, we have always been able to rely on volunteers, and Im going to ask you and need you to answer the call to help throughout the next four years. Every year, shooting is becoming more and more popular, with more people engaging in the shooting sports for fun. More people are buying guns and trying new disciplines, such as 3-gun competitions, sporting clays, practical shooting and so on. As we Stand And Fight, lets continue to make the shooting sports one of the fastest-growing recreational activities in America. By doing so, and by telling others about it, well popularize and make gun owning and shooting more mainstream than ever before. That will be even more effective if we remember to invite new people to participate and provide them with the responsible mentorship and guidance that the NRA has exemplified for over 140 years. We cant win the political war if we lose the cultural war. One of the great protectors of the Second Amendment is the popular, active, responsible use of firearms for shooting and hunting. We dont want America to become like England, where some of that nations outstanding rifle competitors keep their hobby a dark secret from their neighbors for fear of social disapproval. Were not going to let the anti-gunners push us into that zone. As I remind people every day, we are the majority. We have so much to be proud of as gun owners, shooters and freedom lovers. That pride, especially when its not hidden in the closet, is itself a form of protection for the Second Amendment. We will not surrender. We will not appease. We will buy more guns than ever. We will use them for sport and lawful self-defense more than ever. We will grow the NRA more than ever. And we will be prouder than ever to be freedom-loving NRA patriots. And with your help, we will ensure that the Second Amendment remains Americas First Freedom. We will Stand And Fight."

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/29/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-75-small-businesses-say-theyl/,"Too often, politicians forget how their decisions impact real people. They dig in to protect their political agenda at all costs, even if it hurts the very people they were elected to serve. And when that happens, no one gets hurt as much as working class Americans. Business interests and labor unions can afford to hire lobbyists to look out for them. But most workers and small business owners are counting on the men and women they elected to be their eyes, ears and voices. If we are to truly speak for them, we should take their opinions into account when deciding whether to move forward on the most important issues before us: the implementation of ObamaCare. [pullquote] In 2010, Congress passed ObamaCare on a divisive, partisan vote. Its supporters claimed it would solve our health care problems. But with each passing day, we see mounting evidence of how ObamaCare creates more problems than it solves, particularly for small business owners and the people who work for them. For example, when I visited Land O' Lakes, Florida in 2010, I met restaurant owner Ben Pumo. I stood in his kitchen at Benedetto's Ristorante Italiano and listened to him explain how ObamaCare would impact his business and employees he had come to see ""as part of his family."" He explained how it would impose new costs on his business, how it would be a blow to his freedom to hire workers as he pleased without triggering new taxes, and how he feared the worst was still yet to come. Today, Benedettos employs fewer than their earlier peak of 56 employees before the Great Recession. Like every business owner in America, hes working hard every single day to get back to where he once was  and then surpass that. But people like Mr. Pumo, who are trying to grow their businesses, are discouraged by ObamaCare. Once a business reaches 50 full-time employees, the ObamaCare tax will kick in. At that point, businesses will have to pay for their employees health coverage or they will have to pay a $2,000 tax penalty for each full-time employee after the first thirty. But because there are no penalties if part-time employees are not offered coverage, ObamaCare basically encourages small businesses to hire people part-time instead of full-time. That is one reason why last month, 322,000 Americans were forced into part-time work. If you are a small business with about 47, 48 or 49 employees and you want to hire more people, ObamaCare encourages you to hold back on hiring new workers or cut the hours of existing ones so that you dont reach 50 employees. That is why 75% of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours. I live just a few blocks away from the real world impact of ObamaCare. Miamis famed Calle Ocho is lined with small grocery stores, bakeries, restaurants, beauty salons and small auto shops, among many other small businesses. Most of them are run by immigrants chasing the American dream. Many of them are too small to trigger the employer mandate, but their owners and their workers still have to deal with the individual mandate, which forces people to buy insurance on expensive state level exchanges. Because of ObamaCare, many of them will now have a new expense and it could be enough to put them out of business or force a downsizing. Instead of forcing people into expensive exchanges, we should adopt market-based reforms that will provide Americans with more health care options at more affordable rates. We still have time to do something about this. This September, Congress will have to pass another short term spending bill to fund the federal government. We should pass one that keeps the government open, but doesn't waste any more money on ObamaCare. The president and his allies  and even some Republicans  will accuse us of threatening to shut down the government. In fact, it is President Obama who insists on shutting down the government unless it funds his failed ObamaCare experiment. He will say that we are refighting old battles and that it is time to move on. ObamaCare might be old news in Washington, but for millions of middle class Americans, it is just beginning. Instead of giving more speeches, I wish the president would listen more. He should listen to the people who took every penny they had saved and started their own businesses. They will tell him that ObamaCare could force them to lay people off and maybe even close their doors. He should listen to the young couple that already has insurance and are happy with it and their doctor. They will tell him that ObamaCare just cost them that insurance they were happy with and the doctor that they loved. He should listen to full time workers who barely get by working 40 hours a week. They will tell him that ObamaCare just forced them to work part-time. It is time to admit that ObamaCare isn't going to work, decide not to waste a single cent more on it, and replace it with market-based reforms that will give people more health insurance choices and options. It's still not too late. This September may be our last best chance to do anything about this disastrous law. Republican Marco Rubio represents Florida in the U.S. Senate. He is a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Foreign Relations. He was a candidate for president in 2016."

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/06/blog-posting/bloggers-say-pentagon-may-court-martial-christian-/,"The Pentagon has released a statement confirming that soldiers could be prosecuted for promoting their faith: Religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of DefenseCourt martials and non-judicial punishments are decided on a case-by-case basis. The statement, released to Fox News, follows a Breitbart News report on Obama administration Pentagon appointees meeting with anti-Christian extremist Mikey Weinstein to develop court-martial procedures to punish Christians in the military who express or share their faith. (From our earlier report: Weinstein is the head of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, and says Christiansincluding chaplainssharing the gospel of Jesus Christ in the military are guilty of treason, and of committing an act of spiritual rape as serious a crime as sexual assault. He also asserted that Christians sharing their faith in the military are enemies of the Constitution.) Being convicted in a court martial means that a soldier has committed a crime under federal military law. Punishment for a court martial can include imprisonment and being dishonorably discharged from the military. So President Barack Obamas civilian appointees who lead the Pentagon are confirming that the military will make it a crimepossibly resulting in imprisonmentfor those in uniform to share their faith. This would include chaplainsmilitary officers who are ordained clergymen of their faith (mostly Christian pastors or priests, or Jewish rabbis)whose duty since the founding of the U.S. military under George Washington is to teach their faith and minister to the spiritual needs of troops who come to them for counsel, instruction, or comfort. This regulation would severely limit expressions of faith in the military, even on a one-to-one basis between close friends. It could also effectively abolish the position of chaplain in the military, as it would not allow chaplains (or any service members, for that matter), to say anything about their faith that others say led them to think they were being encouraged to make faith part of their life. Its difficult to imagine how a member of the clergy could give spiritual counseling without saying anything that might be perceived in that fashion. In response to the Pentagons plans, retired Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin, who is now executive vice president of the Family Research Council (FRC), said on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning: Its a matter of what do they mean by proselytizing. I think theyve got their defintions a little confused. If youre talking about coercion thats one thing, but if youre talking about the free exercise of our faith as individual soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, especially for the chaplains, they I think the worst thing we can do is stop the ability for a soldier to be able to exercise his faith. FRC has launched a petition here which has already collected over 60,000 signatures, calling on Secretary Hagel is stop working with Weinstein and his anti-Christian organization to develop military policy regarding religious faith. **UPDATE** The FRC petition has now exceeded more than 40,000 signatures at the time of this update.

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/04/facebook-posts/closer-look-facebook-post-mans-struggle-obamacare-/,"A man who attempted to sign up for Obamacare online was told that a fine of over $4,000 dollars a year for refusing to take out mandatory health insurance could be taken directly from his bank account, and that his drivers license would be suspended and a federal tax lien placed against his home, according to an entry on the HealthCare.gov Facebook page. If true, the implementation of Obamacare is going to be a whole lot more draconian than Americans have been led to believe. Will Sheehan claims that when he tried to sign up for Obamacare and then register to opt out, he received an ominous warning. Sheehans full Facebook post reads; I actually made it through this morning at 8:00 A.M. I have a preexisting condition (Type 1 Diabetes) and my income base was 45K-55K annually I chose tier 2 Silver Plan and my monthly premiums came out to $597.00 with $13,988 yearly deductible!!! There is NO POSSIBLE way that I can afford this so I opt-out and chose to continue along with no insurance. I received an email tonight at 5:00 P.M. informing me that my fine would be $4,037 and could be attached to my yearly income tax return. Then you make it to the REPERCUSSIONS PORTION for non-payment of yearly fine. First, your drivers license will be suspended until paid, and if you go 24 consecutive months with Non-Payment and you happen to be a home owner, you will have a federal tax lien placed on your home. You can agree to give your bank information so that they can easy Automatically withdraw your penalties weekly, bi-weekly or monthly! This by no means is Free or even Affordable. Sheehan went on to point out that the site makes you input all your personal information before giving you an indication of the costs, meaning a database of the uninsured is being built. He added that he could not afford to pay the premium so would have to break the law and pay the fine, leaving him with no health care coverage. The federal government has consistently denied that any fines pertaining to Obamacare non-compliance could be seized from bank accounts, despite reports last year that the IRS had hired 16,500 new agents to harass citizens who attempt to evade the new law. Theres no criminal sanctions for not paying this, and theres no ability to levy a bank account or do seizures, then-IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman said in April 2010. In addition, Americans who refuse to pay for mandatory health insurance shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution, according to the law itself. Section 1501(g)(2) of the Affordable Care Act also states that the IRS cannot file notice of lien with respect to any property of a taxpayer by reason of any failure to pay the penalty imposed by this section. Either Sheehans claim that he received this notice is a lie, or the feds have been dishonest with the American people all along, and the revolt against Obamacare is about to take dont tread on me to a whole new level.

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/16/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-no-doctors-who-went-american-medi/,"In the current fight over the government shutdown, Republicans are simply representing the views of the American people.

Americans didn’t ask for Obamacare, they don’t want it, but now their insurance premiums are going through the roof, their doctors aren’t accepting it, and their employers are moving them into part-time work or firing them to avoid the law’s mandates.

Contrary to Obama’s promises, it turns out: You can’t keep your doctor, you can’t keep your insurance — you can’t even keep your job. In other words, it’s a typical government program, but this one wrecks your health care.

Also, the president did raise taxes on the middle class in defiance of his well-worn campaign promise not to. Indeed, Obamacare is the largest tax hike in U.S. history.

Among the other changes effected by this law are:

— Obamacare will allow insurers to charge 50 percent higher premiums for smokers, but prohibits insurers from increasing premiums for those with HIV/AIDS.


— Nationally, Obamacare will increase men’s individual insurance premiums by an average of 99 percent and women’s by 62 percent. In North Carolina, for example, individual insurance premiums will triple for women and quadruple for men.

— Health plans valued at $27,500 or more for a family of four will be taxed at a rate of 40 percent.

— No doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare.

— A 62-year-old man earning $46,000 a year is entitled to a $7,836 government tax credit to buy health insurance. But if he earns an extra $22 in income, he loses the entire $7,836 credit. He will have more take-home pay by earning $46,000 than if he earns $55,000. (If he’s lucky, he already works for one of the companies forced by Obamacare to reduce employees’ hours!)

— Merely to be eligible for millions of dollars in grants from the federal government under Obamacare, programs are required to meet racial, ethnic, gender, linguistic and sexual orientation quotas. (That’s going to make health care MUCH better!)

— Obamacare is turning America into a part-time nation. According to a recent report by economist John Lott, 97 percent of all jobs added to the economy so far this year have been part-time jobs. Ninety-seven percent!

— Obamacare is such a disaster that the people who wrote it refuse to live under it themselves. That’s right, Congress won a waiver from Obamacare.

Responding to the people’s will, House Republicans first voted to fund all of government — except Obamacare. Obama refused to negotiate and Senate Democrats refused to vote on it.

Then the Republicans voted to fully fund the government, but merely delay the implementation of Obamacare for one year. Obama refused to negotiate and Senate Democrats refused to vote on it.

Finally, the Republicans voted to fully fund the government, but added a requirement that everyone live under Obamacare. No more special waivers for Congress and their staff, and no waivers for big business without the same waivers for individuals.

Obama refused to negotiate and Senate Democrats refused to vote on it. So as you can see, Republicans are the big holdup here.

A longtime Democratic operative, Karen Finney, explained the Democrats’ intransigence on MSNBC to a delighted Joan Walsh (aka the most easily fooled person on TV) by comparing House Republicans to a teenager trying to borrow his mother’s car. “No, I’m not negotiating!” Mother says. “It’s MY CAR!”

This wasn’t a stupid slip of the tongue that other Democrats quickly corrected. Finney had used the exact same metaphor to a panel of highly agreeable MSNBC guests the day before. (MSNBC books no other kind of guest.)

Liberals think the government is their car and the people’s representatives are obstreperous teenagers trying to borrow it. The government. Which belongs to Democrats.

That’s not how the Constitution views the House of Representatives. To the contrary, the House is known as “the People’s House,” because it is considered most reflective of the people’s will. Its members represent roughly the same number of people and are elected every two years.

As a matter of fact, the Republicans who mistakenly assume they have something to do with running the government represent most of the people who pay taxes to run it. So it’s more like a teenager who is making the car payments, maintaining the car insurance and taking responsibility for registering the car being told: “It’s not your car.”

But the Democrats refuse to even negotiate. It’s their government — and if you Republicans think you’re going out dressed like that, you’ve got another think coming! Needless to say, they absolutely will not consider the Republicans’ demand that Democrats merely live under Obamacare themselves.

Instead, Democrats say “the Koch brothers” are behind the effort to defund Obamacare.

They say Republicans are trying to “burn the whole house down” (Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz); “have lost their minds” (Sen. Harry Reid); are trying to negotiate “with a bomb strapped to their chest” (senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer); are “legislative arsonists” (Rep. Nancy Pelosi); and are engaging in “blatant extortion” (White House press secretary Jay Carney).

The MSNBC crowd calls Republicans “arsonists” every 15 seconds.

They ought to check with fellow MSNBC host Al Sharpton. He knows his arsonists! In 1995, Sharpton whipped up a mob outside the Jewish-owned Freddy’s Fashion Mart with an anti-Semitic speech. Sometime later, a member of the mob torched the store, killing seven Hispanic employees.

Every single Democrat in the country uses the exact same talking point: We “refuse to negotiate with a gun being held to our head.”

Which means the Democrats will not negotiate at all — not now, not ever. House Republicans have already passed three-dozen bills defunding, or otherwise restricting, Obamacare. Senate Democrats and liberal commentators had a good laugh at Republicans for passing them.

Now they’re paying attention!

If you are in the minority of Americans not already unalterably opposed to Obamacare, keep in mind that the only reason the government is shut down right now is that Democrats refuse to fund the government if they are required to live under Obamacare.

That’s how good it is!

Barbara Buono and Gov. Chris Christie, DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz released the following statement:

“Throughout this campaign, Chris Christie has tried to whitewash his record of mismanaging New Jersey’s economy and pushing an agenda that is out of step with mainstream New Jersey voters. But tonight we heard the truth. In Chris Christie’s New Jersey, property taxes have soared, and the state has seen the second highest rate of foreclosures in the nation. With one of the worst job records in the country, Christie’s promised ‘economic comeback’ never happened. Not only has Christie’s tenure been terrible for New Jersey’s economy, but he is also wrong on the issues. He chose to put his national ambitions over New Jersey when he vetoed legislation to keep dangerous guns off the streets. He cut equal pay for women, calling it ‘senseless bureaucracy.’ He vetoed an increase in the minimum wage. And he continues to stand in the way of marriage equality for LGBT couples in New Jersey. That is Chris Christie’s real record.

“Tonight, Barbara Buono called attention to the contradictions between Christie’s campaign message and the reality of his failed record as governor. She also provided a stark contrast for New Jersey voters. In Barbara Buono, New Jersey will have a governor who always reflects their mainstream values, not just when the cameras are rolling. Barbara will work to grow New Jersey’s economy and renew the state’s commitment to education that has been gutted under Chris Christie. On November 5, the people of New Jersey should choose Barbara Buono to lead the comeback that Chris Christie never did.”

If so, with one partner, multiple partners or same-sex partners? Be ready to answer those questions and more the next time you go to the doctor, whether its the dermatologist or the cardiologist and no matter if the questions are unrelated to why youre seeking medical help. And you can thank the Obama health law. This is nasty business, says New York cardiologist Dr. Adam Budzikowski. He called the sex questions insensitive, stupid and very intrusive. He couldnt think of an occasion when a cardiologist would need such information  but he knows hell be pushed to ask for it. The presidents reforms aim to turn doctors into government agents, pressuring them financially to ask questions they consider inappropriate and unnecessary, and to violate their Hippocratic Oath to keep patients records confidential. Embarrassing though it may be, you confide things to a doctor you wouldnt tell anyone else. But this is entirely different. Doctors and hospitals who dont comply with the federal governments electronic-health-records requirements forgo incentive payments now; starting in 2015, theyll face financial penalties from Medicare and Medicaid. The Department of Health and Human Services has already paid out over $12.7 billion for these incentives. Dr. Richard Amerling, a nephrologist and associate professor at Albert Einstein Medical College, explains that your medical record should be a story created by you and your doctor solely for your treatment and benefit. But the new requirements are turning it into an interrogation, and the data will not be confidential. Lack of confidentiality is what concerned the New York Civil Liberties Union in a 2012 report. Electronic medical records have enormous benefits, but with one click of a mouse, every piece of information in a patients record, including the social history, is transmitted, disclosing too much. The social-history questions also include whether youve ever used drugs, including IV drugs. As the NYCLU cautioned, revealing a patients past drug problem, even if it was a decade ago, risks stigma. On the other end of the political spectrum is the Goldwater Institute, a free-market think tank. It argues that by requiring everyone to have health insurance and then imposing penalties on insurers, doctors and hospitals who dont use the one-click electronic system, the law is violating Americans medical privacy. The administration is ignoring these protests from privacy advocates. On Jan. 17, HHS announced patients who want to keep something out of their electronic record should pay cash. Thats impractical for most people. Theres one question they cant ask: Thanks to the NRA, Section 2716 of the ObamaCare law bars the federal government from compelling doctors and hospitals to ask you if you own a firearm. But thats the only question they cant be told to ask you. Where are the womens rights groups that went to the barricades in the 1980s and 1990s to prevent the federal government from accessing a womans health records? Hypocritically, they are silent now. Patients need to defend their own privacy by refusing to answer the intrusive social-history questions. If you need to confide something pertaining to your treatment, ask your doctor about keeping two sets of books so that your secret stays in the office. Doctors take the Hippocratic Oath seriously and wont be offended. Are such precautions paranoid? Hardly. WikiLeaker Bradley Manning showed how incompetent the government is at keeping its own secrets; incidents where various agencies accidentally disclose personal data like Social Security numbers are legion. And thats not to mention the ways in which commercial databases are prone to hacking and/or exploitation. Be careful about sharing your medical secrets with Uncle Sam. Betsy McCaughey is the author of Beating ObamaCare."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/22/americans-tax-reform/obama-has-proposed-442-tax-hikes-says-anti-tax-gro/,"Since taking office in 2009, President Barack Obama has formally proposed a total of 442 tax increases, according to an Americans for Tax Reform analysis of Obama administration budgets for fiscal years 2010 through 2015.

The 442 total proposed tax increases does not include the 20 tax increases Obama signed into law as part of Obamacare.

“History tells us what Obama was able to do. This list reminds us of what Obama wanted to do,” said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.

The number of proposed tax increases per year is as follows:

-79 tax increases for FY 2010

-52 tax increases for FY 2011

-47 tax increases for FY 2012

-34 tax increases for FY 2013

-137 tax increases for FY 2014

-93 tax increases for FY 2015

Perhaps not coincidentally, the Obama budget with the lowest number of proposed tax increases was released during an election year: In February 2012, Obama released his FY 2013 budget, with “only” 34 proposed tax increases. Once safely re-elected, Obama came back with a vengeance, proposing 137 tax increases, a personal record high for the 44th President.

In addition to the 442 tax increases in his annual budget proposals, the 20 signed into law as part of Obamacare, and the massive tobacco tax hike signed into law on the sixteenth day of his presidency, Obama has made it clear he is open to other broad-based tax increases.

During an interview with Men’s Health in 2009, when asked about the idea of national tax on soda and sugary drinks, the President said, “I actually think it’s an idea that we should be exploring.”

During an interview with CNBC’s John Harwood in 2010, Obama said a European-style Value-Added-Tax was “something that would be novel for the United States.”

Obama’s statement was consistent with a pattern of remarks made by Obama White House officials refusing to rule out a VAT.

“Presidents are judged by history based on what they did in power. But presidents can only enact laws when the Congress agrees,” said Norquist. “Thus a record forged by such compromise tells you what a president — limited by congress — did rather than what he wanted to do.”

The specific code sent to me will make any Americans hair stand up on the back of their neck. The code is ICD 9 E 978. After reading this code I decided that it was my duty to investigate further and get to the bottom of why we have a medical code in the United States for Legal Execution. Below are my results. ICD 9 E 978 ""Legal Execution All executions performed at the behest of the judiciary or ruling authority [whether permanent or temporary] as: asphyxiation by gas beheading, decapitation (by guillotine) capital punishment electrocution hanging poisoning shooting other specified means INJURY UNDETERMINED WHETHER ACCIDENTALLY OR PURPOSELY INFLICTED According to reports, more than 68,105 new medical codes are being added due to the Obamacare monstrosity. Doctors all across the nation have been complaining due to the overwhelming burden it places upon them. Just the time consumption alone, making sure these codes are accurate, will inevitably take time away from the doctor/patient relationship creating a barrier of paperwork while destroying the personal experience with your doctor. While these doctors are correct to state it will be even more of a burden, they are not correct to state this has come out of Obamacare itself. Let me explain. These codes were not created by Obamacare, however Obamacare is trying to implement every American citizen under international codes to link us to the international system. These codes were actually created by the WHO (World Health Organization) . The WHO is a specialized agency of the United Nations. [...] The questions that need to be asked and answered are: Why has the United States been subjected to International Medical Coding without our knowledge? Why are we allowing coding that goes against our principles and constitution? Why do we have a code for ""Legal Execution"" which is illegal in America? With the exception of those given the death penalty after trial by jury. When did the Department of Homeland Security find out about this coding? Why havent they addressed this (since they are supposed to protect the people)? Why is DHS sending any kind of Medical Coding to the states? Why havent the doctors spoken out to make Americans and Medicare recipients aware that their information has been given to an International body? Why havent they made people aware that the WHO is a specialized agency of the United Nations and directly linked to the League of Nations under the guise of collecting data? Why would we allow forced medical coding through congressional bills to come from an organization that supports UN Agenda 21, Millennium Development Goals, and supports the eradication of sprawl (which is average people like you and I)? Is law enforcement aware of this specific code? If so why havent they brought this to the attention of the American people? Continue reading via Freedom Outpost..."

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/09/chain-email/did-barack-obama-sign-bill-forgive-all-outstanding/,"0 WASHINGTON, D.C.  Americans who are under the financial strain of repaying student loan debt may now be off the hook for their education costs. President Obama signed a new federal bill this week releasing any student who has accrued outstanding debt because of the high interest rates and outrageous balances caused by college loans. Any student, past or present, who has taken loans from the federal government within the last 10 years to pay for higher education, will no longer be required to pay back those loans. Said President Obama. This forgiveness also is to be extended to any student currently enrolled in college, who may need financial assistance for the next several years as they finish their degrees. The idea of student loan forgiveness has been in the news for several years now, as students are forced year-after-year to leave school due to crippling costs of a higher education in the US. With most students not able to afford any facet of college without loans, the government has given out nearly $1 trillion dollars to those seeking a form of higher education. Although certain costs of school are generally offset by private loans, grants, and scholarships, almost every student currently in a 2 or 4-year program has some existing loans with the US government. Education is the single most important thing in my mind when it comes to furthering this great nation. Said Obama. I can think of no better way to help the young people, this next generation of thinkers and doers, than by helping them to stand on their feet more firmly, and to give them some hope that they can and will receive their degrees, and they can work towards a future for themselves and their families, and not just a future of paying back debt. Although the bill was signed on Thursday afternoon in a live press conference, the forgiveness of loans will not begin until the end of 2016 at which point current and former students will begin to see interest and repayment amounts dwindle automatically, eventually leaving everyone with a complete zero-dollar balance. Even while the government has decided to forgive loans from the public sector, private held companies such as Sallie Mae, the leading lender for higher education, still has sky-high interest rates and non-budging repayment schedules. With close to $1 billion in net income every year, Sallie Mae has stated that they are not interested in following suit with the governments plan for loan forgiveness. We are a private company, and private lenders. We have no interest in not pursuing every possible avenue to squeeze every penny we can out of our borrowers. Said Carla Edwarton, CEO of Sallie Mae. Education is important to us, but paying back your loans are what we care about. We arent loan sharks, we arent going to break your kneecaps if you dont pay, as much as we would like to[But] you can bet we love making all that sweet, sweet high-interest rate cash. Students who are currently making payments or have defaulted on their loans can expect to receive a packet letter within the next 3 to 4 months detailing how their assistance loans will be forgiven and what percentage, if any, will be left owed to private companies and firms. 0 Comments comments"

Bill Cassidy (R-LA) commented on the Senate’s agreement to authorize veterans affairs (VA) clinics in Lafayette and Lake Charles.  The House of Representatives passed bipartisan legislation to authorize these clinics 177 days ago. Dr. Cassidy, along with the Louisiana Republican delegation, wrote a letter urging veterans to advocate for Senate action on passing legislation that would improve veterans’ access to VA clinics.

Dr. Cassidy released the following statement:

“It’s been more than 177 days since the House passed bipartisan legislation that would authorize these VA clinics. Only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate healthcare did Harry Reid and Senate Democrats take action. We need to continue working towards patient-centered solutions so all veterans have access to quality healthcare.”"

(Photo: Michael Mulvey for USA TODAY) One thing I learned running a small business is that you have to play to your strengths. Our economy has its challenges, but America is at the forefront of an energy boom. We have more combined oil, coal and natural gas resources than any other nation on Earth. That's why, every day, Republicans are working on a true all-of-the-above energy agenda that will help lower costs, create jobs, strengthen our allies and make us a nation of builders again. Such a strategy has the potential to usher in a new era of American leadership and prosperity  but we can't do it alone. President Obama says he supports all of the above, but his actions prove the opposite. Just consider his plan to impose excessive new EPA regulations on power plants  what amounts to a national energy tax. It will have Americans asking, ""Where are the jobs?"" for years while their bills go up, electric grid reliability is compromised, and energy-intensive sectors like manufacturing take on even more water. The president is so out of touch that he won't even approve the popular Keystone XL pipeline. As for his party's leaders in the Senate, they also talk a big game about energy only to block our most common-sense solutions. Here are some examples: The House has acted to prevent duplicative federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing, which has lowered unemployment in states that have safely and effectively regulated this type of energy production. And we have pressed the president to open more areas to exploration and production, and cut back red tape on new energy projects. We'll continue that effort this summer with legislation to reduce permitting delays for new factories  making it easier to plan, invest and revitalize manufacturing. America has the resources to become an energy superpower, but we need the right infrastructure in place to get there. Thanks to technological advancements, natural gas production on state and private lands is up 33% and oil is up 61% since 2009. That energy boom, however, is being throttled by a pipeline system that has not kept pace with our changing energy landscape. The House has voted to expedite the approval of new pipelines, and will soon advance additional legislation to create a more efficient process for cross-border pipeline approvals and prevent another debacle like we've seen with the Keystone pipeline. The nearly six-year delay in approving Keystone is costing Americans more than 100,000 jobs and nearly a million barrels of oil a day, and forcing our most important trading partner to look to China for new energy markets. The House passed a bill last year that would green-light the project immediately, creating jobs and reducing our dependence on unstable energy sources. But the president and Senate Democrats remain opposed. Advancing our energy independence is imperative for our economic and national security, and for that of our allies. Just last week, Russia announced it was cutting off natural gas exports to Ukraine, which is also the transit route for 15% of Europe's natural gas. The House has voted to give the president the tools he needs to counter Vladimir Putin's aggression, but we must do more to break Russia's energy stranglehold on Europe. With a backlog of 26 liquefied natural gas export applications pending, the House will act where the administration has not and move a bill to expedite the approval of more LNG exports. Doing so will not only strengthen our international partners, it will help create jobs and promote energy production here at home. In addition to all this, we've also passed legislation to prevent that national energy tax from taking effect without congressional approval, while advancing several other bills aimed at stopping regulations targeting coal-fired electricity. And because a true all-of-the-above policy requires us not only to harness the resources we have, but to use them wisely, we have passed bipartisan, common-sense legislation to promote increased energy efficiency. The president has no more elections to win, yet he allows the narrow interests of his most extreme political allies to dictate an agenda that puts jobs and opportunity out of reach for middle-class families. While he's writing America's energy workers off, we're trying to give them the tools they need to succeed. That's how we play to our strengths, and that's how America can win against significant global competition. Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, is speaker of the house.

Taking on a die-hard tea partier The establishment scored huge victories in primary races Tuesday. Their next potential target: Rep. Justin Amash. Business groups, executives in Michigan and even some of his fellow home state Republicans are abandoning the hard-line tea party conservative, famous in Washington for voting no on bills as wide ranging as the debt ceiling to defense funding. Story Continued Below Members of the Meijers family, owners of the massive Midwest supermarket chain, are all in behind Brian Ellis, Amashs Republican primary challenger. As are the political arms of Home Depot, Dow Chemical and the International Franchise Association. The primary race is in the beginning stages of what could be an epic throwdown in August between the business community, usually reluctant to play in a Republican primary, and big conservative outsiders, including the Koch brothers and the Club for Growth, who are dumping money into Amashs campaign. ( Also on POLITICO: Poll: Opposition to tea party rises) It is just one example of the many battles playing out in Republican races all across the country, where an emboldened establishment wing has accused movement conservatives of straying too far from the partys pro-business roots  and winning. Once you get to know [Amash], and I know that district from being around Michigan for long enough, hes completely out of line with these people, said Rep. Mike Rogers, a senior Michigan Republican in an interview. He votes more with the Democrats than with the Republicans, and thats not out of principle, thats out of him branding himself as something different. Rogers even cut Ellis a $5,000 check, a bold move for a fellow Republican Michigander. The president of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce said his group will consider endorsing Ellis, adding that many one-time Amash business supporters have switched their allegiances after growing frustrated with his voting record and unhelpful office on even routine matters. And Amash isnt getting love from the rest of his Wolverine State colleagues in D.C., either. Lawmakers and corporate and association PACs are typically wary of putting money up against a sitting member of Congress, but many have started to pour money into Ellis campaign. Ellis is the founder of an investment advisory firm. ( Also on POLITICO: Thom Tillis beats tea party challenge in North Carolina) Because my vote explanations shine a spotlight on Congress, Ive upset people who are used to operating in the dark, said Amash in a statement. They dont like having their votes exposed as fringe and outside the mainstream. Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) said he will stay neutral. Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.) said she didnt know if she would weigh in, before running into the House chamber. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said Amash isnt a serious member of Congress, and added this is someone here playing games, and trying to be on the opposite side of Republicans. Nunes gave his opponent $5,000. Nunes said his dealings with Amash on a water bill critical to California turned him off. Hes been leading the charge and not telling the truth about [NSA surveillance policies], Nunes said in an interview. Hes been fanning the flames, and it gets to the point where my assessment is this is a guy willing to work with San Francisco Democrats to protect bait fish, and at the same time hes Al Qaedas best friend in the Congress. Amash has been critical of the National Security Agency and caused a floor fight last year over a controversial amendment to curb the agencys ability to collect phone data from Americans. ( On the Ground: How Lindsey Graham outmaneuvered the tea party) Amash defended himself against Nunes attacks. I vote less often with Nancy Pelosi, the real San Francisco Democrat, than any member of Congress. I opposed Nunes water bill on constitutional grounds, and his comments are unbecoming of a representative, Amash said. The push to try to beat back against the conservative flank is a continuing trend for the party. On Tuesday night, GOP establishment forces defeated a Rand Paul-endorsed candidate in North Carolina, and Speaker John Boehner obliterated a self-branded tea party challenger who had support from outside groups. Main Street Partnership President Steve LaTourette said Tuesday nights primary establishment victories will just increase how aggressive groups get in the upcoming primaries and general elections. They are looking for their first win of the season and I think our guys are happy with what happened in North Carolina and Ohio and if you look at that were going to remind [Club for Growth President Chris] Chocola every time, LaTourette said. LaTourette said that it is unlikely Main Street Partnership will enter the Amash race because it is focusing on defending Republican incumbents against conservative challenges."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/29/chain-email/claim-solar-panels-drain-suns-energy-are-satire-no/,"<National Report>This week, a scientific research facility in Wyoming made a startling discovery that is certain to change the way millions of Americans look at the environmentalism movement, after they found conclusive evidence that solar panels not only convert the suns energy into usable energy, but that they are also draining the sun of its own energy, possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming. Scientists at the Wyoming Institute of Technology, a privately-owned think tank located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, discovered that energy radiated from the sun isnt merely captured in solar panels, but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels, in a process they refer to as forced photovoltaic drainage. Put into laymens terms, the solar panels capture the suns energy, but pull on the sun over time, forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing, WIT claims in a scientific white paper published on Wednesday. Imagine a waterfall, dumping water. But you arent catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, youre going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely. WIT is adamant that theres no immediate danger, however. Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, wed start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years. The study was commissioned in August 2011 by the Halliburton corporation, who wanted to learn if the energy giant should start manufacturing and selling solar panels domestically and internationally. Halliburtons executives wanted to know more about the sustainability of solar energy and how photovoltaic technology might evolve over the next ten years. But based on the findings of WITs research in the field, Halliburton revealed on Friday that they will not be entering the solar energy market. Solar panels destroying the sun could potentially be the worst man-made climate disaster in the history of the world, and Halliburton will not be taking part in that, the company stated in a press release issued Friday morning. Its obvious, based on the findings of this neutral scientific research group, that humans needs to become more dependent on fossil fuels like oil and coal, not less. Because these so-called `green technologies are far more dangerous to the Earth than any hydrofracking operation or deep-water drilling station. What good is clean air when our very sun is no longer functional?"

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/07/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-us-didnt-address-cybersecurity-/,"Last week, I rolled out my blueprint to take our country back. It is a list of the most important problems that we must solve so that we can take our country back from the career politicians who have hijacked it, slowed it down, and turned it into a bloated bureaucracy that only works for the big, the powerful, the wealthy, and the well-connected. It is a strategy for us to work together to return this nation to what our Founding Fathers intended: a citizen government. Our government today does not belong to the people. It does not serve the people. It is bloated, corrupt, and inept. The very character of our nation is threatened and the world is becoming a more tragic and dangerous place because we are not leading. It is this last issue that I want to talk about today. In my Blueprint, I say that my priority is to defeat ISIS and put America back in the leadership business. Because that is what we must do. They are at our shores and now they are in our community centers and their measure of victory is the body count. I am angry. I am angry that this President and Hillary Clinton do not understand this threat and refuse to call it radical Islamic terrorism. I am angry that Hillary Clinton dares to ask what difference does it make how four Americans died in Benghazi. And then she tells us that we must empathize with our enemies. Mrs. Clinton, when the United States does not answer a purposeful terrorist attack on our embassy with a purposeful and powerful response, but instead blames a video, you invite more terrorism and bloodshed. I am angry that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton declared victory in Iraq in 2011, abandoned all our hard-won gains for political expediency and contrary to the advice of our generals, thus leaving vast swaths of territory and too much weaponry to be gobbled up by ISIS. I am angry that President Obama unilaterally decides that well accept thousands of Syrian refugees while his administration admits we cannot determine their ties to terrorism. Mostly I am outraged because the murder, mayhem, danger and tragedy we see unfolding in Paris, Beirut, San Bernardino, are the direct consequence of this administrations policies. You cannot lead from behind. No, Mrs. Clinton. No, President Obama: climate change is not our most pressing national security challenge. Our most pressing national security threat is radical, Islamist terrorism around the world and here at home  both lone wolves and packs of wolves. ISIS is an evil that must be confronted. It must be destroyed. *** Today, as we talk about technology and how to use it, I want to talk about a critical piece of our strategy to defeat ISIS and restore American leadership in the world: cybersecurity. Like too many other foreign policy priorities, President Obama and Hillary Clinton have refused to see what is in front of them when it comes to cybersecurity: that the United States is woefully unprepared for cyberterrorism. That we are vulnerable. And that while we sit idly by, our enemies are building their capabilities. They are consolidating power. Our strategy for approaching cybersecurity is based on a document from 2011 that hasnt been updated. That means it has been out-of-date for years now. Having operated at the highest levels of the tech world for many years, I can tell you: if you wait four years to move, youre going to lose. In January 2011, the first iPad was not even a year old. Snapchat didnt exist. Instagram was not a part of our lexicon. The fact that we have not updated our cybersecurity strategy since then is unconscionable. Meanwhile, our adversaries and our enemies have not been sitting on their hands. In China, Xi Jinping has made cybersecurity a central component of his regime, creating a centralized council on cybersecurity that he leads. He says that there is no national security without cybersecurity. Hes right. The Russian government has hacked the White House and the State Department, gaining access to sensitive information about the Presidents schedule and emails. This summer, they hacked into the Pentagon and accessed emails from the Joint Chiefs. Worse, our adversaries recognize this American weakness and are working together to consolidate their power in the wake of our failures. In May, China and Russia signed an extensive cybersecurity pact in which they agreed they that they will not hack each others government systems and that they will work together to ensure effective censorship of their people. And it is not just governments that are working hard to advance a technological agenda that threatens the United States. ISIS is getting better and better at using encrypted communications to recruit and radicalize within our country  and encouraging those recruits to carry out attacks. Our own FBI Director tells us that ISIS now knows how to effectively make their recruits disappear online. And theyve established around-the-clock help desks to pass all of this technological information and training along to other terrorists. Just hours before the Paris attacks began and against all the evidence, President Obama declared ISIS contained and took a victory lap. After the tragedy in San Bernardino, he spoke from a podium in the Oval Office but offered no strategy and no leadership. Vintage Obama. This is not a JV team, Mr. President. They are not contained. They are learning where we are vulnerable and they are exploiting it. And we are vulnerable. The former head of the U.S. militarys cyber-command, Keith Alexander, tells us that we are woefully unprepared to handle an attack on our critical infrastructure, which could shut down our economy and peoples day-to-day lives. The Director of National Intelligence admitted that we have basically no U.S. cyber deterrence. *** It does not have to be this way. We are the worlds leader in innovation and entrepreneurship. We are home to Silicon Valley, to Google, to the iPhone. Having led the worlds largest technology company, I know what it will take for America to lead in this realm. We have the talent and the capabilities. We now need a leader who will work with the citizens of our nation to channel those talents into solving one of the most urgent national security challenges of our time. The first thing we need to realize is that this battle will not be won in Washington, D.C. Right now, private sector companies can and should take the lead on cybersecurity  but the government continues to get in the way. We need to remove burdensome regulations that keep companies from fighting cyberattacks on their own  and we need to stop the government from turning these incidents into crime scenes that companies cant touch. Encryption is an important tool. But the conversation going on now in Washington is, as usual, missing the point. As Im sure many of you have seen time and again, the political class wants to dictate on a subject they dont understand. They want to tell you we must either revamp the Patriot Act  a law from 14 years ago  or theres nothing we can do. That is a false choice. Technology has moved on. I spent my career in the technology industry. Michael Hayden called me after September 11th. He said he needed help. A tractor-trailer of HP product was heading to retailers in the DC area. After the call, we told the driver to pull over. From there, an NSA police car provided our driver an armed escort to NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. The point is  when it comes to protecting our national security  technology experts should be and can be a partner. Instead of arguing about a law that is 14 years old, I will gather our top technology leaders  the best and the brightest  and not a room full of politicians. Because our national security will be strengthened when we empower individuals and companies to protect their own data and information while giving our national security experts the tools they need to protect our country. We also need to facilitate better information-sharing between private sector companies and the government. That doesnt mean that we ask companies to share personally-identifiable information that threatens individual customers privacy. We simply need to ensure that private companies and the government have the ability to communicate about critical national security issues  and that the private sector can share that information without fear of frivolous lawsuits. And where the government is going to get involved in cybersecurity, it needs to be done in a smart, coordinated, timely way. For example, we need to give the NSA access to all of the information it needs to effectively investigate San Bernardino as soon as possible. Senator Tom Cotton has proposed legislation that will do this. Representative Michael McCaul also outlined a number of common-sense proposals to address this crisis today. We know what needs to get done. We just need the political willpower and leadership to pass this legislation and implement these reforms. But this will not be enough. As President, I will establish a central command and appoint a director who is empowered to manage cybersecurity across the government. They will be responsible for developing an effective, up-to-date strategy that will show our adversaries that we are serious about cybersecurity. Today, our approach to cybersecurity lacks many of the most basic elements that we require of private sector companies. We know a big factor in the OPM hack was a lack of two-factor authentication, something that has been standard industry practice for years. As usual, government is holding itself to a different, lower standard. That is unacceptable. We must send a clear signal to our adversaries that repeated, aggressive hacking will not be tolerated. That starts with the development of a serious strategy. But it also means that we have to be willing to push back. This President has not done that. When we learned that China had hacked into our systems, President Obama had a state visit. When we held recent economic dialogues with China, we agreed on over 100 different things  including wildlife trafficking and volcano research. None of these 100-plus points of agreement addressed cybersecurity. China sees this and knows that they can push ahead with an aggressive economic and military agenda because they are not being challenged. *** Here is the point: We must defeat ISIS and put America back in the leadership business. That will only happen when we have and implement an effective cybersecurity strategy. This administration has weakened our national security and it has all but ignored cybersecurity  allowing foreign governments and terrorists to attack private companies and infiltrate our national security apparatus. There is a lot we must do and all of it will require leadership. We must have a president who understands technology  both as a tool and as a weapon. And, no, you dont wipe a server with a cloth, Mrs. Clinton. We must have a president who will engage with our nations best and brightest technology minds. I do and I will. Because innovation led by citizens is the answer  not stagnation led by bureaucrats. And so with your support, we will take our country back. God bless you and may God continue to bless the United States of America."

The Fort Pierce Islamic Center, where Mateen worshipped several times a week, was under investigation by both the FBI and DHS as early as 2011 for ties to a worldwide Islamic movement known as Tablighi Jamaal which was linked to several terrorist organizations. But the investigation was shut down under pressure from the Clinton-ran State Dept. and DHSs Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office out of fear of offending Muslims, according to recently retired DHS agent Philip Haney. The FBI had opened cases twice on him, and yet they found no evidence to charge him; it means they didnt go through the same basic, analytical process that I went through over a three- or four-hour period in which I was able to link the mosque to my previous cases, he told WND on Sunday. In other words, the FBI had limited options at stopping Mateen because it was ordered to back off its investigation into his mosque. Both Clinton and the Obama administration have a history of enabling Islamic terrorism. In 2012, Clintons State Dept. was backing al-Qaeda in Iraq, which morphed into ISIS, and other Islamic extremist groups as a proxy army to topple Syrian President Bashir al-Assad. The Salafist [sic], the Muslim Brotherhood and AQI [al-Qaeda in Iraq] are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria, a leaked memo between her State Dept. and the Pentagon stated. The West, Gulf countries, and Turkey support [this] opposition, while Russia, China and Iran support the [Assad] regime. This secret document confirms that Clintons State Dept.  and the Obama administration in general  were directly responsible for the rise of ISIS, which is now targeting the West. The former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, confirmed the documents importance. I dont know that [the Obama administration] turned a blind eye [to ISIS], I think it was a decision; I think it was a willful decision, he said. Clinton even admitted some responsibility. The United States had  to be fair  we had helped create the problem were now fighting, she said in an interview with Fox anchor Greta Van Susteren. When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, we had this brilliant idea we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force on Mujahideen, equip them with Stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets inside Afghanistan. Now you look back [and] the people were fighting today, we were supporting in the fight against the Soviets. Additionally, on Oct. 1 President Obama authorized a shipment of guns to ISIS-linked militants in Syria  the exact same day he demanded more gun control in response to Umpqua Community College shooting in Ore. The approval came at a National Security Council meeting on Thursday, CNN reported at the time. The President also emphasized to his team that the U.S. would continue to support the Syrian opposition as Russia enters the war-torn country. But as his administration admitted in the 2012 leaked memo, the Syrian opposition is predominantly jihadist militants  just like the Orlando killer.

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/04/tom-daschle/do-us-global-aids-dollars-build-stability-less-vio/,"As the 2016 primaries unfold, its time for candidates of both parties to focus on expanding the big-hearted policies that have made this nation so exceptional. In recent years, the most effective of those policies has been global health  that is, putting U.S. resources to work saving lives in developing nations by spreading health treatments that work here at home. In a study for the Bipartisan Policy Center last November, we showed how the largest global health project in history, the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), has not only saved millions of lives but also improved Americas national security. ADVERTISEMENT Under PEPFAR, launched under former President George W. Bush and enhanced under President Obama, with bipartisan support in Congress over more than a decade, 9.5 million men, women and children, mainly in Africa, are receiving lifesaving anti-retroviral drugs. Some 68 million have gotten HIV testing and counseling, 5.5 million orphans and vulnerable children have received care and support, and 190,000 new healthcare workers have been trained. In addition, our study found that in PEPFAR countries, political instability and violence have fallen 40 percent (compared to just 3 percent in equivalent non-PEPFAR countries), while economic growth has increased  and so has Americas reputation. Now, a new survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, released in January, has discovered that, while Americans are proud of the accomplishments of programs like PEPFAR, a majority (53 percent) believe we are already doing enough to improve health in developing countries. And a majority (55 percent) believe that spending more money wont make much difference in improving health in developing countries. Those are disturbing statistics. They stray far from reality. The truth is that the U.S. has the innovation and the resources to put an end to rampant deaths not only from AIDS but from such scourges as malaria, tuberculosis and hepatitis C. Based on the PEPFAR experience, we have proof that health will be improved dramatically  and Americans themselves will benefit. The good news is that the Kaiser study provides important guidance on how to persuade Americans that our nation should do more. The starting point is better education about global health. The public is woefully misinformed not just about the success of U.S. programs but about their cost. The Kaiser survey, taken in December, found that, on average, those polled believed that 31 percent of the federal budget is spent on foreign aid (including health programs). The actual figure is less than 1 percent (correctly estimated by just 3 percent of those polled). Researchers discovered that, when respondents were informed of the correct spending on foreign aid, their support of increased spending on global health improved significantly. Actual spending on global health by the U.S. government has been steady at between $9.2 billion and $10.2 billion per year since 2009, with the exception of 2015, when an additional $3.7 billion was spent to stem the Ebola crisis that directly threatened the health of Americans. For 2016, global health represents just 0.2 percent of federal spending, or about $10 billion out of $4.1 trillion. Another way of saying this is that just $32 out of the average Americans tax bill will go to global health programs  with about $19 for fighting AIDS, $2 for malaria, $1 for tuberculosis and $2 for maternal and child health. Kaisers national study also asked respondents to give the most important reason for spending U.S. tax dollars to improve global health. In first place, by far, was because its the right thing to do, chosen by 46 percent. Thats no surprise. This is the most benevolent country in the world. When our 43rd president announced PEPFAR in 2003, he said, Seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many. Our humanitarian instincts are the bedrock of global health programs, but the Kaiser study also pointed to other strong reasons to spend federal money: to improve our diplomatic relationships, to help ensure national security, to help the U.S. economy, and to improve the U.S.s image around the world. In total, these four justifications topped the list for 48 percent of respondents. Another practical reason to improve health abroad is to prevent diseases like Ebola and the Zika virus from spreading through our own population. As the presidential campaign progresses, we believe that Americans will want to hear candidates appeal to what Abraham Lincoln referred to as the better angels of our nature. Wiping out diseases in poorer countries is simply the right thing to do. But Americans are pragmatic people, too, and, as the Kaiser research shows, we want our contributions to be both cost-effective and beneficial to our own nation as well. As our research has shown, programs like PEPFAR meet all of those tests: humanitarian, practical and self-serving. In this election season, Americans must require candidates for public office who demonstrate the leadership we will need to ensure global  and national  health. Daschle served in the Senate from 1987 to 2005 and as Senate majority leader from 2001 to 2003. Frist, a physician, served in the Senate from 1995 to 2007 and as Senate majority leader from 2003 to 2007."

She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. States dont count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldnt influence the election results, then the absentee ballots arent counted. Who votes by absentee ballot? Students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. The historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 67-33% Republican. In 2000, when Al Gore won the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone. A 67-33 breakout of those yields a 1.33- to 0.667-million Republican vote advantage, so Bush would have gotten a 667,000-vote margin from Californias uncounted absentee ballots alone! So much for Gores 500,000 popular vote victory. (That was the headline on the N.Y. Times, and it was the lead story on NBC Nightly News, right? No? Youre kidding.) Getting back to the win the popular vote/lose the Electoral College scenario: Thank G-d we have that, or else California and N.Y. would determine every election. Every time. But the Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. Farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. Shortcomings? Sure. The E.C. can make an R vote meaningless in a very few heavily D states or vice versa. But without the Electoral College, the countrys entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states. @4jmclemons Read here..

(Although Google will still not report it like other media institutions.) media is also hiding from you that Trump CRUSHED Hillary in the Electoral College (EC). As of today, most if not all media outlets show that Trump won the election with only 279 EC votes. But the truth is Trump also won Michigan with 16 EC votes and Arizona with 11 EC votes for a total of 306 EC votes. Hillary only won 228 EC votes but it looks like she barely won New Hampshire which should put her at 232 EC votes. As a result, Trump won 57% of all EC votes. Gateway Pundit Hey Change.org! Scrap that petition of yours too. Your basis for this petition on how Hillary should be president because she got popular vote is baseless. Trump got popular vote and electoral vote. Period! On December 19, the Electors of the Electoral College will cast their ballots. If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win, it reads. However, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine  which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay! We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton. Why? it continues. Mr. Trump is unfit to serve. His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic. (T)he Electoral College can actually give the White House to either candidate. So why not use this most undemocratic of our institutions to ensure a democratic result?"

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/17/blog-posting/no-someone-wasnt-paid-3500-protest-donald-trump-it/,"PHOENIX A.Z. (AP) — For months now, rumors have circulated the Internet that individuals were being paid to protest at rallies held by presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Today a man from Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona back in March has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event.
“I was given $3,500 to protest Donald Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills,” said 37-year-old Paul Horner. “I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part.”

Trump supporters have been claiming that protesters are being paid by the Bernie Sanders’ campaign, but Horner disagrees.

“As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” Horner said. “The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called ‘Women Are The Future’. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is.” Horner continued, “It was mostly women in their 60’s at the interview that I went to. Plus, all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address. No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton.” (And people with Youtube channels that buy Youtube views on Youtube to promote fake news on fake sites like ABC News).

“I knew those weren’t real protesters, they were too organized and smart,” said 59-year-old Tom Downey, a Trump supporter who attended the rally in Fountain Hills. “I knew there was something up when they started shouting all these facts and nonsense like that. The best we could do was just yell and punch em’ and stuff.” Downey continued, “I think we did a good job though. I was shouting at them the whole time, calling them losers, telling them to get a job or go back home to mommy’s house; I got a bunch of high-fives from my fellow Trump supporters. It was a great time.”

When asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally.

“Almost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos $500, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750. I don’t think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received $300 across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back”

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not understand why Trump protesters would need to be paid.

“I’ll protest that guy for free,” Bradley said. “Trump is creating a place for like-minded, ignorant, bigoted, hate-filled individuals to gather and unite. You wouldn’t have to pay me anything to protest that.” Bradley continued, “Trump supporters are the last kind of people to donate socks to the homeless, they only care about themselves and their white race. I would love the day I ever see a donation from a Trump supporter, I think it would make me change my opinion about them.”

Horner said the group had a mandatory six-hour training class that had to be completed before protesting at Trump’s rally.

“During training we were taught chants to shout like ‘Dump Trump’ and ‘Trump Is A Racist’, things like that. We were told how to respond to anti-Trump comments too. If a Trump supporter said something about how great his wall will be, the Latinos in our group would say, ‘We’re just going to tunnel underneath it.’ They even gave me a shirt to wear at the rally which said ‘F*ck Donald Trump’ along with a sign to hold that said ‘Make America White Again’.”

David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the Silverback gorilla my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a child,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous.

Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons.

For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.” Mikkelson continues, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it.

In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems.

We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,” Mikkelson laughs. “And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours.

Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘.

The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; It’s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons.

I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, I’d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.”

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/12/blog-posting/bloggers-hype-hillary-clinton-health-poll-represen/,"Concerns about Hillary Clinton’s health are “serious—could be disqualifying for the position of President of the U.S.,” say nearly 71% of 250 physicians responding to an informal internet survey by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS). About 20% said concerns were “likely overblown, but should be addressed as by full release of medical records.” Only 2.7% responded that they were “just a political attack; I have confidence in the letter from her physician and see no cause for concern.”

While more than 81% were aware of her history of a concussion, only 59% were aware of the cerebral sinus thrombosis, and 52% of the history of deep venous thrombosis.

More than 78% said the health concerns had received “not enough emphasis” in the media, and only 2.7% that there had been “too much emphasis.”

Nearly two-thirds said that a physician who had a concern about a candidate’s fitness to serve for health reasons should “make the concerns known to the public.” Only 11% said a physician should “keep silent unless he had personally examined the patient,” and 10% that the candidate’s health was “off limits for public discussion.”

Eighty-eight respondents submitted comments. One said that “the public interest will ALWAYS override either privacy rights or rights of self-determination in the case of a presidential candidate.” Another mentioned Clinton’s “so called loss of memory claimed during her FBI questioning about her email server.” Beyond the specific questions, one remarked that “I think that the candidate should be honest with the public about his/her health!” The history of the concussion was concerning: “The public must watch the movieConcussion to realize that such an injury does affect thought process.”

A poll of 833 randomly selected registered voters by Gravis Marketing showed that nearly half (49%) were not aware of the “well documented major health issues that Hillary Clinton has.” Nearly three-fourths (74%) were unaware of Bill Clinton’s statement that Hillary suffered a “terrible” concussion requiring “six months of very serious work to get over.” The majority (57%) thought that candidates should release their medical records.

“Both physicians and other voters think that health concerns are relevant when choosing a presidential candidate,” states AAPS executive director Jane M. Orient, M.D. “However, more than 40% of physician respondents were unaware of the cerebral sinus thrombosis, and the vast majority of voters were not aware of all of Clinton’s problems or their potential serious long-term implications for cognitive function.”

The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) is a national organization representing physicians in virtually all specialties and every state. Founded in 1943, AAPS has the motto “omnia pro aegroto,” which means “all for the patient.”"

It could be argued that for Senator-elect Jones to present his credentials and take his oath is so highly privileged that it cannot be delayed for anything. McConnells move is an insult to the spirit of our democracy and goes against the precedents that the Senate Majority Leader himself established in 2010 when he argued that Sen. Scott Brown should be able to fill the seat vacated by the death of Ted Kennedy immediately in order to help kill the Affordable Care Act. At that time, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) announced that so here we are, and now the rumors are that they will jam this proposal through the House of Representatives and then bypass what has always been the normal legislative process. Theres no reason to not follow normal legislative process in this case  except the craven majority leader doesnt want a moral Democrat sabotaging his precious tax scam that steals from the poor to give to the rich. If Doug Jones takes the seat he rightfully won by the end of the week, he and one Republican defection  perhaps Susan Collins (R-ME) or Rand Paul (R-KY)  could sink the Republican class warfare agenda entirely. Nor does he want a child molester and bigot keeping the public focused on Republican moral rot, which would lower the bills already sinking support. Instead, he wants appointee Luther Strange to stay and ram through the tax bill for their wealthy donors before anyone can stop them. Since Doug Jones won today and Mitch McConnell refuses to seat him, every Alabama voter  and indeed, every American, should take to the streets. If Republicans refuse to govern responsibly, Americans must make themselves ungovernable. Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the Presidents crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!"
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-say-kuwait-followed-his-lead-vi/,"Kuwait first placed a blanket ban on new visas for Syrians in 2011, but those already in the country were allowed to remain. (AFP/File)
Citizens from five Muslim-majority countries will no longer be able to obtain Kuwaiti visas, after reports the Gulf state issued tight entry restrictions that mirrored US President Donald Trump's Muslim ban.

Syrians, Iraqis, Iranians, Pakistanis and Afghans will not be able to obtain visit, tourism or trade Kuwaiti visas with the news coming one day after the US slapped its own restrictions on seven Muslim-majority countries.

Passport holders from the countries will no lot be allowed to enter the Gulf state while the blanket ban is in place and have been told not to apply to visas.

Kuwaiti sources told local media that the restrictions were in place due to the ""instability"" in the five countries and that the ban would be lifted once the security situation improves.

Pakistan and Afghanistan have all witnessed violence from extremist groups, while Syria and Iraq are embroiled in internal conflicts.

Although mainly peaceful, tensions between Iran and the Gulf have ratched up over the past year with the GCC powers accusing Tehran of attempting to destabalise the region.

Kuwait is concerned about the threat of extremist groups such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group with both militant organisations have a presence in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The Gulf state has witnessed a number of militant attacks over the past two years, including the bombing of a Shia mosque in 2015 which left 27 Kuwaits dead.

Kuwait responded by arresting dozens of suspected Daesh sympathizers and rolling out mandatary DNA testing programme and database for the Gulf state's 4 million population.

Kuwait reportedly issued a ban on all visas for Syrians in 2011, but allowed those inside the country to remain.

It made Kuwait the only country in the world to officially bar entry to Syrians, until the US named Syria in seven countries banned from entering.

Kuwait has issued a number of laws targeting foreigners in recent years, and made it one of the most unfriendly Gulf states towards expatriates.

In 2015, Kuwait was named as the worst place in the world for expatriates in a 64 country InterNations survey. 

Meanwhile, Trump's Muslim ban has been met with widespread outrage since it was signed on Friday, although Gulf states have remained quiet on the issue.

Dubai security chief Dhahi Khalfan outraged Syrians and other nationalities included in the ban when he publically backed Trump's decision."

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/27/louie-gohmert/protesters-are-paid-disrupt-town-hall-meetings-goh/,"TYLER, TX  - A group of demonstrators gathered Tuesday on the square in Tyler to push for immigration and health care reform. The group goes by Indivisible of Smith County and called for a town hall meeting with Rep. Louie Gohmert. Gohmert was dining at nearby Jack Ryan's during the demonstration. He responded Tuesday afternoon, issuing the following statement: The communication below is being sent to those constituents who have demanded a public town hall meeting mainly for the purpose of letting the Congressman know they want to keep Obamacare. Dear Fellow East Texans: Thank you for your recent request to my office for a town hall meeting. Having traveled the entirety of our district so many times during my time in Congress, doing thousands of events and public appearances, such as veterans ceremonies, hospice medal presentations, church sermons with meet/greet, job site tours, charity dinner talks, public hearings, speeches to big groups/small groups with question/answer time, constituent meetings, media interviews, op-eds, constituent phone calls, ribbon cuttings, business forums, job fairs, district art competitions, school assemblies, classroom caucuses, flag presentation ceremonies, VA clinic visits, business openings, environmental field hearings, chamber banquets, judicial conferences, farming symposia, rodeos, town meetings, big/small town hall meetings, tele-town hall meetings, as well as constituent meetings when in Washington, I feel confident there are very few voters who pay attention in the 1st Congressional District of Texas who dont know exactly where I stand on the issues and whyespecially regarding the issue of Obamacare. In fact, in November, over a quarter of a million people were polled, and 73.9% said they agreed with me. I made clear for the last seven years that I would do all I could to repeal Obamacare. I was one of the few who read it before I voted. Unfortunately, at this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety. Threats are nothing new to me and I have gotten my share as a felony judge. However, the House Sergeant at Arms advised us after former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot at a public appearance, that civilian attendees at Congressional public events stand the most chance of being harmed or killedjust as happened there. One Congressional friend had one of his district staff members knocked unconscious and hospitalized this past week after being overrun by a group intent on physical confrontation and disruption. In the same amount of time it takes to have a town hall meeting, which usually has between 30 and 100 attendees in east Texas, I can communicate with thousands of my constituent bosses through a telephone town hall meeting. This technology allows the inclusion of our disabled and more elderly seniors who have opinions but who could not otherwise come to an actual town hall meeting and ask questions. The telephone company assures us that all of the people participating on our telephone town halls live right here in east Texas and I will have likely have had over one hundred thousand people in our district participate by the time I finish this new round. Then, when the threat of violence at town hall meetings recedes, we can go back to having the civil town hall meetings Ive had in the past to supplement the masses reached in our telephone town halls. I very much appreciate hearing from the most vocal who form part of the very important twenty-six percent who disagreed with my seven year position on Obamacare, and I really believe that if we do the right things after repealing Obamacare, that even most of those who like government control of their lives in Obamacare, will acknowledge that things are better with more personal choices at a lower price, and without the massive cuts to Medicare and our seniors healthcare that Obamacare inflicted. Just this past week I have had two telephone town halls which included asking questions of constituents and getting those polling results that are absolutely consistent with the ultimate poll that was taken on Election Day just three and a half months ago. It should not be surprising that thus far, the results on the most politically sensitive issues show that the views I have been standing firm on are consistent with the 74% of voting east Texans that believed in November that I best reflected their beliefs and wishes. We have also noted that a manual from one of the groups demanding town halls so they can disrupt them with agitators, suggested such underhanded motivations such as: Stall the Trump agenda by forcing them to redirect energy away from their priorities. A day they spend worrying about you is a day that theyre not preparing a Muslim registry. (By the way, I do not support a Muslim registry!) Tactics for these events may be similar to more traditional protests, where youre trying to shift attention from the scheduled event to your own message. Statements like this in their community organizing materials are not non-partisan, as they their playbook tells them to claim that they are. Some public town halls from this particular group recently boasted having agitators even come in from other states to cause havoc. I understand you personally do not want violence, but just want to be heard. I hear you. As a servant of east Texas, your input continues to be vital to me. Thats why I put over 80,000 miles on my car in about two years repeatedly getting to every part of our east Texas district. So, thank you very much for your input. Though I am saddened if you are upset with my positions, they do appear to reflect a majority of east Texans views but I will continue to monitor closely. Regardless, I sincerely hope this week that you will find joy in the faces of those you love."

Listening to them, people would believe that the participants were sincere, spontaneous and concerned citizens. While some were genuine, most were paid minions. Renowned author, Asra Q Nomani, felt something was not right about the March for Womens Rights. Co-founder of the womens organization, Muslims for Peace, Nomani has an invested interest in womens rights. She champions peace and tolerance among the Muslim community, openly rejecting Islamic terrorism. Following her gut, Nomani decided to follow the money. She spent the weekend reviewing piles of documents regarding George Soros. Her findings are amazing. Nomani researched and discovered George Soros funded over 50 organizations partnering and participating in the March for Womens Rights. Part of that funding went straight into the protesters pockets. They werent there for rights. They were there for riches. Nomani reported her findings exposing the truth in the New York Times. By my draft research, which Im opening up for crowd-sourcing on GoogleDocs, Soros has funded, or has close relationships with, at least 56 of the marchs partners, including key partners Planned Parenthood, which opposes Trumps anti-abortion policy, and the National Resource Defense Council, which opposes Trumps environmental policies. The other Soros ties with Womens March organizations include the partisan MoveOn.org (which was fiercely pro-Clinton), the National Action Network (which has a former executive director lauded by Obama senior advisor Valerie Jarrett as a leader of tomorrow as a march co-chair and another official as the head of logistics). Other Soros grantees who are partners in the march are the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Constitutional Rights, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. March organizers and the organizations identified here havent yet returned queries for comment. On the issues I care about as a Muslim, the Womens March, unfortunately, has taken a stand on the side of partisan politics that has obfuscated the issues of Islamic extremism over the eight years of the Obama administration. Womens March partners include the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which has not only deflected on issues of Islamic extremism post-9/11, but opposes Muslim reforms that would allow women to be prayer leaders and pray in the front of mosques, without wearing headscarves as symbols of chastity. Partners also include the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which wrongly designated Maajid Nawaz, a Muslim reformer, an anti-Muslim extremist in a biased report released before the election. The SPLC confirmed to me that Soros funded its anti-Muslim extremists report targeting Nawaz. (Ironically, CAIR also opposes abortions, but its leader still has a key speaking role.) Another Soros grantee and march partner is the Arab-American Association of New York, whose executive director, Linda Sarsour, is a march co-chair. When I co-wrote a piece, arguing that Muslim women dont have to wear headscarves as a symbol of modesty, she attacked the coauthor and me as fringe. Linda Sarsour was one of the Marchs four organizers. She advocates Sharia Law, which rejects abortion. Yet, she is more comfortable standing with the terrorist group, Hamas, than marching with Pro-Life organizations. Appointed Obamas Champion of Change in 2012, Sarsour also attended the recent Democrat National Convention as a delegate. Yet the liberal media and pundits promote the march as nonpartisan. This is not a grassroots movement in any sense of the word. It is a well organized, well paid media show run by the ultimate puppet master. And the insanity is just beginning. For all their talk about unity, their actions speak louder than words. As much as we want to mock them and dismiss them, we have to be the adults. These spoiled, uneducated, manipulated children need to be taken by the hand before they take America completely off the deep end. But thats just my 2 cents."

The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. 
This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order.

Failed vice presidential candidate Kaine appeared on MSNBC in January urging Democrats to fight in the streets in resistance against the Trump agenda and the will of the American people. Theres so much going on here that we clearly see, you know, places where we can criticize what the administration is doing, but how does the [Democratic] party rebuild? asked host Mika Brzezinski. How do you prevent a continuation of the bubble in a situation like this, and how does the party reclaim its reach across the country while fighting these battles? So, the way we get outside the bubble is we take advantage of this tremendous public outcry against the administration, responded Kaine. What weve got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box, and now theres the momentum to be able to do this. Kaines son, Linwood, apparently heeded his fathers advice and would later be arrested while attempting to disrupt a pro-Trump rally in Minnesota, and is now facing criminal charges. When protesters began harassing people gathered at the Minnesota State Capitol, rally participants attempted to block the entrance to the rotunda where the rally was taking place, reported the Daily Caller. Protesters then tried to force their way down the stairs, using smoke bombs, mace and fireworks, and causing a need for some rally participants to be treated by paramedics. We love that our three children have their own views and concerns about current political issues, said Kaine in a statement on the matter. They fully understand the responsibility to express those concerns peacefully. Lynch also used similarly incendiary language in a bizarre one minute video in which she seemed to call upon fellow progressives to march, bleed, and die in the streets  also in resistance to the Trump agenda, which has been endorsed and Constitutionally mandated by the American people. I know its a time of concern for people, who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on and even being rolled back, she said. I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our Founding Fathers. It has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals who have made the difference. Theyve marched, theyve bled and yes, some of them died, she continued. This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before. We can do this again. These are only two examples out of a stunning collection of calls to violence and murder from the intolerant, unhinged leftists in the Democrat party, mainstream media, Hollywood, and the spiderweb of interwoven organizations and cabals like Antifa and Black Lives Matter who have effectively transformed into domestic terrorists in Trumps America.

A new scandal has happened after high ranking officials from the Chinese space program called the American moon landing “a complete hoax”, the Beijing Daily Express reports.

The claims came after the Chinese moon rover allegedly couldn’t find any proof of American landings on the Moon.

The rover took thousands of photos and after analyzing them the Chinese discovered that there’s no trace of these moon landings.

Now the Chinese space program has launched a petition, already signed by 200 of its high-ranking officials, demanding explanation from the US government and the release of classified NASA information which will finally put an end to all the speculations and give definitive proof of the American moon landings.

Or maybe it was just an elaborate hoax with the sole purpose to fool the world about its space program capabilities. Whatever the case they need to come forward and speak the truth.

The petition has been signed by world-renowned nuclear engineer, Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin, and numbers of other prominent Russian engineers and ex-KGB agents.

They’re all saying that the Russian government “has always been aware of the situation since the early 1970s”.

The claims are favored by conspiracy theorists who have tried to convince the public for decades that the USA hasn’t ever landed on the Moon.

The landing was just an elaborate plan to trick Russia into believing they are further ahead in the space race.

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/05/blog-posting/headlines-say-gop-bill-makes-sexual-assault-pre-ex/,"Republican legislators’ recent attempts at passing healthcare legislation has consistently penalized the poor and the elderly, but their latest incarnation will add a new target to the list: rape victims.

The bill’s MacArthur Meadows Amendment would allow states to permit insurance companies to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. Bizarrely, the term “pre-existing condition” applies to sexual assault, postpartum depression, C-sections, and victims of domestic violence.

While it’s important to note that this definition of pre-existing condition existed before Obamacare passed, no language in the MacArthur Meadows Amendment has changed this interpretation. Ironically, the Amendment itself states, “Nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to discriminate in rates for health insurance coverage by gender.”

“Back in 2010, it was legal in several states to deny somebody coverage because they were a domestic abuse survivor. That was considered a pre-existing condition,” said Dr. Diane Horvath-Cosper of Physicians for Reproductive Health. She added: “Most of the people who have C-sections identify as women, so that’s a shorthand for a gender discriminatory policy.”

Christina Turner, 45, was a victim of this policy before Obamacare’s passage. According to the Huffington Post, Turner’s potential insurance provider turned her away for taking anti-AIDS medication after being drugged and sexually assaulted.

“I’m going to be penalized my whole life because of this,” she said at the time.

HuffPo also reported on an insurance company who refused to pay for a woman’s rape exam because “she had been raped before.”

Under Trumpcare, rape victims would also be unable to obtain coverage for preventative coverage like mammograms and gynecological exams, a matter which at least one Republican senator seemed to find funny last month, quipping “I wouldn’t want to lose my mammograms.”  (After intense media pressure, he later apologized.)

The new bill also continues previous iterations’ legacy of targeting Planned Parenthood and restricting access to contraceptive care, a policy which the Congressional Budget office estimates will ultimately cost the country approximately $21 billion worth of Medicaid to cover the spike in new births for Medicaid patients.

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/14/blog-posting/no-washington-post-roy-moore-reporter-doesnt-have-/,"On October 1, 2011, the Washington Posts Stephanie McCrummen authored a story for publication in the Post concerning Texas Governor Perrys lease of a hunting spot with an offensive name. Although a careful read of the story shows that there is no substantiation for the allegations of racism, Ms. McCrummen, the Post, and MSNBC have held a non-stop witch hunt, accusing Mr. Perry of everything under the sun. So, lets examine the author using the same journalistic standards practiced by the Washington Post. Ms. McCrummen has a rather interesting criminal history herself, as public criminal records in multiple states stretching across 4 time zones have shown. Ms. McCrummens criminal history began with North Carolina Case # 1992 CR 00654, a violation of the Article 19  False Pretenses and Cheats section of the North Carolina Criminal Code. Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless. In 2005, the apparently unrepentant Ms. McCrummen was again found guilty in the 2005 Virginia Case #059GT0504714900 for failing to obey a highway sign. The following year, McCrummen was found guilty in yet another Virginia criminal case, #153GT0604021200, speeding 46 miles an hour in a 25 mile speed zone. Last year, in August, 2010, Ms. McCrummen was found guilty in Arizona Case # M-07510TR-2010025209 of speeding once again. She plead guilty but failed to pay the fine imposed by the court and returned to Washington having skipped out on paying her fine to the criminal court. A collection review was held in September, after she had escaped Arizonas jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction. McCrummen has now found herself a four-time loser in the states criminal courts. She currently resides outside of the jurisdiction of the three states where she committed her crimes. As you can see from this simple outline of Ms. Stephanie McCrummens past, under the Posts journalistic standards, it is pretty easy to throw mud on someone even if they didnt do anything truly wrong. Over the years, the journalistic standards of the Washington Post have fallen into a death spiral of innuendo and name calling, as seen in McCrummens ni**erhead story. They can create guilt out of thin air as we have in the public records concerning the Post Staff Writer in question. The Post should quit its despicable methodology of reporting the news. For now, Ms. McCrummen and the Post owe Governor Perry an apology. Mike Robinson is Sr. Partner at Robinson & Henry P.C., a Castle Rock, CO Law Firm. Ph. 303-688-0944."

Markey (D-Mass.) released the following statement after President Donald Trump announced this afternoon that he is declaring a public health emergency in response to the nations ongoing opioid epidemic. However, the President did not request any emergency funding from Congress to address this growing epidemic, which caused more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, a number that is anticipated to be higher for 2016. In fact, the President announced he would reallocate funding from HIV/AIDS programs for substance use disorder treatment. Yesterday, Senators Markey and Bob Casey (D-Penn.) introduced the Combatting the Opioid Epidemic Act, which would invest $45 billion for prevention, detection, monitoring, and treatment of opioids. This summer, Senate Republicans proposed providing that same amount for the crisis as part of their Better Care Reconciliation Act. America is hemorrhaging lives by the day because of the opioid epidemic, but President Trump offered the country a Band-Aid when we need a tourniquet. Todays announcement is nothing more than a dog-and-pony show in an attempt to demonstrate the Trump administration is not ignoring this crisis. Instead of a commitment to emergency funding for our states and communities, President Trump offered empty words and half measures. We need continued and reliable long-term investments in prevention, treatment, and monitoring to address this scourge. Thats why Ive introduced legislation to invest $45 billion to combat the opioid crisis, and I call on Congressional Republican leadership to bring this legislation to the floor. We need recovery services, not President Trumps lip service. Additionally, the Administrations proposal to reallocate funding from HIV/AIDS programs to the opioid crisis is robbing Peter to pay Paul, especially as HIV and AIDS rates spike due to increased heroin and fentanyl use. A wall at our border will do nothing to stop the flow drugs across our border. Instead, we need to equip our border agents with advanced scanning equipment that can identify and stop heroin and illicit fentanyl from entering the country. We also need to mandate all prescribers receive education about opioid painkillers and how to responsibly prescribe them. We need better data collection through the Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. We need to enforce mental health parity. And we need to hold Big Pharma accountable for flooding our communities with addictive opioid painkillers. The Trump administration formula for the opioid crisis is clear: empty words, broken promises and no real action. I will continue to fight for the resources Massachusetts and all states need to combat this national emergency. In August, Senator Markey called on President Trump to declare a national public health emergency to help the federal government respond to the prescription and illicit opioid overdose crisis, as recommended by the Presidents Commission. A month later, Senator Markey led a group of ten Senators in querying the President about his delay in making the declaration and other actions his administration planned to take to respond to this public health crisis. On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed companion legislation to the International Narcotics Trafficking Emergency Response by Detecting Incoming Contraband with Technology (INTERDICT) Act, legislation Senator Markey introduced to equip the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to detect and interdict illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioids at the borders. He also has introduced legislation to mandate education for opioid prescribers and increase transparency on opioid quotas produced by manufacturers. ###"
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/15/kris-kobach/there-evidence-voter-fraud-new-hampshire-kris-koba/,"For years, the mainstream media has ignored the problem of voter fraud and belittled those of us who are trying to do something about it. And when secretaries of state like me identify cases of fraud, we are told that the number of incidents of voter fraud is too insignificant to matter. Now, however, facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshires U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshires four electoral college votes in the presidential election. New Hampshire is one of fifteen states that allow same-day voter registration. The benefit of same-day registration is that it allows a person who has procrastinated or has forgotten to register to nonetheless cast a ballot on election day. The downside of same-day registration is that it does not allow the state time to assess the eligibility of the voter. A volunteer poll worker simply accepts a modicum of identification and takes the voter at his word that hes a U.S. citizen resident of the state who is eligible to vote. New Hampshire is also a battleground state. Unlike neighboring Massachusetts and Vermont, which reliably vote for the Democrat in presidential elections, New Hampshire can swing either way. It has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshires same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes. Now theres proof. According to statistics released by the Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, on the date of the general election in November 2016, there were 6,540 same-day registrants who registered to vote in New Hampshire using an out-of-state drivers license to prove their identity. In and of itself, that doesnt prove that any fraud occurred  theoretically, each of those individuals could have been someone who recently moved to the State and had not yet had time to get a New Hampshire drivers license. According to New Hampshire law, a new resident has 60 days to obtain a New Hampshire drivers license. So if those 6,540 voters were bona fide New Hampshire residents, they would get their drivers license no later than January 7, 2017. However, the numbers tell a very different story. It turns out that, as of August 30, 2017  nearly ten months after the election  only 1,014 of the 6,540 same-day registrants who registered with an out-of-state license had obtained a New Hampshire drivers license. The other 5,526 individuals never obtained a New Hampshire drivers license. And, of those 5,526, only 213 registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. So 5,313 of those voters neither obtained a New Hampshire drivers license nor registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. They have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding drivers licenses, and it appears that they are not actually residing in New Hampshire. It seems that they never were bona fide residents of the State. 5,513 is a big number  more than enough to swing two very important elections. The closest major election was the contest between incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte and challenger Maggie Hassan (D). Hassan won the election by a razor-thin margin of 1,017 votes. Those 5,313 fraudulent votes were more than enough to swing the election. If 59.2 percent or more of them went for Hassan, then the election was stolen through voter fraud. Thats likely, since the surrounding states are Democrat strongholds. Its also possible that New Hampshires four electoral college votes were swung to Hillary Clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents. Clinton won New Hampshire by only 2,732 votes. If 74.8 percent of the 5,513 fraudulent votes were cast for Clinton, then the presidential election in New Hampshire was tipped as well. If the presidential contest had been closer and had come down to a margin of three or four electoral college votes, then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences. Regardless, in the Senate contest, it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result. And that is already having consequences for the nation. If the 52-48 Republican-Democrat balance in the Senate were 53-47, it could change the balance in any number of votes  not the least of which would be the effort to repeal Obamacare. But the mainstream media will tell us, Move along, theres nothing to see here. Kris W. Kobach is the elected Secretary of State of Kansas. An expert in immigration law and policy, he coauthored the Arizona SB-1070 immigration law and represented in federal court the 10 ICE agents who sued to stop Obamas 2012 executive amnesty.

Harry Reids handpicked candidate, Jacky Rosen, has promised to join Nancy Pelosi and repeal the middle class tax cut that is already leading to higher wages, bonuses, bigger paychecks, and more job opportunities. Watch the ad here. Since President Trump signed the historic bill into law, over 500 companies have announced their plans expand employee benefits because of tax reform. The new Heller ad highlights a few of the Nevada employers  Apple, AT&T, Waste Management, and Tesla. Just yesterday, the Kroger Company, which owns grocery stores across Nevada, announced they would invest their tax savings in their employees with higher wages, expanding their education-assistance program, and increasing their 401K match. The ad also showcases locally owned companies that are using their tax cut to create jobs and award employees. The developers of the stalled-Fontainebleau resortrecently renamed the Drew on the Las Vegas Strip announced they will complete the project, which will create more than 10,000 jobs in Southern Nevada. And South Point Hotel, Casino, and Spa doubled their bonuses for workers. These benefits are just the beginning for Nevada families. With new lower rates taking effect, as well as a doubling of the child tax credit thanks to Sen. Dean Hellers leadership, Nevadans will be keeping more of their hard-earned money unless Pelosi and Rosen get their way. Rosen has repeatedly shown she is out-of-touch with Nevadas middle class. She has stuck to Pelosis talking points by calling bigger paychecks crumbs, and has recklessly promised to repeal these middle class tax cuts. Our latest ad highlights the biggest difference between Dean Heller and Jacky Rosen, Heller campaign spokesman Keith Schipper said. While Sen. Heller fights for Nevada families, Jacky Rosen will always sell out Nevadans if it pleases her party bosses."

The legislation was introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and had bi-partisan support. Democrats Joe Manchin, Joe Donnelly, and Bob Casey voted for the bill. For what its worth, polling done by the Susan B. Anthony List (a pro-life organization) suggested that 56 percent of North Dakotans supported the legislation. But Heitkamp voted to kill it, and it failed 51-46. Just after casting her no vote, Senator Heitkamp could be seen on the Senate floor high-fiving Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer: You can bet that Republicans are going to make some hay out of that visual. Will this hurt Heitkamp? Its hard to say. On one hand, North Dakota is traditionally thought of as a pro-life state. On the other hand, when pro-life issues have been put on the ballot in recent years they havent done very well. Perhaps Heitkamp thinks North Dakotans are on her side of this issue. Or, at least, ambivalent enough about it that it wont sway their vote in the Senate race. Of course, a 20-week ban isnt all that radical. In Roe vs. Wade the Supreme Court made viability of the unborn child outside the womb an important legal consideration. At 20 weeks the survival rateisnt very good. But thats a moving target. As medical technology and techniques improve that viability number is going to get earlier and earlier. But beyond the viability question, pregnancy is usually detectable by the 4-6 week period. A 20-week ban allows for plenty of time for a woman to make a decision as to whether or not to terminate a pregnancy. Which is probably why about 6 in 10 Americans supported a 20 week abortion ban in 2017 according to this Marist poll. Share this: Twitter Facebook Google LinkedIn Reddit Tumblr"

Glenn Simpson, who cofounded the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, told lawmakers that a trip Trump Organization representatives took to Moscow several years ago had come onto the firm's radar as part of their research into Trump's business history. 
                                       The trip was organized by Sergei Millian, Simpson said.

http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/apr/15/naral-pro-choice-america/naral-virginia-says-90-percent-health-care-policie/,"Late last night, Governor Bob McDonnell submitted an amendment to both HB 1900 and SB921, legislation to implement the Virginia health benefits exchange as set out under the Affordable Care Act. McDonnell’s amendment prohibits Virginians participating in the new health exchange from purchasing any insurance plan that includes coverage for abortion – coverage that currently exists as a standard benefit in nearly 90 percent of private plans sold in the U.S.

If passed by the General Assembly, this extreme measure will block thousands of women from purchasing affordable and comprehensive health care with their own private dollars, and could rob many Virginians of benefits they currently possess through their private health care plans.

Caroline O’Shea, deputy director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, strongly condemned McDonnell’s abortion ban amendment:

""With this amendment, Governor McDonnell is once again attempting to intrude in women’s health care decisions and block Virginians access to the critical medical care they need. Coverage for safe, legal abortion care - a procedure an estimated one in three women will access in their lifetimes - is a basic benefit that most insurance plans currently include. By banning women from using their own funds to purchase plans that include this common benefit, Governor McDonnell is restricting Virginians’ personal economic decisions as well as their access to comprehensive care.

State employees and other Virginians who get their health insurance through the government already have their coverage for abortion care unfairly restricted – but that’s not enough for Governor McDonnell. He wants to extend this intrusion into the lives of women with private insurance as well.
The Affordable Care Act is intended to help thousands of uninsured or underinsured Virginians find and purchase affordable health insurance coverage. But thanks to Gov. McDonnell, thousands of Virginia women could find their coverage slashed – not enhanced. It is outrageous that, like Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli’s ongoing crusade against coverage for affordable contraception (a fight he infamously deemed worthy of going to jail over), Governor McDonnell’s amendment would restrict private economic interactions in order to advance an extreme anti-choice agenda. With this move, Gov. McDonnell is extending the heavy hand of government even further – beyond women’s bedrooms and into their wallets.



If Virginians had somehow forgotten about Governor McDonnell’s outright contempt for women’s rights and personal decision-making, this attack on private coverage for abortion will certainly remind them.”

Governor McDonnell’s abortion coverage ban amendment will go before the General Assembly when the veto session begins on April 3rd.

Virginia General Assembly have taken the important step to protect the taxpayers of
Virginia from being forced to pay for abortions in insurance plans under the newly created
federal health care exchanges. During today’s veto session the Senate voted 20 to 19 in
favor of the amendment sent down from pro-life Governor Bob McDonnell. The same
amendment passed in the House of Delegates 55 to 37.
.
Gov. McDonnell’s amendment is respectful of where most Virginians and
Americans stand on the question of taxpayer funding of abortions. The amendment is an
extension of existing law that prevents Virginia tax funds from paying for abortion in any
insurance plans sold under the new federal health care law. The original law passed in
2011 was set to expire in July 1, 2014.
Federal law allows the states to create protective provisions such as the one
contained in the Governor’s amendment. The amendment does not prevent an individual
from using their own resources to obtain an abortion. It simply insures that insurance
plans sold in Virginia and funded with public monies will not pay for abortions on
demand.
“Without this amendment, starting in 2014 Virginians would have been forced to
pay for all abortions on demand done in the Commonwealth through the new federal
health care law. Virginia taxpayers owe a debt of gratitude to Governor McDonnell and
the General Assembly for taking this reasonable action today.” said Olivia Gans Turner,

Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is infamous for having said that Congress had to pass the bill so you can find out what's in it. Well, they passed it. We now know whats in it, and the American people dont like it. So far, what the President promised hasnt come true. President Obama promised in a speech before Congress that his health care proposal would not add to the national deficit, but the Government Accountability Office estimated that it will add to the long-term deficit by $6.2 trillion. The Administration promised that premium rates would go down, but the Energy and Commerce Committee released a report just this week revealing that consumers premiums could spike as high as 400 percent. In Virginia, the small group market is projected to increase by 31 percent. CLASS, the laws long-term care program, was determined to be financially unsustainable and has been suspended. Furthermore, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is now soliciting funds for the laws implementation from the very same companies and groups that her agency is responsible for overseeing, because they underestimated the cost of implementation. Even with a stack of regulations taller than I am, the Administration cannot tell the American people what will happen with their health insurance in January when Obamacare is fully implemented. Why? Because the Administration still has more decisions to make, and more regulations to promulgate. Senator Max Baucus, one of the laws main architects, recently described Obamacare as a huge train wreck coming down. We have a chance to save Americans from being casualties of the train wreck. We can yank them off the tracks. Today, my vote shows that I am doing what I can to do just that. I call on the United States Senate to join us in rescuing the American people from the tracks of health care destruction. ###"
http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/oct/04/jim-moran/moran-says-obamacare-has-reined-growth-health-care/,"Washington, DC – Congressman Jim Moran, Northern Virginia Democrat, applauded the Department of Health and Human Service’s (HHS) new report released today showing that 6.8 million consumers have saved an estimated $1.2 billion on health insurance premiums in 2012 due to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

“Rising health care costs have handicapped consumers and choked family budgets.  Thankfully that growth has been reined in through the Affordable Care Act (ACA),” said Rep. Moran.   “The rate review provision, which has been responsible for these savings, prevents insurance companies from unfairly raising consumers’ premiums in order to simply pad their bottom lines.”

New federal rate review rules under the ACA require insurance companies to submit any proposed health insurance premium greater than 10 percent for federal approval. This provision was put in place in 2011.

The ACA also requires insurance companies to devote 80 percent of premium dollars to health care, not administrative costs or overhead.  Last year, to comply with the 80 percent threshold companies lowered premium costs by $3.4 billion.  Companies in violation returned an additional $500 million to consumers.

This issue, and many others related to the ACA, will be discussed at the Congressman’s upcoming community forum entitled “Navigating the Affordable Care Act: Making Health Reform Work for You and Your Family” on September 16th at 7:00PM at TC Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia.

http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2014/may/11/thomas-garrett-jr/sen-tom-garrett-says-medicaid-fraud-unit-virginia-/,"RECENTLY, Democrat Dick Saslaw said ""opposing Medicaid expansion is crazy,"" and ""the reason for opposition is hatred of a black president."" Nothing says desperation like the abandonment of any coherent argument.

Democrats think that voters are so ill-informed that this rhetoric will win, but I have more respect for our voters than that. With this in mind, several of the innumerable reasons why Medicaid expansion would be disastrous for Virginia are listed below.

First, we don't need to expand Medicaid; Medicaid expands itself. Here are the numbers: a 1,600 percent increase in Virginia's Medicaid spending in 30 years. Second, 20 years ago, Medicaid was 6 percent of the budget. Two years ago, Medicaid accounted for 21 percent (and this occurred while the budget itself was exploding). Simply put, Medicaid is the largest unfunded federal mandate that there is.

Secondly, Medicaid is so fundamentally broken that expanding it would be like bailing out a sinking boat by adding water. Medicaid has been audited over 60 times in 10 years because we know that the program is bleeding money. Yet Democrats insist on this vehicle to further the broken promises of Obama-Care, knowing fully that it is hemorrhaging our money already.

Before I was in the Senate, I worked in the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU). Here are the numbers. Annually, Medicaid loses an estimated $38 billion to fraud. To put that in perspective, that is three-quarters of what Virginia spends in a year. Three quarters of every dollar spent on K-12, higher education, transportation, public safety and law enforcement combined; and that's not the waste and abuse just fraud. Last year, the MFCU in Virginia alone recovered over $200 million! How can expanding this be a good idea?

In fact, last year we lost more money in Medicaid fraud than we spent nationally on Temporary Aid to Needy Families. Seriously, Medicaid loses more in fraud annually than we spend on welfare. And this is the Democrat plan to cover the uninsured?

He argued in his book that ""a more rational approach...is to use the tax code to gain compliance"" to have people buy health insurance, and in 2007 he was paid $300,000 to be the front man for a coalition that made the individual mandate the centerpiece of its health reform plan. However, just last week, Gillespie's campaign reversed course and claimed that he ""consistently opposed the mandates.""

Sound familiar?

Gillespie's rendezvous with Romney in New York City seems appropriate on this first day of the Virginia General Assembly special session for one more reason: the Virginia GOP is advocating against expanding Medicaid - despite it being a policy Gillespie strongly supported in 2007.

""Ed Gillespie and Mitt Romney are two peas in a pod when it comes to flip flopping on health reform,"" said DPVA spokeswoman Ashley Bauman. ""The fact that Gillespie so easily abandons his previous support for the individual mandate and expanding Medicaid shows that he will say anything to get elected.""

BACKGROUND

ROMNEY REPEATEDLY SAID HIS MASSACHUSETTS PLAN WOULD BE “A MODEL FOR THE NATION”

2007: Romney Said That The Massachusetts Plan “Will Be A Model For The Nation.” “During a speech in Baltimore on Feb. 2, 2007, Romney outlined his ambitions for the Massachusetts plan. ‘I’m proud of what we’ve done,’ he said. ‘If Massachusetts succeeds in implementing it, then that will be a model for the nation.’ Last month Romney’s dream came true. If Republicans knew what was good for them, they would stop treating it as a nightmare.” [Newsweek, 4/16/10]




ROMNEYCARE OFFICIALS HELPED WITH THE CREATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

White House Visitor Logs Show A Dozen Meetings In 2009 With Three Health-Care Advisers And Experts Who Helped Shape RomneyCare In 2006 Including One In The Oval Office With President Obama. NBC wrote on Romney’s health care advisors, advising the White House on health care reform: “The records, gleaned from White House visitor logs reviewed by NBC News, show that senior White House officials had a dozen meetings in 2009 with three health-care advisers and experts who helped shape the health care reform law signed by Romney in 2006, when the Republican presidential candidate was governor of Massachusetts. One of those meetings, on July 20, 2009, was in the Oval Office and presided over by President Barack Obama, the records show.” [NBC,10/11/11]

ROMNEYCARE WAS THE MODEL FOR OBAMACARE 


Headline: “Romneycare Was ‘Template’ For Obamacare” [James Pethokoukis, American Enterprise Institute, 1/26/12]

Politifact Rated The Claim That Obamacare Was Patterned After Romneycare, “True.” “Pawlenty said that ‘Obamacare was patterned after Mitt's plan in Massachusetts.’ In rating that statement, we noticed that Pawlenty phrased his statement carefully. He didn't say it was the same plan, but instead said that the national law was ‘patterned’ after the Massachusetts law, and they had ‘substantial similarities.’ He's correct that the plans, thought not completely identical, are very similar in structure. They both require everyone to have health insurance or pay a penalty; they both leave the current insurance system in place; they both expand coverage for the uninsured through subsidies or Medicaid. Because his statement accurately categorized the plans as similar -- but not exactly the same -- we rate Pawlenty's statement True.” [PolitiFact, 8/12/11]

GILLESPIE ARGUED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WHEN HE WAS PAID

 

2006: Gillespie’s Memoir Promotes An Individual Health Care Mandate, And Recommends That It Be  Enforced By The IRS Through The Income Tax Code. “A more rational approach is to ensure that every emancipated adult capable of providing for his or her health care do so. One way to accomplish this is to use the tax code to gain compliance.” [Gillespie memoir, Winning Right: Campaign Politics and Conservative Policies, (2006, Threshold Editions), pages 245-6]

2007: Gillespie’s Lobbying Firm was Paid More Than $300,000 By The Coalition To Advance Healthcare Reform, A Business And Insurance Coalition Launched With The Stated Goal Of Requiring An Individual And Employer Health Insurance Mandate. The news release announcing the Coalition highlighted Gillespie’s role both as a strategist and a participant, and the Coalition’s mailing address was the same as Gillespie’s D.C. lobbying firm.  “Standing shoulder to shoulder with lawmakers at a Capitol Hill press conference, [CAHR] discussed the coalition's core principles, its mission and called for meaningful federal and state policy reforms by 2009 to solve the nation's healthcare crisis… Specifically, the coalition believes the foundation of any reform must be based on the following: Universal Coverage with Individual Responsibility.”[PRNewswire, 05/07/2007]

2007: The Coalition’s Website Clearly Stated That The Individual Mandate Was A Key Principle. “Public policy has long mandated that care be provided when needed. We believe this policy should be balanced with a requirement that individuals carry health insurance regardless of their employment status.” [CAHR website archive,accessed 02/24/2014]

GILLESPIE BELIEVED LOW INCOME FAMILIES SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIES TO PAY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

2007: In A Radio Interview Supporting The Coalition’s Launch, Gillespie Said Low-Income Families Should Be Eligible For Taxpayer Subsidies To Help Pay For The Cost Of The Individual Mandate. Gillespie told Tom Ashbrook of WBUR/Boston’s “On Point” on May 8, 2007, “That’s not to say people shouldn’t be eligible for Medicaid or some form of government subsidies.” [Gillespie, WBUR Boston’s On Point, 5/8/2007]

Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section. He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but its hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the students rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.

Under Wisconsin law there are no privacy protections for those who sign a recall petition. Those who sign a recall petition must give their name, address, and the date that they signed the document. That information could be given or sold to any political or business entity wanting a list of individuals who are opposed to Governor Scott Walker or are likely opposed to any of the reforms that he has put in place. More ominously, someone could use the guise of the recall to gather information from complete strangers and then, with no intention of actually turning the petitions in, use that data to stalk individuals with the intent of carrying out a crime. Petition circulators are not required to register with the GAB or be certified as legitimate circulators. This stands in contrast to the practice of some municipalities to require individuals to receive certification as special registration deputies in order to register people to vote. When asked if there was anything to prevent political opponents, potential crooks, or businesses from lifting information off of recall petitions and using it for private, malicious or criminal purposes, the Government Accountability Board admitted that no protections exist. There is no restriction on how recall petition information may be used, Reid Magney, spokesman for the GAB told Media Trackers on Thursday morning. That the information is available even after the petitions are filed is due to the fact that recall petitions are a matter of public record. The complete lack of privacy protections is concerning to some people, particularly women. Mary Jo Baas, of Liberty House Consulting, said, I would be afraid to sign any recall petition that could be accessed by anyone and was circulated by someone with no real accountability. She went on to say, I wouldnt want my personal information, connected with my signature and political preferences, available to just anyone. Yet the connecting of all that personal information is exactly what happens in a Wisconsin recall election where petitions may be circulated by anyone and when the information on those petitions may be freely used for any purpose. Before signing a recall petition, Wisconsin citizens would do well to check the credibility of the circulator while remembering that there is nothing to prevent someone from using their personal information for a malicious or annoying purpose. Individuals looking for easy targets of criminal endeavors could find a wealth of information on recall petitions while annoying businesses and unscrupulous scammers could save themselves a lot of time and effort by simply abusing the information made public by petition signers.

http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/13/scott-suder/majority-leader-scott-suder-says-letter-four-assem/,"Project thwarted by Assembly Dems had already received DNR approval

Madison – Late this week, Missouri based Bass Pro Shops announced they would no longer be building one of their stores in Green Bay amid unfounded criticism from several Democrats in the State Assembly. Despite the Democrat’s best efforts, Assembly Majority Leader Scott Suder (R-Abbotsford) stressed on Friday that Assembly Republicans are committed to rectifying the situation and bringing jobs to Wisconsin.

“This fight is far from over,” said Suder. “Assembly Republicans remain committed to delivering what voters demanded last November, and that is jobs.”

The project, which had already been approved by the State Department of Natural Resources, would have brought hundreds of jobs to northeast Wisconsin at a time when the area is struggling with near double-digit unemployment. According to Bass Pro Shops, each store employs 300 full time employees, and the building of their facilities requires hundreds of construction jobs.

“Liberal Democrats in Madison scored a death blow to northeast Wisconsin’s economy by winning a battle for the far left agenda,” said Suder. “It is shameful that a handful of lawmakers—none of whom represent the district where the store was to be built—have successfully kept hundreds of struggling Wisconsinites from getting back on their feet and finding work.”

On Thursday, Democrat Reps. Brett Hulsey (Madison), Louis Molepske (Stevens Point), Chris Danou (Trempeleau), and Nick Milroy (South Ridge) wrote a letter to the founder and CEO of Bass Pro Shops, Inc., urging them to keep their store and their hundreds of jobs out of Wisconsin.

Despite contentions from the Democrats that the development would destroy wetlands, even the DNR has said that this project would replace 1.3 acres of wetland that could be overrun with noxious weeds in the near future with nearly 4 acres of new wetlands. In fact, the DNR’s own wetlands specialist classified the development as a “functional improvement” project enhancing the environment.

“For the past four weeks, we have seen Assembly Democrats do everything in their power to slow down Republican efforts to create jobs and help our economy recover,” said Suder. “When they pull these stunts on the floor, it just takes time; when they do it in the real world, it kills jobs and hurts real families.”

According to Bass Pro Shops, more than 100 million consumers visit their 56 stores annually. When the outdoor giant decided to open a store in Harlingen, TX, the Harlingen Economic Development Corporation estimated that the facility would generate more than 2,000 jobs and produce $26.4 million in sales tax revenue within the first ten years of business.

“Apparently Assembly Democrats are more concerned with staying in the spotlight via the politics of destruction than they are with helping Wisconsin families and workers,” said Suder. “While the Democrats and their environmentalist allies are gloating for killing jobs, Republicans are moving full speed ahead with a jobs agenda to send the message that Wisconsin is Open for Business. This is just the latest, and perhaps the most despicable example, of why the voters rebelled against the Democrats last November.”"
http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/09/national-federation-independent-business-wiscons/national-federation-independent-business-says-wisc/,"MADISON (January 4, 2011) – The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) today said that its members are highly encouraged by the Governor’s call for legal reforms aimed at discouraging baseless lawsuits and jackpot jury awards.
 
""The impact of a single lawsuit on small business can be devastating,"" said Bill G. Smith, State Director. ""Costly litigation or even the threat of litigation almost certainly means the loss of jobs and less job growth. We commend Governor Walker for taking immediate action to restore a litigation climate that will help encourage job creation while restoring fairness, and reduce the cost of Wisconsin's civil justice system.”
 
Smith noted that Wisconsin has one of the most promiscuous tort systems in the country in which small businesses are easy targets for baseless lawsuits and civil penalties that are entirely disproportionate.
 
“It is an impediment to business and job growth and it needs to be reformed as part of a larger economic plan,” said Smith.
 
Immediately upon taking office newly-elected Governor Scott Walker called the Legislature into special session to deal with the state’s economic crisis. He urged lawmakers to include tort reform as one of their priorities.
 
Smith, who is also President of the Wisconsin Civil Justice Council, a group seeking common-sense legal reforms, said he is hopeful that the special session may produce reforms that small businesses have long supported. They include:
 
Product Liability Reform – Legislation to protect small businesses from being penalized for selling products determined to be defective as the result of an unrelated manufacturer’s negligence. The bill is aimed at protecting retailers who are often dragged into product liability cases simply because they have assets or insurance. 
Elimination of “Risk Contribution” – Wisconsin is the only state in the country that recognizes so-called risk contribution theory, under which manufacturers can be penalized not on the basis of direct negligence but on their respective share of a market for a defective product. The bill would bring Wisconsin into line with virtually every other jurisdiction in which liability is assigned to responsible parties.
Expert Opinion – Unlike most states Wisconsin does not require that expert testimony be grounded in data, facts or reliable scientific principles.   The bill would impose such standards to ensure against unfair verdicts based on questionable testimony.
Punitive Damages – The bill would reverse a 2005 state Supreme Court decision that loosened the standards for punitive damages despite a law enacted by the Legislature in 1995 that sought to tighten the standards.
 
“These reforms would make the system fairer and more predictable for small businesses,” said Smith. “We are extremely pleased that the Governor and the new Legislature have acknowledged the need for legal reform as a way to boost the economy.”

And we learned just last night that their disastrous budget that will cut millions from our schools and universities.

In 60 days you can take Wisconsin back by recalling the Republican Senators who have decided to push Scott Walker’s divisive attack on the rights of workers and his assault on schools, universities and local communities. Can you contribute $60 today to support the Democratic Party’s recall efforts?

Make no mistake, these Republican Senators are vulnerable to recall for their radical partisan overreach. Senator Randy Hopper won his last election by just 184 votes. And Alberta Darling won her last race by only 1,007. By recalling just three of the eight Senators we are targeting, we can regain control of the Senate.

But we need your help today. The clock is ticking and we have just 60 days to collect the signatures we need to force a recall. Every day and every dollar counts.

Scott Walker’s Republican allies in the Senate have stood by for days while Walker has refused to negotiate on his partisan power grab disguised as a budget repair bill. Walker and his allies had no intention of listening to the people. That’s why Republicans unplugged the state legislative hotline for the first time in years.

Yesterday we saw the Republicans for who they are. A party so indebted to the Koch brothers and big business that they will raise taxes on our poorest families by $41 million dollars and push our schools and communities to the breaking point. Republican Senators have applauded even as Walker proposes to end the state’s decades old recycling program, showing that they will do anything in their power to harm our environment.

Please, contribute $60 to help us recall the Republican Senators who have decided to push Scott Walker’s extreme partisan agenda that has already put worker rights at risk and now is targeting our children, families and communities.
If we can recall at least three Senators and regain control of the Senate, we can end the ugly games Republicans in the legislature have played in the last few days — unplugging phone lines, bolting windows inside the Capitol shut, and withholding the paychecks of Democratic legislators.

By recalling Republican Senators in the next 60 days and retaking the Senate, Democrats will be able to push harder than ever for Wisconsin workers and families and fight back against Walker and his Republican allies.

Sincerely,

Mike Tate
Chair, Democratic Party of Wisconsin

P.S. — Republicans made it clear whose side they are on when they refused to lift a finger to save collective bargaining, even after workers offered all the financial concessions sought by Scott Walker.

http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/18/scott-keyes/left-leaning-think-tank-writer-says-green-bay-pack/,"As the NFL begins a new season this weekend, America will celebrate the sport not just as a wonderful national pastime, but also as a prime example of progressive policies in action. Weve cataloged seven unique ways in which the NFL is strengthened by its progressive approach to the sport, including equality, fairness, and diversity: 1. Revenue sharing: Fifty years ago, NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle set the NFL on a strong progressive path by implementing a system of revenue sharing between the teams. In essence, revenue from the leagues massive TV and radio contracts is divided evenly amongst the 32 NFL teams today. As a result, smaller market teams like the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings are able to stay competitive with big market teams like the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants. Advertisement 2. Salary cap: The NFL currently sets a team salary cap at $120 million. This prevents teams with wealthy owners from simply purchasing all the best players in the league, as the New York Yankees have done in Major League Baseball. As a result of the salary cap, the NFL enjoys much more equality, competition, and fairness than it would if owners were permitted to field teams with as high a salary as they pleased. 3. Strong unions: One primary reason there was an extended lockout during the offseason was because NFL players enjoy a strong union that did not back down in the face of new demands from the owners. Indeed, over the past few decades, the National Football League Players Association has used collective bargaining to win such concessions from owners as free agency, pension and health care improvements, and minimum salaries. 4. Affirmative action: Since 2003, the NFL has enforced the Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching vacancies. The impact has been undeniable; the percentage of minority coaches increased from 6 percent to 22 percent over the past eight years. Among these new leaders are some of the most successful coaches in the league, including Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin and Chicago Bears coach Lovie Smith, both of whom who have taken their teams to the Super Bowl. 5. Progressive draft system: At the end of every season, the league awards the first pick in next years draft to the team with the worst record, followed by the second worst, and so on. By taking a progressive approach to the distribution of draft picks, the NFL fosters competitiveness and parity among the teams. This has allowed teams like the 2008 Atlanta Falcons to make the playoffs under the leadership of a star rookie one year after having the third worst record in the league. 6. Schedule equalizing: Just as the worst-performing teams are given a boost in the draft, so too are the following years schedules tweaked to improve equality. In other words, the better a team does in one season, the more difficult their schedule will be the following season. This focus on equality makes the NFL far more exciting than a league dominated by a static group of elite teams."

Scott Walkers unaccountable WEDC has faced problems since its sloppy inception. In September 2012, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development suspended the states Community Development Block Grant program, citing WEDCs ineligibility to administer such funds as they were not an instrumentality of the state. As recently as October, Scott Walker stated that, I want to make it clear that overwhelmingly the staff of the WEDC is doing a good job. The quasi-private agency, which is not legally bound to report their financial records and whose employees are not subject to state ethics laws, has also come under fire for a suspected bid-rigging scheme, its failure to recognize education and worker training as essential building blocks in economic development, and for its failure to create and attract family-sustaining jobs in Wisconsin. The internal memo cites WEDCs single-minded focus to drive job creation through new initiatives as the reason for any missteps that have been made. However, under Scott Walker, Wisconsin has been among the worst states for job creation and has the under-performed the rest of the Midwest, leading one in five Wisconsin business owners to say they foresee layoffs in the coming year. Scott Walkers WEDC was supposed to help create 250,000 new jobs and be the symbol of his first term in office, Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Mike Tate said Monday. Well, it HAS become emblematic of Scott Walker deception and mismanagement. WEDC has lost $56 million in taxpayer funds and is dogged with rumors of bid-rigging, has a board full of Walkers campaign donors, and is led by a career Walker campaign operative with zero business experience. Scott Walker has even removed the 250,000 jobs promise from his website. It sounds like WEDC is going to symbolize perfectly Walker's time in office. Read more here."

It's been three years, and few Americans would say the economy is healthy. In fact, the national unemployment rate has been above 8% for a record 36 months - even though Obama promised it would be different. He promised his $825 billion stimulus would keep unemployment below 8%. But instead of creating jobs, it just created debt. Obama, however, once vowed to slow the growth of debt. He promised to cut the deficit in half by the end of his term. Instead, he produced record annual deficits for the past three years. Each exceeded $1 trillion. In total, he has added over $4.5 trillion to the national debt - debt that takes a toll on the economy and threatens our children's future. This is a sharp contrast with congressional Republicans, who, under the leadership of Wisconsin's own Rep. Paul Ryan, last year passed a budget and a plan for long-term fiscal solvency. On health care, the president promised that Obamacare would bring down premiums ""by $2,500 for the typical family."" But just last year, health care premiums for families rose by 9%. That's a pretty dramatic failure for a bill called ""the Affordable Care Act."" Instead of lower costs, Americans got bigger government. In 2008, Obama said now was the time to end our addiction to foreign oil. But just last year, he called his own energy policy ""just a hodgepodge."" Last month, he blocked the Keystone energy pipeline, a project that would have provided affordable, reliable, secure energy to Americans, while creating thousands of jobs. The president prioritized the special interests over Americans' interests. It's not the first time. Obama vowed that lobbyists would not ""find a job in my White House,"" but he has since hired nearly 100 current or former lobbyists. He criticizes Wall Street executives as ""fat cats,"" but his campaign actively solicits donations from them. Hypocrisy has become an Obama specialty, and Americans deserve better. They deserve a leader who keeps his word and governs like he campaigns. Wisconsinites have a leader like that in Gov. Scott Walker. Walker had to make tough choices and difficult decisions, but he kept his promises to Wisconsin voters. One year after taking office, he has balanced the budget, reformed government and saved teachers from layoffs. Unemployment in Wisconsin is lower, and property taxes are lower. The contrast with Obama is stark. America is decidedly worse off - our government is bigger, our debt is larger, our economy is weak and Americans are dispirited. The promise of ""hope and change"" has been broken. Reince Priebus is chairman of the Republican National Committee."
http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/22/frank-lasee/gop-us-senate-candidate-frank-lasee-says-study-pre/,"By The Journal Sentinel's Guy Boulton wrote this Jan. 1 in describing Obamacare's health insurance exchanges: ""The exchanges could help consumers and small businesses compare competing health plans"" and ""they also could increase price competition by requiring health insurers to offer more standardized plans and by providing consumers with better information about what they are buying."" Private-sector free-market insurance exchanges already exist without government intervention or taxpayer subsidies. If you Google ""health insurance quote,"" you will find a number of options. There are dozens of companies and hundreds of plan choices with a wide range of monthly costs depending on plan design. I used one of these to purchase insurance for my family, and millions of other people have used them as well. They work without government involvement. The real reason government-run exchanges are being created is to expand Medicaid and government-subsidized insurance. How will income or family size be verified on a website? This concept is ripe for fraud and abuse. And the subsidies are so generous that families of four making as much as $89,000 will be eligible for taxpayer subsidies. Our nation cannot afford this expensive program. Our country is overspending at a rapid and unsustainable rate of $1.3 trillion more than tax revenue annually. The federal debt is $15 trillion (and growing) and now is more than the annual Gross Domestic Product. When we are broke and overspending, it doesn't make sense to subsidize 75% of the people of Mississippi or more than half of those with private insurance in Wisconsin. Those pressing for a state or federal health insurance exchange in Wisconsin have misled people by telling them it will produce cost savings for both consumers and taxpayers. A government exchange will increase costs substantially both for consumers and taxpayers. Those saying otherwise may have their own interests at heart but certainly not those of Wisconsin and its citizens. A million-dollar study commissioned by the administration of former Gov. Jim Doyle told us that after Obamacare, nearly 90% of people with insurance will have their costs go up by more than 30%. Because of Obamacare, about 100,000 Wisconsinites will lose the private insurance they have now and will be forced to purchase new insurance. Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court may overturn Obamacare, and the elections in November may result in repeal or reform of the law. Government exchanges don't have to be active until January 2014. There is plenty of time for the state to act after the Supreme Court and the voters have weighed in. Many other states are waiting for the outcome of the Supreme Court and elections. True free-market exchanges do exist, and the competition they generate yields positive results. A government-run Obamacare exchange is deceptive, ill-conceived and an expensive government expansion that our nation cannot afford at this time or in the near future. Remember, the vast majority of citizens have the best health care in the world. Truly poor people already have Medicaid (free taxpayer-paid health care), and older folks have Medicare. The provisions of Obamacare will only increase both insurance and taxpayer costs. Wisconsin should not participate in this costly federal program until the last possible moment. State Sen. Frank Lasee (R-De Pere) represents the 1st Senate District."
http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/29/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-study-shows-federal-health-care-/,"Scott Walker, a Republican, is the governor of Wisconsin. Since the Supreme Court upheld President Obamas health-care mandate, there has been exhaustive discussion about the philosophical basis of this federal law. As Election Day approaches, debate will surely grow about the proper role of our federal government. But while much attention has focused on Congresss intention to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act, too few are studying the laws practical impact. The best place to see the effects of the law is in our nations laboratories, the states. Although the Supreme Court has ruled on the constitutionality of the act, Wisconsin shows that it is bad policy. The budget I signed into law last year increased state taxpayer spending on Medicaid by $1.2 billion in our biennial budget, which works out to be one of the largest annual increases in the country. While many states slashed Medicaid funding to deal with budget deficits, we made the biggest investment in the program in Wisconsins history. By putting in place the long-term structural changes needed to make our budget sustainable, we ensured that those who truly need assistance would continue to have access to affordable and quality health care well into the future. The good news is that responsible budgeting has put our state in a fairly unique position: Nearly 91 percent of Wisconsin residents have health insurance. According to the latest nationally available data, only three states have higher rates of coverage. The bad news is that, from a practical standpoint, Obamacare will devastate Wisconsin. An actuarial study commissioned by my predecessor, a Democrat, and completed last year found that if Obamacare is implemented in Wisconsin:  100,000 people will be dropped by their employer-sponsored health insurance; 59 percent of people who buy their own health insurance will experience an average premium increase of 31 percent; 150,000 people will stop buying health insurance in the private sector and will instead become dependent on the government and taxpayers; Between 2014 and 2019, Obamacare could cost Wisconsin taxpayers $1.12 billion; after all federal aid and tax credits are applied, the states portion of the bill will be $433 million; and Approximately 122,000 parents, caretakers and pregnant women with an income of more than 133 percent of the federal poverty level will no longer be eligible for Medicaid. Its important to go beyond these facts and understand what they really mean for those of us who live in the Badger State. Young people will be hit hard with premium increases. Those between 19 and 29 years old who have individual insurance will experience an average premium increase of $1,631 per year. A family of four that does not qualify for a subsidy can expect a 28 percentincrease  from $8,528 to $10,912. For those who are covered by the small-employer group market, the average premium increase will be 15 percent. These are just the laws effects on individuals. There are also statewide implications. In Wisconsin, 46 percent of residents who would receive assistance through Obamacare would have already had insurance coverage. That would result in taxpayers spending millions of dollars without providing new coverage. The law has also raised serious philosophical questions: Should the federal government force people to buy a product? What is the proper relationship between federal and state governments? Even setting aside those legitimate issues, one practical concern remains. I look at the effects that full implementation would have on my state, and I cant help but conclude that Obamacare punishes Wisconsin for budgeting responsibly and providing access to affordable and quality health care. It punishes young people, those who have responsibly purchased individual insurance, employers and employees of small businesses. In Wisconsin, the data show that Obamacare will increase the cost of health care for most residents. That is not a prescription for positive change. Other states will face similar situations. We can do better. Overall our federal government should be working to replicate the successes of states like Wisconsin  particularly focusing on those with high rates of coverage. And from a practical standpoint, the federal government should give Medicaid block grants to states. This would allow states to maximize the efficient use of tax dollars and increase private-sector competition while still providing care for those in need. Increasing access to health care wont come through mandates, taxes or penalties. Truly improving access for families will require costs to go down. Unfortunately, Obamacare moves in the opposite direction by making insurance more expensive."

Especially racism. Consider Wisconsins Department of Public Instruction. It evidently considers instruction synonymous with propaganda, which in the patois of progressivism is called consciousness-raising. Wisconsins DPI, in collaboration with the Orwellian-named federal program VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America; the volunteers are paid), urged white students to wear white wristbands as a reminder about your privilege, and as a personal commitment to explain why you wear the wristband. A flyer that was on the DPI Web site and distributed at a DPI-VISTA training class urged whites to put a note on your mirror or computer screen as a reminder to think about privilege, to make a daily list of the ways privilege played out and to conduct an internal dialogue asking questions such as How do I make myself comfortable with privilege? and What am I doing today to undo my privilege? After criticism erupted, the DPI removed the flyer from its Web site and posted a dishonest statement claiming that the wristbands were a hoax perpetrated by conservatives. But, again, the flyer DPI posted explicitly advocated the wristbands. And Wisconsins taxpayer-funded indoctrination continues, funded by more than Wisconsin taxpayers. In Delavan-Darien High Schools American Diversity curriculum, students were urged to verify white privilege by visiting a Wal-Mart toy section and counting the white and black dolls. After objections, the school district is reconsidering this curriculum. Such distractions from the study of calculus and literature are encouraged by CREATE Wisconsin (the acronym stands for Culturally Responsive Education for All: Training and Enhancement), which is funded with federal tax dollars from IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The disability being rectified here is, presumably, the handicap of insufficient guilt  arising from false consciousness  about white privilege. Today, the school systems in 20 states employ more non-teachers than teachers. The Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice reports that between 1950 and 2009, while the number of K-12 students increased 96 percent, full-time-equivalent school employees increased 386 percent. The number of teachers increased 252 percent, but the number of bureaucrats  including consciousness-raising sensitivity enforcers and other non-teachers  increased 702 percent. The report says states could have saved more than $24 billion annually if non-teaching staff had grown only as fast as student enrollment. And Americans wonder why their generous K-12 financing (higher per pupil than all but three of the 34 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations) has done so little to improve reading, math and science scores. Higher education, from which much of such diversity and sensitivity nonsense trickles down, cries poverty while spending lavishly on administrative overhead irrelevant to its teaching and research missions. The Manhattan Institutes Heather Mac Donald notes that in 2011, while the University of California at San Diego was pruning academic offerings, it created a vice chancellor for equity, diversity and inclusion to augment a diversity apparatus that included an assistant vice chancellor for diversity; faculty advisers, staff, graduate and undergraduate diversity coordinators and liaisons; a director of development for diversity initiatives; the Committee on Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation Issues; the Diversity Council; the Campus Council on Climate, Culture and Inclusion; and much more. Perhaps tens of millions could be diverted from progressive gestures to academic purposes by abolishing on every American campus every administrative position whose title contains the words diversity, equity, race, ethnicity, sustainability, green, gender, inclusion, identity, interconnectivity, globalization, climate, campus climate, cross-cultural or multiculturalism. No corner of the country is immune to propaganda pretending to be pedagogy. Lincoln Brown of KVEL-AM in Vernal, Utah, says one student from the University of Utah showed him required reading that told students to list ways your family may have colluded with or benefited from the exploitation of African-Americans. Another reading was titled White Privilege  Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack. Twenty-five years ago, President Reagan, paraphrasing Education Secretary William Bennett, said: If you serve a child a rotten hamburger in America, federal, state and local agencies will investigate you, summon you, close you down, whatever. But if you provide a child with a rotten education, nothing happens, except that youre liable to be given more money to do it with. But only until the soaring tuitions and taxes that fund this featherbedding for administrators of political correctness create a critical mass of parental and taxpayer disgust.

This information was contained in the BLSs Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. That census includes detailed information from more than 96 percent of employers. This is much more accurate than monthly jobs reports, which are compiled by surveying a fraction of employers. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel used the same data to determine Wisconsin ranked 44th in private sector job growth from September 2011 to September 2012. John Koskinen, Chief Economist at the Wisconsin Department of Revenue, confirmed the private sector job growth numbers uncovered by the MacIver News Service, Thats literally true, however, Koskinen said economists typically use the same month from different years to avoid seasonal variations in employment. Although Koskinen might be uncomfortable comparing jobs numbers from January 2011 and September 2012, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin felt those two months strengthen the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story. The day Scott Walker took office, we were 11th in job creation. Now, we are 44th, and it is a direct result of both his inattention and his policies. Those have included massive cuts to job-creating investments in education, health care, technology, infrastructure and vocational training, reads a DPW release from March 28, 2013. DPW neglected to mention the fact that during that same timeframe, Wisconsin added over 137,000 private sector jobs putting Walker well on track to meet his goal by the end of his term. And although the chief economist for DOR is wary of using such a timeframe, Koskinen completely rejects the statement that Wisconsin is 44th in job creation. During a presentation in March, Koskinen pointed out Wisconsins unemployment rate is consistently lower than the national average. Also, previously the BLS reported Wisconsin was losing jobs, only to have to revise those numbers later and admit the state gained jobs. Additionally the MacIver News Service reported the state collected 5 percent more tax revenue in February 2013 than in February 2012 according to the Department of Revenue, suggesting Wisconsinites are making and spending more money.

http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/jul/26/dave-hansen/wisconsin-sen-dave-hansen-says-state-budget-forces/,"As predicted: Republican donors salivating at opportunity to buy state properties

(Madison)—State Senator Dave Hansen (D-Green Bay) said a provision in the recently passed state budget that allows the Governor to sell state properties to his friends and donors without going through the established bidding process should be repealed.

“Nearly anyone who took an objective look at this scheme said it would open the door to cronyism and mixing the selling of state assets with campaign contributions. This provision removes these sales from the competitive bidding process which is designed to protect the interests of Wisconsin taxpayers,” said Hansen. “It flies in the face of our tradition of open and transparent government and it should be repealed as soon as possible.”

Senator Hansen’s comments came in response to recent news reports that showed Terrence Wall, a Madison developer who donated over $85,000 to Governor Walker and mostly Republican candidates, sent a letter and his private cell phone number to Walker outlining a number of state buildings he wanted to buy. Included among the properties are the State Crime Lab, the main office building for the Department of Transportation and the Department of Administration building which was constructed in the 1990’s during Tommy Thompson’s administration.

“The ink on the budget wasn’t even dry before one of these wealthy Republican donors was angling for a sweetheart deal from a political party that appears all too eager to reward their friends—either by giving them yet another tax break, making taxpayers fund a separate, unaccountable voucher school system or by forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance that could cost them as much as $4000 per year.”

“Senate Republicans should have stopped this special interest give away but they chose instead to follow the money and go along with it.”

Sale of government property in other states has also been controversial. In Arizona, Governor Jan Brewer and the Republican-held legislature sold the state’s capitol building for $81 million and then rented the building from its private owner. In 2012 Brewer reversed course and asked the legislature for $105 million to buy it back—a move that would cost Arizona taxpayers well over $24 million.

“People really need to pay attention to this issue or they may find that, like Arizona, they may find themselves paying rent the state capitol building to Terrence Wall.”"
http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/23/lena-taylor/taylor-says-alleged-advantage-bail-bonds-not-backe/,"Early on Wednesday, June 5th, when the sun was coming up, the Joint Finance Committee was putting the finishing touches on the state budget bill for presentation to the full Legislature.

It was early morning sausage making. Now there are many times that both parties have made some major changes in the dark of night, but this one may take a bigger piece of the cake than ever before. The budget bill, as it will be presented to the Assembly and then the Senate, has some major provisions that you need to be aware of.

Bail Bonds are back. Since the early 1970’s private bail bondsmen and bounty hunters have been illegal in Wisconsin. In the 2011 budget, Republicans tried to introduce them back to Wisconsin, but Governor Walker wisely vetoed them out of budget.

This time, the majority party is back at it again. In the last minute addition to the budget, bail bondsmen were authorized to work in five counties in Wisconsin – Milwaukee, Waukesha, Racine, Kenosha, and Dane.

There is no statistical evidence that bail bonds increase the likelihood of those awaiting trial returning to court for their scheduled hearings, etc. In fact, this provision is widely opposed by almost everyone in the criminal justice system in Wisconsin, especially in Milwaukee.


The last thing we need is unaccountable, armed bounty hunters (think Dog the Bounty Hunter from TV) breaking down doors in community.


What we have now is working; in fact, it works quite well when you look at the number of African- American men Wisconsin is putting in prison.

Obviously, I am being sarcastic, but the truth is we don’t need any more trigger-happy agents running around Milwaukee profiting on the criminal justice system.


Major education changes were adopted in the last minute as well. The new budget only provides $75 dollars more to each school district’s revenue limit.

This is a tiny addition of funding and woefully inadequate for public schools in Milwaukee and elsewhere in Wisconsin.

Additionally, the Governor included expansion of the choice school program, similar to what we have here in Milwaukee, to certain communities in Wisconsin. Joint Finance changed this to allow that expansion to every community in the state but capped the program at 500 students in the 2013- Lena C. Taylor 14 school and 1,000 students in every year thereafter. For Milwaukee, the budget now increases funding to the choice and charter schools operating in the city and also allows UW-Milwaukee to charter a school anywhere in Milwaukee County or an adjacent county.


As you know very onerous and unnecessary provisions in the budget, like the Rent-To-Own provisions were already removed from the bill.

But late last night the Finance Committee decided to add one very peculiar provision. The budget now bans the Center for Investigative Journalism from leasing space at UW-Madison or allowing any employee of the UW to work at the Center.

The Center operates WisconsinWatch.org which reports on major issues in Wisconsin, like frac sand mining, money in politics, and other policy initiatives. We should be very afraid when government begins to directly interfere in the reporting work of journalists.


Wisconsin is not a nation, we don’t have military secrets, and our citizens should have access to information to make informed decisions.


All in all, the budget is an example of sausage-making. We don’t like how it looks making this law, the ingredients are not great, and, unlike a good sausage from Milwaukee, this law tastes terrible.

As we approach the $17 trillion debt level, I want to emphasize how dangerous this is for our nation. An old proverb tells us that the borrower is slave to the lender, and as we continue to spend and build debt, think about who we are getting our money from. The answer is the printing press and China.

The printing press puts us as a slave to inflation because the value of every dollar slowly goes down as more dollars enter the market. China will continue to hold more and more influence on the US as their debt holding increases. We already see the effects of this in the unfair trade practices that exist between the two countries.

When the amount of interest you pay on your debt exceeds your total tax revenue (yes it does-check it out!), common sense tells us that all other programs are at risk. So why is Washington doing nothing about it? It is because we let them. Until we elect true leaders, no matter what party, this problem will continue to fester, and there is a bottom to every hole.

http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/20/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/wisconsin-manufacturers-commerce-says-typical-mini/,"SHARE By Mary Burke's support of the proposal to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour might make for good politicking in her campaign for governor, but her plan would be economically devastating to thousands of Wisconsin workers. Raising the minimum wage is a lose-lose proposition because it will result in significant Wisconsin job losses, will reduce economic opportunity for younger and lower-skilled workers, will raise consumer prices and will not meaningfully reduce poverty or help the working poor. A recent analysis by the Employment Policies Institute (EPI) found that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would kill as many as 27,937 jobs in Wisconsin. That estimate is consistent with a projection by the Congressional Budget Office that predicted 500,000 lost jobs nationwide if the federal minimum wage was increased to $10.10. So how would raising the minimum wage result in lost jobs? The answer is quite simple. Increasing the minimum wage will increase labor costs for employers. In turn, employers will respond by reducing their workforce, hiring fewer workers and reducing hours of work for existing employees. That translates into job loss and fewer economic opportunities for workers. WMC recently commissioned a statewide poll to test this issue and found 53% of likely voters initially support increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. However, voters quickly abandon the proposal when told of the projected job losses. Support plummets to 39% when voters know raising the minimum wage kills jobs. In order to understand who will be harmed most by a minimum wage increase, it is important to understand who minimum wage earners are. The data show those who stand to lose the most from a minimum wage increase are younger and lower-skilled workers. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 1.1% of workers over age 25 earn the minimum wage. That's because typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families. They are not living in poverty nor are they earning a wage that is responsible for sustaining a family. Wisconsin is no exception. According to the EPI analysis, the average household income of Wisconsin families impacted by raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour is $58,812. That's actually higher than Wisconsin's median household income of $52,627. Clearly, the majority of minimum wage earners are not the working poor, but are instead young people entering the workforce with little experience and very few skills. They are people who desperately need entry-level jobs to begin the process of climbing the economic ladder by acquiring skills that lead to better jobs with higher wages. Unfortunately, increasing the minimum wage places the bottom rung of the economic ladder out of reach for many of these workers by eliminating entry-level positions that help workers gain the experience needed to advance in the workforce. Those who advocate a minimum wage increase as a means to reduce poverty are on the wrong side of history. Increasing the minimum wage has proven to be an ineffective policy in terms of reducing poverty. The U.S. Census Bureau recently released a report that found 59.7% of working-age people in poverty do not work. It is difficult to imagine how increasing the minimum wage will help lift people out of poverty when roughly 60% of those in poverty aren't even working in the first place. The empirical evidence also suggests raising the minimum wage simply does not impact poverty levels. Between 2003 and 2007, a total of 28 states increased their minimum wage beyond the level of the federal minimum wage. A study done in 2010 by Joseph Sabia and Richard Burkhauser focused on the minimum wage and poverty found no evidence the minimum wage lowered poverty rates in any of those 28 states. Increasing the minimum wage is a poorly conceived economic policy that would cost Wisconsin thousands of jobs. It misplaces focus on the small sliver of the workforce (2.5%) who earn the minimum wage while simultaneously making it harder for entry-level workers to get ahead. Politicians should instead focus on how we can improve our state's business climate to attract and retain high-wage jobs such as those in our manufacturing sector.

But in the good ol’ U.S. of A. you can sue people for anything, so this week the Obama administration is assisting a group of Hispanics and Asians to stop a Green Bay, Wisconsin metal and plastics manufacturer for firing a group of employees that refused to speak English.

The U.S. says that this violates section VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the feds came out to say “even though those skills were not needed to perform the jobs, the offense still exists under the law.”

Requirements for speaking fluent English in the workplace are put there to circumvent discrimination laws put in place to protect workers from other countries. The government attorney handling the case says “But superficial appearances are not fooling anyone.”

The attorney in case went on to say, “When speaking English fluently is not, in fact, required for the safe and effective performance of a job, nor for the successful operation of the employer’s business, requiring employees to be fluent in English usually constitutes employment discrimination on the basis of national origin — and thus violates federal law.”

Now, the state’s unemployment rate sits at 5.8% – lower than the national average and the lowest in 5 years. In contrast, when Mary Burke was Commerce Secretary, the state’s unemployment rate was at or above the national average for 20 months – the only time in the last 25 years that it has done so. We can’t afford to return to those policies.

Forward vs. Backward:

Through Scott Walker’s leadership, Wisconsin’s unemployment now stands at 5.8%, the lowest in five years and the 9th consecutive month it has dropped
During Mary Burke’s time as Commerce Secretary, the unemployment rate in the state topped the national average for the only time in the last 25 years, having been at or above the national rate for 20 months
When Scott Walker took office, the unemployment rate was 7.8% and over 133,000 jobs had been lost in the Doyle-Burke Administration. Now, the unemployment rate is two points lower, and we have over 100,000 new jobs under Walker – and counting
Under Walker, employer confidence now stands at 95%; At the end of the Doyle-Burke Administration employer confidence was only 10%
Business rankings under Scott Walker: Since taking office, Wisconsin is up 27 spots to now rank 14th; Under Mary Burke: Wisconsin went down 8 spots to 33rd
Our economic rankings have improved and unemployment has dropped each year, which is a stark contrast to Mary Burke’s policies of higher taxes and large deficits that caused Wisconsin’s rankings to plummet and unemployment to rise above the national average
During the Doyle-Burke Administration unemployment peaked at 9.2%; under Governor Walker our unemployment rate is at its lowest in 5 years and is now 5.8%
We can’t afford to go back to policies that bring higher taxes, higher unemployment and job loss. Let’s continue moving forward under Governor Walker’s record of lower unemployment and job creation."
http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/16/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-group-says-rep-sean-duffy-voted-against/,"As House Republicans shamelessly try to score political points over the crisis in veterans care, Congresswoman  Ileana Ros-Lehtinen’s votes tell the true story of her record: when she had a chance to fix this problem, she voted against the fixes.
 
“It’s a shame that when Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen had a chance to do something to help shorten the wait time at the VA she voted no,” said Josh Schwerin of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  “Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen voted against a commonsense solution to this problem and our heroes deserve better.”
 
BACKGROUND:
 
Voted to Block the Veterans Backlog Reduction Act. In 2013, Ros-Lehtinen voted against considering the Veterans Backlog Reduction Act, which would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to pay provisional benefits for certain non-adjudicated claims.  The previous question was approved 224-195. A vote against the motion would have allowed for consideration of the veterans bill. [H Res 232, Vote #180, 5/23/13; Congressional Record, H2925, 5/23/13]
 
Voted Against Increasing Funds to Reduce the Backlog in Veterans Disability Claims.  In 2013, Ros-Lehtinen voted against a motion that would help reduce the backlog of disability claims for veterans. The motion would have added $9.2 million in funding to hire an additional 94 claims processors to help reduce the veterans disability claims backlog. [CQ Floor Votes, 6/04/13; HR 2216, Vote #192, 6/04/13]
 
Voted For Extreme Plan That Would “Likely Result” In a Government Shutdown. In 2013, Ros-Lehtinen voted for an extreme House Republican continuing resolution that the Associated Press reported would “likely result” in the shutdown of the federal government. The bill passed 230-189. [HJ Res 59, Vote #478, 9/20/13; Associated Press,8/23/13]
 
Shutdown Delayed Training for Service Members Transitioning to Civilian Life.  In November 2013, the OMB reported that the shutdown “delayed workshops for 1,400 military service members to help them transition to civilian life and employment.” [OMB, November 2013]
 
Shutdown Delayed Military Death Benefits.  “But until the lapse in federal funding ends, the families of deceased military personnel cannot expect to receive the “death gratuity” of $100,000 the Defense Department deposits in their bank account within 24 to 36 hours, defense officials said […]Grieving families also cannot expect the military to cover the usual costs of travel to meet their loved ones returning home in American flag-draped coffins through Dover Air Force Base, or pay for funerals and burials, according to the Defense Department.” [Washington Post, 10/09/13]
 
Shutdown Forced VA to Close Regional Offices, Suspend Services and Programs. “All public access to the VA’s 56 regional offices was suspended Tuesday because of a lack of funds, the VA said […]The VA is also suspending services such as educational and vocational counseling and outreach programs, including those conducted at military facilities.” [Washington Post, 10/09/13]
 
Voted Against Protecting Veterans Benefits During a Government Shutdown. In September 2013, Ros-Lehtinen voted against ensuring veterans benefits would not be delayed during a government shutdown. She later voted against guaranteeing the processing of veterans benefits during a government shutdown. [HJ Res 59, Vote #477, 9/20/13; HR 3102, Vote #475, 9/19/13; CQ Floor Votes, 9/20/13, 9/19/13]
 
Voted to Make it More Difficult for Veterans to Get Benefits.  In 2011, Ros-Lehtinen voted for an amendment that would make it harder for low-income veterans and Social Security recipients to retain counsel in a civil action against the United States, like when fighting for benefits. The Lummis amendment imposed a seven-month moratorium on all legal fees paid under the Equal Access to Justice Act, a Reagan-era law designed to help people afford an attorney while suing the government.  “We’re in the middle of two wars right now and to make it harder for a veteran — fighting for his benefits — to have an attorney is a horrible thing. That’s not what this country is about,” Robert Chishold, a prominent veterans’ law attorney said. [Politico, 2/23/11; HR 1, Vote #85, 2/17/11]
 
Voted Against Protecting Mortgage Relief for Veterans and Active Duty Service Members. In 2011, Ros-Lehtinen voted against a motion that would protect mortgage assistance under the Emergency Mortgage Relief Program for active duty service members and their families, veterans, and Gold Star eligible families. The underling bill would terminate the Home Affordable Modification Program. [CQ Floor Votes, 3/11/11; HR 839, Vote #197, 3/29/11]
 
Voted Against Increasing Housing Assistance for Veterans. In June 2012, Ros-Lehtinen voted against increasing funding for veterans rental voucher’s by $75 million.  [CQ Floor Votes, 6/29/12; HR 5972, Vote #449, 6/29/12]
 
Voted to Slash Homeless Veterans’ Assistance. In 2011, Ros-Lehtinen voted for a spending bill that would have eliminated $75 million slated to house homeless Veterans. According to CNN, the cuts would have hurt some 11,000 homeless veterans who qualified for housing in 2011 but had not received vouchers. [HR 1, Vote # 147, 2/19/11; National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, 4/12/11; CNN, 3/1/11]
 
Voted Against Increasing Funds for Veterans Medical and Prosthetic Research.  In March 2012, Ros-Lehtinen voted against a motion that would increase funding for veterans medical and prosthetic research by $28.3 million. [CQ Floor Votes, 5/31/12; HR 5854, Vote #304, 5/31/12]
 
Voted Against Increasing Funds for Veterans Medical Services for Mental Health.  In June 2011, Ros-Lehtinen voted against a motion that would increase funding for veterans medical services for post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide prevention by $20 million. [CQ Floor Votes, 6/14/11; Watertown Daily Times, 6/14/11; HR 2055, Vote #417, 6/14/11]

http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/29/paul-ryan/us-purchase-heavy-water-iran-direct-subsidy-irans-/,"WASHINGTON — House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) issued the following statement on the Obama administration’s reported $8.6 million purchase of heavy water from Iran:

“For Tehran, the nuclear agreement is the gift that keeps on giving. This purchase—part of what appears to be the administration’s full-court press to sweeten the deal—will directly subsidize Iran’s nuclear program. It’s yet another unprecedented concession to the world’s leading state-sponsor of terrorism.”  

NOTE: Earlier this week, Speaker Ryan urged the administration to rule out additional economic concessions to Iran, including granting Tehran access to the U.S dollar and financial system."
http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/05/katrina-shankland/heavy-presidential-campaign-ious-scott-walker-fois/,"MADISON – This afternoon, it was reported that Governor Walker’s political campaign will no longer be paying for his security team’s travel costs for campaign events. Wisconsin taxpayers will be left footing the bill, even when those costs are incurred by Governor Walker leaving the state for campaign rallies.
 
In response, Rep. Katrina Shankland (D-Stevens Point) released the following statement:
 
“Faced with $1 million in campaign debt, Governor Walker is trying to cut corners in any way he can. In this case, he is unloading his campaign security costs onto the backs of Wisconsin taxpayers.
 
""Since the governor is publicly announcing that he will bill his campaign security travel costs to taxpayers, it is even more pressing that the legislature take action. I urge my Republican colleagues to call a hearing on the Wisconsin Taxpayer Protection Act to end this abuse of public dollars.”

Test scores dropped Wisconsin from 2nd in the country to 41st in the nation among states where more than half the students took the exam. ""The latest information released today is another glaring failure of the Walker Administration to make sound, smart policy decisions to improve education in our state,"" Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Martha Laning said on Thursday. ""As a parent with children who have recently graduated from high school I've had a front row seat to the destructive changes that have short-changed our children and their futures. When budget cuts force schools to do more with less it's no surprise that the quality of the education our children receive inevitably declines."" In last year's State of the State address, Governor Scott Walker claimed his education policies were working, boasting that ""ACT scores are up and Wisconsin now ranks second in the country."" Now, five days away from Walker's next State of the State it's clear that the policies of the last six years have failed schools, students, and parents. Out of a top score of 36, the average test score in the state dropped from 22.0 to 20.0, which pulls Wisconsin to dead last in the Midwest and tied with Kentucky for 41st in the entire country. Due to funding cuts, damage has been made to Wisconsin's traditionally high-quality education system and now our kids, businesses and communities will suffer. Nationally, Wisconsin saw the fourth largest cut to K-12 general school aid funding in 2015-16 according to the nonpartisan research policy institute, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. While Wisconsin has traditionally ranked above average in terms of ACT scores, these latest numbers place Wisconsin dead last in the Midwest and among the bottom ten states nationally. ""I can only empathize with the parents across the state who see this news and grow ever more concerned with the direction of our state. Our kids deserve the same high-quality education we had as kids and the choices the legislature has made is stealing that from them.."" said Laning. ""The state of education in Wisconsin is not strong. The newest numbers should be a wake-up call to the governor and the Republican legislature that their misguided priorities are hurting our education system and, therefore, our kids, businesses and communities."""

What am I hearing? Folks are sick of politics as usual - my neighbors point out time and time again that the Republican majority in our Wisconsin State Capitol is failing ordinary Wisconsinites, and that the President and his billionaire cabinet are frightening and clearly out of touch with what hard working people across America need. I am hearing that the people of Wisconsin want policy makers to stand up and fight for a bold and unapologetic progressive vision that allows all Wisconsinites the chance to thrive. Thats why I am more committed now than ever before to work hard to strengthen our communities, to put government back to work for the people, and to help build an economy that works for all of us. I know that we each do better when we all do better and I look forward to when our paths cross so you too can share your thoughts and ideas of a stronger Wisconsin with me.

Rotunda Report My Legislative Agenda Marijuana Legalization: I am proud to be the lead author of a bill to legalize marijuana for both recreational and medicinal use in Wisconsin. So many of you have reached out to my office to express your support for my legislation, and many of you have also taken the opportunity to reach out to other legislators to encourage them to support my bill as well. Thank you for all you are doing. Many of you have had questions about how you can be involved and what the next steps are for this legislation. The bill is currently being circulated for co-sponsorship, which means Im asking my colleagues to sign on their names in support of my legislation. During this time, it is really important that you reach out to your State Representatives and Senators in the Wisconsin State Legislature and encourage them to consider putting their names on the bill in support. Once the co-sponsorship period closes, the bill will then be officially introduced and will be assigned to a committee. You can keep up with updates on this legislation by signing up for notifications about bills relating to marijuana here. Once the bill has been assigned to a committee in both the Senate and the Assembly, we can then begin asking the chair of the committee to give my bill a public hearing. I welcome your continued engagement and support and would encourage those of you who live outside of my district please make sure you are contacting your representatives to let them know you want to #legalizeopportunity. Bills Circulated for Co-Sponsorship LRB-2729/1: Representative Gary Hebl and Senator Dave Hansen have introduced a constitutional amendment to put power directly in the hands of the people of Wisconsin. This constitutional amendment will create a manner by which the citizens of Wisconsin can approve or deny a bill passed by the legislature via a binding veto referendum. It also creates an avenue by which Wisconsinites can put laws and a constitutional amendment on the ballot directly. I am proud to support this proposal. LRB-0028: Senator Terry Moulton and Representative Rob Stafsholt introduced a package of bills that would eliminate age requirements for participating in the hunting mentorship program and hunting devices authorized to be used under the hunting mentorship program. Though my husband and sons hunt, and I value the hunting traditions of Wisconsin, I am very concerned about this dangerous legislation and will work hard to oppose it. Foxconn We certainly know that in recent years the system has been rigged in favor of the rich and powerful. We have also been reminded that we each need to stand up and fight for what is fair and just. In light of events that occurred last week, now more than ever we must stand by these principles. Just last week, Governor Walker and his Republican pals in the state legislature stood side by side with President Trump to announce a proposal to bring Foxconn to Wisconsin. Not only will this deal effectively gut the few remaining environmental protections in Wisconsin, but it only guarantees 3,000 jobs while costing ordinary Wisconsin taxpayers more than $3 billion in tax dollar giveaways. Break it down: thats more than $1 million in taxpayer dollars PER JOB. Unsurprisingly, the Foxconn calculations just dont seem to add up. As a small business owner, I am deeply concerned that we continue to dismally trail the nation in small business growth and start-ups, but even more troubling is that our Governor is turning his back on those small businesses while choosing to give every advantage to a foreign company that seems to break more promises than jobs created. I am already hearing from my neighbors that Governor Walker has failed Wisconsin over the last six years and that they are concerned that this is just another political distraction and stunt to hide those failures. Keep sharing your thoughts! Email me at: _EMAIL_ I will keep working on this issue and will endeavor to push for fairness, transparency, accountability at every opportunity. Budget Update As of today, Governor Walker and his Republican colleagues in the legislature are a month overdue in finding a solution to our state's budget crisis. The impact of their inaction is beginning to hurt the hardworking people of Wisconsin. Just this last week - hiring was stalled in a school district waiting to find out what their budget for new staff is. As Wisconsin Republicans continue to shirk their responsibilities these situations will only continue and worsen. Its time for a budget that fully funds taxpayer priorities and puts the needs of people in our communities first. I am disappointed that the disarray the WI GOP finds itself in is hurting working families, our public schools, and our roads. From what we do know about this budget, special interests wants are placed above ordinary Wisconsinites needs. Bottom line - Governor Walker and his Republican legislative colleagues are continuing to fail to address the problems that they have spent seven years creating. You and I both know that #WIDeserveBetter! Advocacy Group Meetings A 2016 Marquette Law School Poll showed that 59 percent of the respondents said that they want marijuana to be fully legalized and regulated like alcohol. I know that it is my job to listen and consider the thoughts and opinions of my constituents, and frankly that is why I have introduced LRB-2457 to fully legalize marijuana in Wisconsin. Since the bill introduction I have had quite a few one-on-one meetings with folks about the bill. I truly appreciate each and every one of you that has taken the time to share your thoughts with me. Because of what you have shared with me, I know that this is an issue that crosses party lines, and if passed, we have a unique chance to increases opportunity, safety, and accountability for all Wisconsinites. Community and In-District Events Tour at Bodgery Makerspace A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit the Bodgery Makerspace--a locally owned venture thats right here in the 48th Assembly District.

http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/23/scott-walker/testing-scott-walkers-top-10-business-ranking-clai/,"Transformational. The addition of 13,000 high-tech jobs and an investment of $10 billion will indeed be a transformational, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Wisconsin.

Foxconn, the global electronics manufacturing giant, will make an initial investment of $10 billion to build a 20 million square-foot high-tech manufacturing campus in Wisconsin. To put the massive size of this operation into perspective, you could fit 11 Lambeau Fields inside Foxconn's planned campus. Now that's big.

It will be the largest economic development project in state history and one of the biggest in the history of our country. In fact, it represents the largest greenfield investment made by a foreign-based company in U.S. history.

While Foxconn is best known for assembling the iPhone, employees at this new Wisconsin plant will manufacture liquid crystal display (LCD) panels and other components for a variety of industries. This will be the first time they are Made in America, and we are proud that they decided to make them in Wisconsin.

The new ecosystem will directly create 13,000 new jobs with an average annual salary topping $53,000 plus benefits. On top of the direct jobs that Foxconn will create, there will be an estimated 10,000 construction jobs created to build the campus. Construction companies from all over our state will be needed for this massive project. Plus, there will be an estimated 22,000 more indirect and induced jobs created because of Foxconn's economic impact. These jobs will be created across Wisconsin.

Foxconn will have a transformational effect for generations to come in much the same way Silicon Valley transformed the San Francisco Bay Area and the Research Triangle transformed North Carolina. We're calling it ""Wisconn Valley.""

Wisconn Valley will be about more than the Foxconn ecosystem. It will represent Wisconsin's willingness and readiness to evolve into a leader in high-tech advanced manufacturing and technology research and development. It will have an impact far beyond the site, as the company will require an estimated 150 suppliers to support its operations, potentially generating more than $1 billion annually in business for companies throughout the state.

Wisconn Valley will help us attract talent from across the country and around the world. It will motivate more students to pursue careers in advanced manufacturing. And it will help keep more of our talented graduates here in Wisconsin. Instead of a brain drain, we will have a brain gain.

Foxconn is coming to our state is because we are ready. Once a bottom 10 state for business, Wisconsin is now in the top 10 states for business. Our 3.1% unemployment rate is better than the national average and the lowest since October 1999. We also have one of the best percentages of people working in the nation. We've not only balanced our budgets; we've created budget surpluses. We've cut taxes so hardworking families and small business owners can keep more of their own money, we've made significant investments in worker training, education and infrastructure, and our government reforms have saved taxpayers billions of dollars. Wisconsin is ready for this moment.


Pay to grow is the focus of our incentive package. Foxconn invests $10 billion and creates 13,000 jobs paying an average $53,875 per year plus benefits. In turn, the state provides up to $3 billion worth of incentives. We believe that Foxconn will exceed its goals, but if it does not, it won't get the full incentive package. There are plenty of safeguards for the taxpayers. State lawmakers now need to affirm the package.

The $3 billion is paid out over 15 years. During that time, Foxconn will invest $10 billion to create its new high-tech manufacturing campus, and the combined payroll for the 13,000 employees will exceed $10.5 billion. Bottom line: $3 billion worth of incentives brings $10 billion in investment and more than $10.5 billion in new payroll to the state.

By comparison, the State of Washington offered an incentive package to Boeing in 2013 worth $8.7 billion just to retain the company's operations. Similarly, the State of Michigan offered General Motors a $2.3 billion package in 2009 to save 1,200 jobs. Wisconsin is offering $3 billion for a $10 billion investment and 13,000 direct jobs.

Foxconn's announcement is outstanding news for the people of Wisconsin. The fact that this global corporation chose Wisconsin over every other state in America and every other place in the world should make us feel proud. Our future has never been brighter. Wisconsin is ready. We are ready for Wisconn Valley.

Scott Walker is the governor of Wisconsin."

U.S. Congressman Sean Duffy (R-WI) today re-introduced the Womens Public Health & Safety Act. The legislation would empower states to exclude abortion providers from receiving Medicaid funds. Congressman Duffy released the following statement upon the introduction of the Womens Public Health & Safety Act: New evidence reveals that abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions. If a state wants to take taxpayer money that would have otherwise gone to a disreputable organization like Planned Parenthood and instead transfer it to non-controversial community centers that provide womens health, they should be free to do so. Background: The bill makes abortion providers not fall under the free choice of qualified provider provision. So excluding abortion providers from Medicaid funding would not count as limiting healthcare options, which is not allowed under Medicaid. In 2015, the Womens Public Health & Safety Act passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 236 to 193.

http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/09/gwen-moore/sexual-assault-domestic-violence-themselves-are-no/,"Washington, D.C. — Following the passage of the American Health Care Act in the House, Congresswoman Gwen Moore (WI-04) released the following statement:
 
“Today, I emphatically voted against Trumpcare because it is quite simply a matter of life or death for my constituents. The passage of this legislative abomination underscores the depths of Republicans’ indifference to the 24 million Americans who will lose their coverage and the 14 million Americans who will be kicked off of Medicaid. Not only will this deeply flawed and misguided tax giveaway disguised as a health care bill have a crushing impact on people with pre-existing conditions who will face both higher premiums and deductibles, but it also threatens those with employer-based plans, as well as children and adults with disabilities. Put simply, no one is safe from the fallout of this catastrophe in the making. 
 
“I am particularly appalled that President Trump and my Republican colleagues have proven all too willing to turn their backs on our country’s women by endangering their maternity and prenatal care and allowing insurers to deny preventive health care services like mammograms and gynecological exams. Under Trumpcare, conditions like postpartum depression and being a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault could be considered pre-existing conditions, and women in uniform will be at risk as millions of veterans and their families will face a multitude of barriers in seeking care. 
 
“Now, I look to my colleagues in the Senate to be guided by the pleas of their constituents who have voiced their strident opposition to this disastrous bill. I sincerely hope they listen to the cancer survivors and the children living with chronic illnesses who now fear for their lives due to this unconscionable Republican effort. For their sake, I hope those in the upper chamber will use the commonsense and empathy that is severely lacking across the aisle in the House. The lives of all our constituents are on the line.”

Bryon Houlgrave/The Register President Trump takes a photo with a man as he hands out food at the NRG Center in Houston where he met with evacuees from Hurricane Harvey. (Photo: Courtney Sacco, Caller-Times via the USA TODAY Network) As we celebrate Labor Day, we are reminded of the inherent dignity of work and the American worker. In America, we honor grit. We honor determination. We honor craftsmanship. And we honor the men and women who turn dreams into reality with their own two hands. Earlier this year, I traveled to Wisconsin to sign the Buy American and Hire American executive order. With that action, we sent a powerful signal to the world that we are going to defend our workers, protect our jobs and put America first. Today, the hopes and dreams of American workers and their families remain a top priority for my administration. That is why we are launching efforts to reduce the crushing tax burden that is harming our companies and our workers. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions of jobs, trillions of dollars and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. To fix this, we have made the foundation of our job creation agenda fundamentally reforming our tax code for the first time in more than 30 years. I want to work with Congress on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker and pro-American. Our plan will dramatically reduce income taxes for American workers and families. It will nearly double the standard deduction to help families get ahead. It will make our complex tax code more simple and fair. It will put money back into the pockets of the people who earned it. And it will bring back American jobs by making our businesses competitive once again. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan led the effort to make America the most competitive nation in the world by cutting our business tax rate to 34%, well below the average rate of other developed nations at the time. It worked. Our economy boomed, the middle class thrived and median family income increased. But our economic competitors did not sit still. They saw what we did and started lowering their business tax rates, too. Over the past 30 years, the average business tax rate among developed nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) fell from 45% to less than 24%. Instead of remaining competitive over the same period, we actually raised our rate to 35%. When combined with state and local taxes, American businesses today are effectively taxed at 39%. We have gone from a business tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors to one that is more than 60% higher. The United States is now behind nations such as France, Germany, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico and South Korea. We are dead last. In response to this lack of competitiveness, large corporations have changed their business models to export jobs to other countries and then ship their goods back to the United States. Other businesses  even classic American brands  have been acquired by foreign competitors or have moved their headquarters overseas. This has been a disaster for American workers. We know that when a business shuts down, or a factory packs up and leaves the United States for another country, the cost is measured not merely in lost jobs. It is measured in diminished confidence and lost hope. We owe it to the American people to fix this broken system. American businesses want to prosper on our shores, and middle-class families are ready for more growth, more jobs and higher pay. Thats why my administration is embracing a new economic model: the American model. Under this system, we will encourage companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers and to help rebuild our American cities and communities. Americans will succeed and grow together  as one team, with one shared sense of purpose, and one glorious American destiny. It is now time for all members of Congress  Democrat, Republican and Independent  to support pro-American tax reform. Its time for Congress to provide a level playing field for our workers, to bring American companies back home, to attract new companies and businesses to our country, and to put more money into the pockets of everyday hardworking people. If we do this  if we unite in the name of common sense  then we will add millions of jobs, funnel hundreds of billions of dollars into our economy and give America the competitive advantage we so desperately need. Instead of exporting our jobs, we will export our goods, and lift millions of struggling citizens from welfare to work. We will unleash Americas full potential. And in doing so, we will truly make America great again. Donald Trump is president of the United States. Read or Share this story: _LINKS_"

For the last 25 years, whenever an election approaches, Sen. Baldwin seems to begrudgingly leave her elitist donors on the coasts for Wisconsin. Almost overnight, after months and months away from her constituents, she tries to trick us into believing shes spent the past two decades in Washington representing us, as opposed to representing donors in California and New York who try to impose their agenda on the Badger State. Senator Baldwin has made this deceitful campaign of tricking the people of our great state her focus. Wisconsin deserves better, and voters wont fall for it again. This time around, the recently passed Republican tax bill provides voters with the perfect opportunity to hold Senator Baldwin and her Democrat colleagues accountable for their unwillingness to do what is right for the millions of Wisconsinites and Americans they claim to represent. Senator Baldwin and her colleagues in Washington were given a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform an outdated, broken and costly tax code that discouraged job growth and investment in America, failed to reward the middle-class or boost economic growth, and lined the pockets of Washington D.C. special interests, all at the expense of hard-working citizens and small businesses. She claims to support a Buy America philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words. Instead of doing the right thing and voting for legislation that would have improved the lives of so many whose voices she is supposed to represent in Washington, Senator Baldwin did what she has done so often during her almost 30 years in public office: She played politics with the well-being and wallets of Wisconsin citizens. It was a desperate attempt to score cheap political points  and not so cheap campaign contributions  from her radical, far left supporters in faraway states. Here in Wisconsin, it is estimated that a family of four will receive more than $2,500 per year in tax relief from the bill Senator Baldwin voted against. That extra $200 plus per month might not mean much to the liberal millionaires from New York and California whom she relies on to bankroll her campaigns, but it could change the lives of folks from Beloit to Superior, and everywhere in between. Given the senators long history of only supporting policies championed by the far left and the coastal elite, it is no surprise she voted against a tax bill that will help so many Wisconsinites. In fact, she proudly joined large numbers from California, New York and New Jerseys Congressional delegations in voting against more money in the pockets of Wisconsin families. I have no doubt that Ms. Baldwin will soon be back to embark on one of her semiannual election-year tours, masquerading as Wisconsins senator. As she travels our great state, she ought to take the time and ask voters what they think about the extra income theyre receiving as a result of the tax bill. Senator Baldwin wont like the answer, but least shell know a little bit more about the people of Wisconsin.

Mahlon was born in Milwaukee and grew up in Delavan, Wisconsin. He now lives with his wife, April and two children, Sieanna and Karson in Fitchburg. Mahlon followed in his older brothers footsteps when he became a fire fighter in Madison twenty years ago. His two brothers are fire fighters in Atlanta and St. Paul. These careers came out of a family that instilled values of service and working for others. This sense of service is also exemplified in Mahlons other activities. He was a counselor at the Wisconsin Alliance for Fire Safetys Burn Camp, which he also directed for five years. This summer camp worked with burn-injured youth to help them cope with their unique situation and build a network of support. Mahlon also worked as a street outreach coordinator with Briarpatch and Youth Services of Southern Wisconsin, where he linked at-risk youth with services from their community. When the fight over collective bargaining and Scott Walker's Act 10 law began in 2011, Mahlon led the fire fighters in a monumental stand of solidarity with other public servants. Despite being exempted from the bill, Mahlon and his fellow fire fighters marched on the Capitol with fellow working families that were threatened by the Budget Repair Bill. Mahlon took the opportunity to travel the state as a fire fighter spreading the word about Scott Walkers divisive policies. Mahlon ran for Lieutenant Governor as the Democratic nominee in the 2012 recall election. Recently, Mahlon was instrumental to passing two pieces of legislation that were a huge victory for fire fighters across the state. The Infectious Disease Presumption fought to make sure fire fighters are covered if they contract a disease or disability on the job. Additionally, the legislature passed a bill that ensures families and spouses of fire fighters who die in the line of duty will have their health insurance premiums covered."

He claimed that the U.S. is turning into Sodom now that it has enshrined sodomy into the United States Constitution and cities like Houston are trying to force women to go into mens bathrooms and men to go into womens bathrooms. Now its a constitutional right for sodomites to marry each other, he lamented, warning that the wrath of God is revealed against this stuff. He explained: I dont want the wrath of God to hit this country, its a great country, Id like to see America continue strong, but this is one way of weakening it. First of all, were going to have this financial collapse. Were setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country thats probably the way hed do it. At that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: I believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people. I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. Im thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach, Robertson opined. The viewer then interrupted The 700 Club host to state that that sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II, referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame. I dont believe that, Robertson quickly became defensive. I am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps. Do you understand my point of view here? the host asked the caller. I do, the caller replied. But I also understand that youre trying to do to gay people what the Nazis did to my people more than half a century ago. And I am appalled by it."

https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/dec/17/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-says-clean-power-plan-will-raise-texas/,"This week, world governments continue meeting in Paris to negotiate climate change regulations. The president has pledged to cut U.S. carbon emissions by 28 percent by 2025. But to meet this arbitrary goal, he intends to bypass Congress and the American people and impose costly, job-killing regulations.

These regulations will only burden Americans with more bureaucracy and higher costs — all for little environmental benefit. In other words, it’s all pain and no gain.

The EPA’s Power Plan is the cornerstone of the president’s Paris climate pledge. Yet the EPA’s own data show that this regulation would reduce sea level rise by only 1/100th of an inch, the thickness of three sheets of paper. This would be laughable if it weren’t for the tremendous costs it imposes on the American people.

Texans will be hit even harder than those in other states. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has estimated that the Obama administration’s Power Plan will cause energy costs in Texas to rise as much as 16 percent per year. This means the price of everything from milk to bread to other consumer goods will increase as well.

A world-respected climate scientist testified before Congress last week that even if all the pledges by all the nations were implemented, it would only reduce global warming by less than one-third of one degree Fahrenheit.

As chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, my only goal is to protect the American people from unnecessary and burdensome regulations and to force the Obama administration to tell the truth. For example, I recently asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to provide the committee with information about its decision to change the way it analyzes temperature data. Its employees had altered historical climate data to get politically correct results in an attempt to disprove the 18 year lack of global temperature increases.

NOAA’s report ignored temperatures collected by satellites. This data, considered by many to be the most objective, has clearly showed no warming for the past two decades. NOAA and this administration simply chose to ignore the satellite data so they could get the results they wanted. Almost every other study has found no increase in global temperature in recent years.

When the Science committee raised concerns about NOAA’s report, the agency refused to explain its findings and provide documents to the committee. The American people have a right to see the data and know the motivations behind this study and others.

The Science committee’s actions pose a real threat to the Obama administration’s political agenda of scaring people into giving the government more control over their lives. Environmental extremists have constructed a house of cards that might collapse when subjected to scrutiny.

Climate scientists welcome outside critiques, which are an integral part of the scientific method. Real scientists never claim certainty and always avoid exaggeration. Alarmists, on the other hand, promote a political agenda and dismiss any opposition.

The climate is always changing and human activity likely plays some role. But what climate alarmists say is sometimes untrue and often exaggerated. We should rely on good science, not science fiction, when we evaluate climate change.

Biased news coverage of climate change is one reason why the American people feel that they cannot trust the national media. A recent Rasmussen poll found that 61 percent of likely U.S. voters do not trust the political news they receive from the national media.

This is why I feel that liberal media bias is a threat to the American people. If the American people can’t get the facts about the environment or other subjects, they can’t make good decisions. And if they can’t make good decisions, our own democracy is at risk.

Drinking three glasses of champagne a week could help to stave off dementia and Alzheimer's disease, health experts have claimed.

Researchers from Reading University said the grapes used to make fancy fizz contain compounds which boost memory and battle illness.

When tested on rats, the pinot noir and pinot meunier varities were shown to have significant health benefits.

Now academics want to gather together a group of lucky pensioners to see if champagne has the same effect on humans.

Professor Jeremy Spencer told the Mail on Sunday that the ""the results were dramatic"".

""This research is exciting because it illustrates for the first time that moderate consumption of champagne has the potential to influence cognitive functioning such as memory,"" he said.

However, a spokesman for the Alzheimer's Society said ""a lot more"" research had to be conducted before champagne was used as a medicine.

So can you afford this luxury medicine or is fizz a prescription that's just for the posh?

Well, there are about six large glasses of champagne in a bottle, which starts at about £20 for a relatively cheap brand.

Pricey prescription: Ace of Spades champagne costs £125,000(Image: Splash)

This means that a dose of cham-medicine would cost at least a tenner - a few pounds more than the £8.05 Brits pay for an NHS prescription.

If you decided to use a more expensive bottle as your medicine, you could end up paying more than £50,000 per dose.

It is unclear whether cheaper fizz such as prosecco or cava have the same health-giving effects, which is bad news for drinkers on a budget.

Kevin McCarthy to forsake his pursuit of the the top post in the United States House today launched a campaign opposing Rep. Paul Ryan.

""Paul Ryan is undeserving of the Speakership,"" says Fire Paul Ryan organizer and Chairman of Constitutional Rights PAC Larry Ward  ""We fought Rep. McCarthy's race to lead the House because of his compromises, and we aren't going to turn a blind eye toward's Ryan, despite the fact that he presents himself as a conservative.""

The coalition's website, FirePaulRyan.com, urges Americans to pledge to ""Fire Paul Ryan"" should he become the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and, like the Fire McCarthy project, focuses on Ryan's poor reception among conservatives.

“Just like John Boehner and his deputy Kevin McCarthy, Paul Ryan scores terribly with conservatives,” says FirePaulRyan.com, adding:
• Heritage Action scores Ryan at an awful 55
• Conservative Review assigned him an F-rating at 58
• The New American's Freedom Index also scores him at a low 58 

Coalition member and former U.S. Congressman Paul Broun (R-Ga.) believes that Paul Ryan will continue the failed policies of John Boehner to the detriment of the American people.  

""I like Paul Ryan personally, but I believe that if he were to be elected Speaker we will see a continuation of Boehner policies,"" Broun says. ""We must elect a Speaker that will stand-up to Obama and his radical policies that are hurting all Americans, especially the poor and senior citizens on limited incomes. We have to have leadership that is strong and truly conservative.""

Like Broun, former U.S. Senate candidate Col. Rob Maness (Ret) argues that this country ""needs a speaker of the house that will support a strategy based on conservative principles and winning ideas – not a speaker that will support party principles and losing ideas.”

After personally taking the pledge to Fire Paul Ryan, conservative candidate for Congress Kay Daly is now challenging her opponent, Rep. Renee Ellmers (RINO-NC2), to join the coalition and oppose Ryan as Speaker.

“Paul Ryan would be the most liberal, pro-union, Republican Speaker in history,"" says Daly. ""He is one of only six House Republicans who voted for Teddy Kennedy’s bill to force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees. Even John Boehner never did that!”

Alan Keyes of Americans United for Freedom says Rep. Boehner’s resignation ""creates major opportunity to select an individual committed to restoring the American Republic"" – he too is a signatory of the Fire Paul Ryan pledge. 

Ken Benway, LTC, USA (Ret.), Special Operations Speaks co-founder said ""The veteran community has not forgotten the Ryan-Murray budget which targeted massive cuts to military retirement. We can not back a speaker that turned his back on the veteran community."" 

The Fire Paul Ryan coalition exists to demand a conservative be selected to lead a ""bottom-up"" United States House of Representatives.

""We forced Boehner to step down, Cantor was defeated, and McCarthy withdrew – yet the Establishment continues to serve up RINO after RINO after RINO,"" says Ward. ""If Ryan is chosen, we’ll see that he’s fired.""

Constitutional Rights PAC's campaign to Fire Paul Ryan is supported by prominent conservatives including former U.S. Congressman Paul Broun, Alan Keyes, Larry Klayman, and Col. Rob Maness (Ret), Larry Ward and a growing number of organizations including American Dream Initiative, Conservative Action Fund, FreedomWatch, GatorPAC, Life & Liberty PAC, Madison Project, PatriotPAC, Political Media, Special Operations Speaks PAC, and 1776 Coalition.

“We do not need to be negotiating with Iran - period. Iran is a dangerous nation that cannot be trusted and this deal only weakens the national security of our country and that of our allies – particularly Israel. Like many times before, President Obama is manipulating the system to get his way: presenting this to the American people as a ‘deal’ instead of what it really is –a treaty – to circumvent needing approval by Congress. President Obama and Secretary Kerry also showed a lack of leadership and strength in agreeing to lift Iran’s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct. The administration put the ball in Iran’s hands, and it will forever be a huge mistake.
 
“I came to Congress to make our country and our world a safer and better place for my children and grandchildren, and this deal does not do either. Not only do I reject this agreement, but I reject the President’s secretive manipulation and the negotiations with Iran entirely.”
 
In addition to voting NO on H.R. 3461, the approval of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Rep. Westmoreland voted in support of H.R. 3460, which would prevent the President from ending the current sanctions against Iran.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump deserves credit for forcing all 17 Republican candidates to talk about the social costs of illegal immigration, but it is not “Trump’s issue.” We will be making a fatal mistake if we let the media discuss it that way.

As Ann Coulter has pointed out, this is the most critical issue of the 2016 race because this is the issue that will define whether or not there will even be an American nation recognizable as the “home of the free and land of the brave.”


But illegal immigration is not “Ann Coulter’s issue” any more than it is “Tom Tancredo’s issue.” It is America’s issue — not only because it will define America in the 21st Century but because it also defines American elections and who will be voting in elections in 2020 and beyond. It also illuminates the power of the mainstream media to keep issues off the national stage.

Think of illegal immigration this way: If the liberal media can keep illegal alien crime out of the “kitchen table debate,” they can keep any issue out of the debate. And they will if they can get away with it. For those reasons, illegal immigration is much more than an issue of public policy; it is the poster child for media malpractice.

The media’s attempt to suppress public awareness over illegal alien crime and the effects of illegal immigration on American workers’ jobs and wages is nothing less than censorship on a massive scale. We need to start talking about it in those terms and hold the media accountable for the lack of ethical standards.

The mainstream media – including, sadly, major segments of the presumably conservative media, like the Wall Street Journal — are working overtime to keep the American public and the American voters in the dark on the scope of illegal alien crime. The murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco exposed only the tip of a massive iceberg, and the media establishment is desperate to avoid dealing with the iceberg underneath.

Let’s look at a few numbers. You haven’t seen them in the New York Times, Atlanta Constitution, or the Miami Herald, nor have they been featured on NBC Nightly news or CNN. So, the average American is blissfully unaware of them.

Between 2008 and 2014, 40% of all murder convictions in Florida were criminal aliens. In New York it was 34% and Arizona 17.8%.
During those years, criminal aliens accounted for 38% of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York, while illegal aliens constitute only 5.6% of the total population in those states.
That 38% represents 7,085 murders out of the total of 18,643.
That 5.6% figure for the average illegal alien population in those five states comes from US Census estimates. We know the real number is double that official estimate. Yet, even if it is 11%, it is still shameful that the percentage of murders by criminal aliens is more than triple the illegal population in those states.

Those astounding numbers were compiled by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) using official Department of Justice data on criminal aliens in the nation’s correctional system. The numbers were the basis for a presentation at a recent New Hampshire conference sponsored by the highly respected Center for Security Policy. You can view the full presentation here:

The federal Bureau of Prisons category “criminal aliens” includes legal immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes, but over 90% of incarcerated criminal aliens are illegal aliens, so it is reasonable to use these numbers as a close approximation of the extent of illegal alien crime.

Similar data is available at the state level if state officials have the desire to look for it. The Texas Department of Public Safety reports that between 2008 and 2014, 35% of the all murder convictions were illegal aliens—averaging 472 murders each year from 2004 to 2008.

Do you know the numbers for your state? Does your congressman, Senator, or Governor know those numbers? Of course not. If you are afraid of the answer, don’t ask the question.

There is widespread public ignorance of illegal alien crime in every state because the mainstream media does investigate such matters. Why? Because they do not want the public to think about such things. The media, from the Associated Press down to the Main Street News, does not even allow the phrase “illegal immigrant” to appear in print.

So, the numbers are out there in the criminal justice system and correctional institutions, waiting to be compiled and published. State attorneys general and state legislators could access the data if they were interested, and so could the media, but they don’t. In fact, in Colorado in 2006, the state legislature passed a law ordering the state Attorney General to compile accurate data on the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens and send a bill for reimbursement to the federal government. The state AG sent the feds a bill for only half the real costs — the cost of inmates in the state prison system and not the costs imposed on taxpayers by an equal number of inmates in county jails across the state.

The US Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Programs publishes an annual report on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, a report that includes data on the number of criminal aliens incarcerated each state prison system and each county jail. It takes some prodigious digging to find the data, but it is there.

But our mainstream media, our self-described guardians of the First Amendment, consciously avoids the effort and declines to put a public spotlight on the problem or demand public scrutiny and public accountability. Why?

The answer is that public debate on the problem of illegal alien crime does not serve the progressive political agenda. The issue is swept under the rug and anyone who raises it is called a racist.

This is media malpractice of historic proportions, and publishers and editors are the unindicted coconspirators in those 7,085 murders."

“The death tax causes serious problems for family farmers and small business owners who want to have their children and grandchildren continue their life’s work. In many cases, this excessive and duplicative tax forces them to sell the farm or business just to pay these punitive taxes, keeping them from passing down the culmination of their lifetime of work to the next generation. Our vote to repeal the death tax today is a crucial step toward implementing a simpler, fairer tax code and ensuring that our small businesses can continue to create the jobs Virginia’s Fifth District needs.

“We must continue to free our Main Street businesses and family farms from government-created obstacles to economic growth, and I remain committed to advancing policies that will spur job creation and economic recovery. I was proud to cosponsor this commonsense legislation and see it pass the House with bipartisan support. I urge our colleagues in the Senate to continue working with us to promote success for our small businesses and family farms so that they can create jobs and generate opportunity and prosperity for our communities.”"
https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/apr/17/judicial-watch/judicial-watch-says-isis-has-camp-mexico-and-near-/,"ISIS is operating a camp just a few miles from El Paso, Texas, according to Judicial Watch sources that include a Mexican Army field grade officer and a Mexican Federal Police Inspector.

The exact location where the terrorist group has established its base is around eight miles from the U.S. border in an area known as “Anapra” situated just west of Ciudad Juárez in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Another ISIS cell to the west of Ciudad Juárez, in Puerto Palomas, targets the New Mexico towns of Columbus and Deming for easy access to the United States, the same knowledgeable sources confirm.

During the course of a joint operation last week, Mexican Army and federal law enforcement officials discovered documents in Arabic and Urdu, as well as “plans” of Fort Bliss – the sprawling military installation that houses the US Army’s 1st Armored Division. Muslim prayer rugs were recovered with the documents during the operation.

Law enforcement and intelligence sources report the area around Anapra is dominated by the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes Cartel (“Juárez Cartel”), La Línea (the enforcement arm of the cartel) and the Barrio Azteca (a gang originally formed in the jails of El Paso). Cartel control of the Anapra area make it an extremely dangerous and hostile operating environment for Mexican Army and Federal Police operations.

According to these same sources, “coyotes” engaged in human smuggling – and working for Juárez Cartel – help move ISIS terrorists through the desert and across the border between Santa Teresa and Sunland Park, New Mexico. To the east of El Paso and Ciudad Juárez, cartel-backed “coyotes” are also smuggling ISIS terrorists through the porous border between Acala and Fort Hancock, Texas. These specific areas were targeted for exploitation by ISIS because of their understaffed municipal and county police forces, and the relative safe-havens the areas provide for the unchecked large-scale drug smuggling that was already ongoing.

Mexican intelligence sources report that ISIS intends to exploit the railways and airport facilities in the vicinity of Santa Teresa, NM (a US port-of-entry). The sources also say that ISIS has “spotters” located in the East Potrillo Mountains of New Mexico (largely managed by the Bureau of Land Management) to assist with terrorist border crossing operations. ISIS is conducting reconnaissance of regional universities; the White Sands Missile Range; government facilities in Alamogordo, NM; Ft. Bliss; and the electrical power facilities near Anapra and Chaparral, NM."
https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/apr/13/dave-brat/brat-says-obamacare-repeal-would-save-nation-2-tri/,"Washington, DC (March 17, 2015) – Statement from Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), a member of the House Budget Committee, on the House budget released today:

“Today, Republicans are presenting a budget that will balance the federal budget in less than 10 years through reductions in duplicative and wasteful spending; a budget that will fully repeal Obamacare and allow for alternatives that actually lower costs; and a budget that will reform entitlement programs to support those in need, prevent fraud, and ensure these programs are financially sustainable so they are available for future generations.

“House Republicans have released a budget that will take aim at fixing some of the greatest threats currently facing our nation.

“The first priority of this budget proposal is to balance the federal budget in less than 10 years by making $5.5 trillion in spending reductions over the course of that time. Under current policy, the federal government will spend $48.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Under this proposal, it will spend roughly $43.2 trillion.  This budget responsibly reforms government spending while avoiding heavy-handed cuts – protecting key priorities while eliminating waste and modernizing programs. As former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen has said, our debt is ‘the single, biggest threat to our national security.’  This budget aims to tackle this threat head-on, because we cannot achieve national security without economic security. 

“This budget fulfills Republicans’ pledge to voters to repeal Obamacare in its entirety – including all of the tax increases, job-killing regulations, and mandates – saving our nation more than $2 trillion.  Instead of a complex structure of subsidies, mandates, and penalties, this budget increases access to affordable health care by expanding choices and flexibility for individuals, families, and businesses.  For instance, this budget will empower states -- not Washington -- to tailor their Medicaid programs so that they can best serve the most vulnerable of their citizens. The budget also proposes to reform Medicare to harness the power of consumer choice that has made the prescription drug plan under Medicare Part D so popular. 

“This budget will ensure better care for our veterans by working to enhance oversight over the Department of Veterans Affairs and its bureaucratic mismanagement. We will continue working to ensure that we provide sufficient resources to our veterans to more effectively provide benefits to those who have fought to defend our country and our way of life.

“This budget builds upon the work of the House Education and the Workforce Committee to consolidate federal job-training programs, which will produce better results for the millions of Americans looking to improve their skills in their search for jobs.

“This budget will provide some desperately needed reforms to entitlement programs.  Federal spending for food stamps, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), has increased from $21 billion in 2002 to $76 billion in 2014. Our budget calls for reduced funding for federal advertising efforts to increase SNAP enrollment. Those savings are then shifted into programs that help people get off permanent dependency, such as job-training programs.

“This budget recommends easing the burden of regulations on American workers and their employers. It calls on Congress to enact legislation to reform our regulatory system by eliminating unnecessary red tape and by ensuring that regulations do not disproportionately disadvantage low-income Americans.  Since President Obama took office in January 2009, the federal government has issued more than 468,500 pages of regulations. The overwhelming amount and burdensome nature of these regulations are hurting our economy. The National Association of Manufacturers estimates the total cost of regulations is as high as $2.03 trillion per year, and compliance costs fall ‘disproportionately on small businesses.’ This translates into fewer job opportunities for American workers and much higher costs for consumers.

“This budget also seeks to eliminate several corporate welfare programs, reaffirming our commitment to stopping cronyism. This budget makes clear that Washington should not be in the business of picking the winners and losers of our economy in the private sector.  The best way to ensure a vibrant and strong economy is to allow innovators to thrive based on merit and the actual consumer demand for their products and services -- not based on the powerful friends they have in Washington. 

“Today, six years into our very weak recovery, wages are stagnant, median income is down, debt has mounted on the backs of children not yet born, and economic growth is sputtering. Hard-working American families are struggling as average hourly wages are barely keeping pace with inflation, real median household income is just under $52,000 – one of the lowest levels since the mid-1990s – and an unhealthy percentage of the American workforce has dropped out of the labor market. 

“Between the thousands of pages of ineffective and overburdening regulations, the millions of unemployed American workers, and the trillions in out-of-control spending, it is clear that we have trillion dollar problems that call for trillion dollar solutions.  This budget – with its serious and common sense proposals – represents a solid first step toward reining in uncontrolled federal spending, turning our economy around, and creating an environment that spurs job creation and higher wages for all Americans.”

The proposed fiscal year 2016 House budget is here."
https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/apr/02/erick-erickson/redstate-editor-decries-apple-chief-not-doing-busi/,"To recap: Tim Cook (please, please click this link) and the left are happy to do business in countries that stone to death or otherwise jail gay people, but will not do business with Indiana, which merely passed a law insisting that the “free exercise” clause of the first amendment be on the same legal footing in courts as the “free speech” clause of the first amendment.

The Supreme Court, in Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Local Educators’ Ass’n, 460 U.S. 37 (1983), ruled that for a state to restrict content based speech, it must have a compelling governmental interest. But the Court subsequently ruled that the free exercise clause, also in the First Amendment, need not fall under the compelling governmental interest” standard. President Bill Clinton and a near unanimous Congress disagreed and passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

31 states similarly moved to protect religious practice and 20 have explicit copies of the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Indiana is the latest. Georgia’s Governor, Nathan Deal, just tucked tail and ran from putting religious expression on the same legal footing as speech. The cowards of the Georgia Republican Party decided they would rather serve Mamon and have the checks to prove it.

What we are learning in the controversy, though, is simple: you will be made to care. There will be no middle ground. Many people would like to find middle ground. Many churches would like to find middle ground. But there will be none because homosexuals and their culture war warriors on the left are unwilling to have a middle ground.

The gay rights movement has decided their rights are equivalent to the Civil Rights movement and, through their interpretation of the Civl Rights movement, there can be no accommodation with the “free exercise” clause of the First Amendment. The “free exercise” clause is not limited to worship. It is “free exercise of religion.” It applies, or should, to the business owner who views his job as missional. It applies, or it should, to the religious school whose faculty honor the tenets of its faith. But the left, in recent years, has taken to calling it a “right to worship” instead of a “right to religion.”

The gay rights movement cannot abide a middle ground and a free exercise of religion for a simple reason — homosexuality is not normal in nature, in historic relationships, or in the sacred texts of almost all religions. The gay rights movement must therefore censor and subjugate dissent. Any who point out the lack of historic or religious acceptance or the lack of its ready existence in nature or, for that matter, the lack of scientific evidence showing homosexuality is a birth trait as opposed to a choice or external factors, must be shut up.

Homosexuals and the gay rights movement crave not tolerance, but the veneer of normalcy. To tolerate them means to allow them to be. But that also equates to heterosexuals being in a better position — one that decides who to tolerate. They have moved to demanding “equality” for now.

You can generally look at a woman or a person of a different race and tell immediately that the person is a woman or of a different race or ethnicity. One does not need a rainbow sticker on the back of their car to let people know they’re black. Or Asian. Or a Woman. The struggle for equality and civil rights between genders and races is inherently and objectively different from the gay rights movement. It is also why the gay rights movement is so invested in arguing that gender, though not sexuality, is a choice.

The gay agenda depends on equating the various struggles. Through mythology [insert your favorite historic person and he'll probably be declared gay], pseudoscience [you're born gay, but you pick your gender], and organized harassment of critics, the gay rights movement silences dissent to establish legitimacy in their quest for normalcy. The Stonewall riots are their Selma. Pay no attention to the lack of dogs in the street, poll taxes at the voting booth, and “heterosexual only” water fountains.

In Macon, Georgia, a Catholic School was okay with a gay band teacher until he wanted to get married. The Catholic Church views marriage as a church sacrament. The school dismisses teachers who get divorced for violating the sacrament and dismissed the gay band teacher for marrying in violation of the sacrament. The Obama Administration has decided the Catholic Church cannot set the standards of conduct for its faculty.

Around the country, gay rights activists have attacked Christians for daring to put their faith ahead of the wants and desires of homosexual marriage advocates. The Christians must be silenced and punished. Their faith cannot be respected. Legislation designed to allow diversity of religion and the free exercise thereof must be stopped and must be decried as discrimination.

The move to put “free exercise” on the same footing with “free speech” must be opposed because most major faiths recognize homosexuality as outside normal behavior. The logical outcome of this will eventually be to reduce free speech. People and faiths are going to have to be shut up for homosexuals to have the veneer of normalcy.

But it won’t stop there. Over time, the gay rights movement will move to pushing churches to marry gays because normally people get married in churches. Over time, it will move to push religious schools to abandon standards on sexuality. Over time, it will mean religious institutions lose their tax exempt status. Over time, it will require Bible believing churches be labeled hate groups and orthodox Christianity be forced to the sidelines. Over time, it will mean that the state must intervene and protect children from parents who want to raise them as orthodox Bible believing Christians.

Essentially, replacing the prohibition on religious tests clause of the Constitution will become an enforcement of a secularism clause. People of faith need not apply for jobs, political appointments, or elected office. People of faith will be the new bigots because their God said “go and sin no more” and dared list homosexuality as one of those sins.

Ultimately, over time, two thousand years of Christianity will be forced to be treated as the deviant lifestyle. You will be forced to pick a side. If you remain true to your God, you will be outside the bounds of acceptable conduct. You will be made to care.

If you pick the wrong side, you will be punished. Gay rights activists cannot show you tolerance and cannot treat you equally, because that means you and your faith that suggests homosexuality is a sin would be allowed to remain in the public square. And in the quest for the veneer for normalcy, that cannot stand.

For any who suggest this is hyperbole, a college is having its accreditation threatened because of its religious views on sex and a seventy year old is losing her home and business because she did not want to provide flowers to existing, regular customers for a gay wedding.

The good news, however, is this — Christianity is growing worldwide, even in places like China and Saudi Arabia. People of faith continue to have more kids and, in fact, can actually naturally procreate. The gay rights agenda may demand the veneer of normalcy, but nature itself will deny the gay community natural reproduction. And the religion that withstood Nero and even now withstands ISIS can withstand a bunch of angry people in comfortable shoes who need stickers on their cars to tell us who they are.

The wicked plots against the righteous and gnashes his teeth at him, but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he sees that his day is coming.

Psalm 37:12-13"
https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/apr/02/sally-kohn/sally-kohn-white-men-69-percent-arrested-violent/,"(CNN)Police in Pennsylvania are investigating the Delta Kappa Rho fraternity at Penn State University regarding two private group Facebook pages where members of the fraternity allegedly posted pictures of naked or partially dressed women, some of whom appeared to be passed out or asleep, ""or in other sexual or embarrassing positions."" Many of these pictures, it appears — though hopefully it goes without saying — were posted without these women's consent, or even awareness the photos were being taken. The Facebook pages also included pictures of frat members engaged in drug deals and hazing rituals.

This comes on the heels of members of a University of Oklahoma fraternity being caught on video singing an explicitly racist chant. In 2013, the Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter at the University of Texas at Arlington was shut down after three separate incidents of rape were reported to have taken place in the frat house. In 2010, members of a fraternity at Yale marched past a female dormitory chanting, ""No means yes, yes means anal!""

Most, though certainly not all, of these fraternity members are young white men. To be clear, the identity of the students involved in the Delta Kappa Rho Facebook posts has not been made public, but 73% of students at Penn State University are white and since Delta Kappa Rho is not a historically black fraternity, it's safe to assume that the Penn State frat is at least as white as the student body, which is to say predominantly so.

These incidents and more remind us of the rampant but often-ignored danger posed by young white men in America today. Although the news media and popular culture constantly cast suspicion on young Muslim and African-American men and the supposedly disproportionate and ever-present threats these communities pose, the fact is young white men are just as dangerous. But because our biases have us so busy looking the other way, we're ignoring the magnitude of this reality.

Certainly not all those perpetrating or advocating sexual and racial assault, within fraternities and outside of them, are young white men. Several of the instances of rape and sexual assault made public recently have certainly also included black and Latino young men. But while studies show that men who join fraternities are 300% more likely to rape, it's simply too easy to blame fraternities alone.

Maybe fraternities are boiling points of rape culture, but that culture is simmering everywhere else. And it makes sense we should examine every factor. This must include race and gender -- including whiteness and maleness. (Of course, the vast majority of young white men are law-abiding and present no risk; but that is also true of the vast majority of young black men and of Islamic men.)

Studies show that most school shooters, for instance, are white men — 97% are male, 79% are white. According to analysis, when there's a mass shooting, there's a 98% likelihood the shooter is male. And although black men are more than six times more likely to be sent to prison then white men, white men account for 69% of those arrested for violent crimes. And according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, since 9/11 more Americans have been killed on U.S. soil by white right-wing radicals than by Islamic jihadists.

At a moment in our society when we magnify the threats posed by Islamic radical terrorists and attempt to rationalize the killing by police of unarmed black men across the country by over-hyping fears about black male violence, the simple fact remains that white men are an ever-present if not greater threat to our safety. Our racial and Islamophobic biases blind us to the dangers posed by young white men, allowing them to continue unexamined and unaddressed.

A white friend in law school once pointed out in a discussion that one of the less-talked-about ramifications of racial profiling was that guilty young white kids were getting a pass. She said that if her white son were doing drugs in a park somewhere, she'd want the cops to find out and do something about it. But her white son would likely be overlooked, in a system irrationally and irresponsibly focused on the over-dramatized fear of black criminality. I'm not endorsing increasing rates of incarceration; we already have too many imprisoned for a free society in which rates of crime are dropping overall. I'm saying we should culturally, politically and, where appropriate, legally, scrutinize the criminal behavior of white men in equal proportion to the serial bad behavior in which they're engaged.

Is it time to think about banning fraternities as apparently rampant cesspools of misogynistic and racist culture? Maybe. But it's definitely time to acknowledge and address the violent and criminal actions of young white men as part of a broader, troubling trend that has for too long been overlooked.

The title of the study is SNAQCS (think “snacks”) — Study on Nutrition and Wellness Quality in Childcare Settings. The notice states:

Good nutrition is a key to proper childhood development, but not enough is known about the food children are eating in childcare and related programs.

The intent of the study is to document the quality of meals and snacks offered in childcare facilities… the types of activities that might promote or inhibit healthy weight and development… The study will take place in the context of heightened concern about adequate nutrition, diet quality and obesity in young children.

In addition, staff at childcare facilities are instructed to measure the height and weight of each child. It is also requesting a “Child Food Diary” from the parents: one for a typical “childcare day” as well as from a “non-childcare day.” Parents are also required to complete a parent interview.

The new data collected will be in addition to previous data collected in 2010 after the initial passage of HHFKA. An estimated 12,472 parents, young children, and childcare staff and sponsors will participate in the survey."

I have not had time to binge-watch the latest season of House of Cards, and drink in more of fictitious politician Underwood and his evil schemes. Most likely I will not have time until the August recess. That is not because I have been too busy plotting and posturing, a la Underwood. It is because I have been answering the mail.

In the last two months, nearly 700 constituents have written to me about the delisting of the grey wolf from the Endangered Species List. That is only a couple hundred more than have written to make sure I know of the potential harm from drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

I delight in hearing from so many of you about these critical environmental issues.

I spoke a great deal last year while campaigning for this job about the need to stop the harmful consequences of global climate change. I view this as the existential crisis of our generation, and of course the preeminent environmental issue. Many of the pressing energy and environmental issues we face are spokes on the climate change wheel, such as changing habitats, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and a drive toward alternative energy. We must find wise, long-term policies that will reverse our damaging impact on the world’s ecosystems.

Elsewhere the need for stronger environmental policies is obvious. Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have been in this century. Global temperature changes are causing prolonged droughts, extreme weather events and rising sea levels. More than 7,000 Americans lost their lives to climate change-fueled events last year. Millions more are at risk unless we act to reverse the disastrous effects.

Our legacy will be judged by the quality of the world we leave to our children and grandchildren. We can no longer keep our heads in the sand about the harmful impact our culture of waste is having on the world around us. I promise to use my positions on the House Committees on Natural Resources and Science, Space, and Technology to advocate for policies that leave this place better than it was when we inherited it.

Scott Walker might not live here anymore as he campaigns for president around the country, merely ""visiting"" Wisconsin from time to time, but millions of Wisconsinites value our conservation heritage and the preservation of our state park system -- so Walker's Iowa Caucus Budget proposal that guts funding for state parks is already cause for alarm. In addition to the fee increases proposed in Walker's budget, DNR Secretary Cathy Stepp yesterday told members of the Joint Finance Committee that the state was looking at several other options to generate revenue, like selling naming rights to our natural resources to offset Walker's cuts. 

Exclusive access for corporate donors to Wisconsin's farm and forest land and valuable state real estate has been a hallmark of Scott Walker's time in office. Scott Walker proposed in his 2013 budget changes to state law to allow foreign companies and individuals to buy large tracts of land, like farms, that are over 640 acres in size. Republicans and Democrats alike voiced concerns, and the proposal was deleted by the Joint Finance Committee. The Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation also opposed the changes. On his way out of office to a cushy lobbying job in Washington, D.C., Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen greenlit the Walker land proposal.

Another provision of the 2013 budget allowed the Walker administration to sell off state assets without a competitive bidding process. Included for sale are telecommunications towers and related infrastructure around the state, administrative buildings in Madison and Milwaukee, the Northern Wisconsin Center in Chippewa Falls, and land surrounding the state Department of Transportation building that has been described as prime commercial real estate.

Also in 2013 a group calling itself United Sportsmen of Wisconsin, a Tea Party group funded by the Koch brothers and headed by a Walker political insider, was almost the recipient of a $500,000 grant inserted by then-Rep. Scott Suder into the state budget for the purpose of promoting hunting, fishing and trapping in Wisconsin. United Sportsmen was found to have no history of outdoors training; their record more closely mirrored a lobbying organization for Republican interests and several prominent board members were found to have donated to Republican candidates and causes. It was only after United Sportsmen falsified its application to the state and at a hearing before the Joint Finance Committee in stating that they had a federal 501(c)(3) nonprofit designation did the Walker administration finally cancel the grant.

And following a $700,000 donation to Wisconsin Club for Growth for Scott Walker in exchange for access to the legislative process, the out-of-state mining company Gogebic Taconite was able to draft their own legislation, with assistance from the Governor's Office, on a controversial mining proposal that endangered Wisconsin's natural resources. Just last week, however, the company announced it was no longer going to continue with the project and they would not create the jobs promised.

""As someone who simply 'visits' Wisconsin as he campaigns for president, Scott Walker might not remember that our state parks are vital to Wisconsin's conservation heritage,"" Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Mike Tate said Wednesday. ""Are we going to see Donald Trump Trail or Koch Springs? McRib Mountain? This is absurd. The people who do live here in Wisconsin, and love our state, deserve better than Walker's short-sighted giveaways to corporate special interests that threaten our state's richest assets, our natural resources."""
https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/mar/03/naturalnewscom/vaccine-claim-misinterprets-data/,"(NaturalNews) Parents concerned about their vaccinated children potentially contracting measles from unvaccinated children may want to consider the fact that the bigger health threat is technically the vaccine, not the disease itself. Comparative data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reveal that nobody has died from measles in more than 10 years, while at least 108 deaths reported in VAERS during the same time frame have been linked to measles vaccines.

Many of our older readers probably remember a time when measles wasn't viewed with the obscene level of paranoid hysterics being witnessed today. Like chickenpox, measles was a common childhood infection that, after running its typically mild course, imparted lifelong immunity in those who contracted it. The risk of serious complications or death from measles has always been overwhelmingly minimal, in other words, with previous generations viewing it as something of a rite of passage.

Fast forward to today and all rationality and common sense has gone out the window on this issue. The media is reporting a few isolated cases of measles as if it were the black plague, calling for those who don't vaccinate their children to be ostracized from their communities or even jailed for ""putting others at unnecessary risk."" But where are the facts in all this unsubstantiated mania, which unfairly tags the unvaccinated as dangerous lepers?

Once again, the media is discarding factual reporting in favor of mindless sensationalism, attributing an alleged measles resurgence -- even this claim is specious -- to the unvaccinated. Whether or not this claim is actually true pales in importance compared to the fact that measles really isn't much of a threat in the first place. The measles vaccine, on the other hand, is a whole different story.

""There have been no measles deaths reported in the U.S. since 2003,"" the Associate Press reported based off statements made by Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

Meanwhile, VAERS, which captures only a very small percentage of the actual number of injuries and deaths associated with measles vaccines, reports at least 108 deaths associated with measles vaccines since 2003. Of these, a shocking 96 deaths were reported in conjunction with MMR, which is now the preferred vaccine for measles immunization.

Measles deaths were virtually nonexistent prior to introduction of vaccine, which is now triggering outbreaks
Some will try to argue that measles deaths are essentially nonexistent now because of measles vaccines, the first of which was introduced in 1963. But this argument holds no water -- U.S. measles mortality data shows that deaths from measles rapidly declined in the years leading up to when the first vaccine was introduced, validating the success of improved sanitation and better nutrition in making measles a non-problem.

This plotted graph from HealthSentinel.com visually illustrates this:

""What you may not have heard, is that by 1963, the death rate from measles in the United States had already dropped by approximately 98%,"" explains the International Medical Council on Vaccination (IMCV).

Not long after it was introduced, the first measles vaccine was actually found to manifest worse symptoms of measles in vaccinated patients than if they hadn't gotten the vaccine at all. The vaccine also suppressed the normal rash and fever associated with measles, obstructing the normal immune response and ultimately leading to future health problems for vaccinated individuals once they reached adulthood.

""[W]hereas natural measles exposure generally left the person with reliable lifelong immunity, measles vaccines leave the individual with waning immunity,"" adds IMCV. ""This dynamic of waning immunity means we will probably see measles epidemics even in highly vaccinated populations.""

https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/mar/02/thomas-tobin/ri-bishop-thomas-tobin-says-abortions-make-94-plan/,"Pope Francis has frequently used the phrase “throwaway culture” to lament the very casual way in which we dispose of unwanted members of the human family when they’re deemed burdensome, inconvenient or useless. While the Holy Father has applied this theme to a number of situations, it seems especially fitting to consider its relevance to abortion, particularly as our nation observes the 42nd Anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the horrible Supreme Court decision that rendered abortion legal in our nation.

For example, the Pope has described abortion as a product of a “widespread mentality of profit, the throwaway culture, which has today enslaved the hearts and minds of so many. . . Every unborn child, though unjustly condemned to be aborted, has the face of the Lord . . . they must not be thrown away.”
This throwaway culture emerged in full view here in Rhode Island recently, when workers discovered a “fetus,” that is, an unborn baby, estimated to be about 20 weeks old, at a sewage treatment plant in East Providence. Anyone with any degree of compassion at all finds this gruesome discovery to be extremely distressing and recoils at the thought of a tiny baby being treated so shamefully.


A couple of thoughts come quickly to mind. First, if the baby was indeed 20 weeks old as the police reported, it was just a few weeks away from being very viable outside of the womb. He (it was a little boy) should have and could have been saved. And one has to worry about the mother of the baby and what prompted her to treat her child this way. We need to pray for her physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. There are lots of good folks in our community and Church who even now would quickly offer her support and assistance if she were to come forward.

As we think about the mom, though, and lament the final disposition of her baby, we should understand that similar situations occur every time an abortion takes place in our nation, and even here in our local community. According to published statistics, approximately 4,000 abortions take place per year in Rhode Island. That means there are about 4,000 babies being “disposed of.” (By the way, how are the unborn, aborted babies handled at local abortion clinics? I suppose they’re just labeled “medical waste,” victims of the throwaway culture the Pope laments.)

Additionally, 4,000 abortions mean that about 4,000 women will live with the physical and psychological harm of this unnatural, invasive procedure, along with the spiritual harm of having destroyed their own child, one of God’s precious creations.

Leading the charge in this war on children, of course, is Planned Parenthood.

It’s well-documented that Planned Parenthood is America’s largest abortion provider. At least one out of every four abortions in the U.S. is performed in a Planned Parenthood facility. Since 1970 Planned Parenthood has performed a staggering 5.3 million abortions. According to the Susan B. Anthony List, abortions account for 94% of the services provided for pregnant women by Planned Parenthood.

And to make matters even more troubling, the immoral activities of Planned Parenthood are supported by the federal government, by your tax dollars and mine. During the most recent fiscal year, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America received more than $500 million from American taxpayers, accounting for 40% of the group’s total revenue. We need to say to our congressional delegation – for all that is good and holy, the public funding of Planned Parenthood must stop!

Let’s be very clear. Planned Parenthood is a destructive, immoral organization. The primary reason for its existence is the termination of pregnancy, i.e., the death of unborn children. How any Catholic worthy of the name can be supportive of, or associated in any way with, Planned Parenthood and its evil agenda is completely beyond me.

Our response to the throwaway culture, however, shouldn’t be a partisan matter of being Catholic or non-Catholic, conservative or liberal, Republican or Democrat. It’s a question of human rights, fundamental human dignity. It should concern us all! As Pope Francis has written so eloquently: “Among the vulnerable for whom the Church wishes to care with particular love and concern are unborn children, the most defenseless and innocent among us . . . The defense of unborn life is closely linked to the defense of each and every other human right . . . It is not ‘progressive’ to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life.” (Evangelii Gaudium, #213-214)

“It’s not progressive to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life.” That’s a statement we need to think about, for the Pope’s declaration applies to many issues and problems in our culture today.

Recently I awoke to a headline in the Providence Journal that said, “Slaughter of the Innocents.” Finally, I thought, the Journal is writing against abortion. Instead, the editorial was about the recent terrorist attack on a school in Pakistan that resulted in the death of 141 people, including 132 students, indeed an unspeakable, horrible event. The editorial, passionate and well-written, includes a comment by Pakistan Defense Minister Khawaja Asif, who mourned the death of the children by saying, “The smaller the coffin, the heavier it is to carry.”

Beautifully said. But, I wonder, how small are the coffins of the aborted children here in Rhode Island, or rather the coffins they would have if they were given a proper and dignified burial? Not to worry, though. Here in Rhode Island we just throw them away."
https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/jan/23/john-cornyn/cornyn-says-keystone-pipeline-through-texas-create/,"Last Tuesday marked the start of the 114th Congress, with fresh leadership and a new commitment to the American people.  We’re working to restore the Senate to its original purpose: a forum where we can discuss, debate, and pass legislation to benefit citizens.  That’s why we’re beginning with bipartisan legislation, like the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline.  But the President has already threatened to veto this economy-boosting bill and prevent it from becoming law.

It’s unfortunate that the President would shut down this bipartisan legislation.  In Texas, we’ve seen the direct positive impact of the pipeline on the local and state economy.  The Texas leg of the project, which delivers more than 400,000 barrels of crude oil from Cushing, OK to Southeast Texas each day, has already created 4,800 jobs in just the year it's been up and running. 

I promise to keep fighting for pro-growth legislation like this to get America back on track.  In fact, I’ve already introduced a bill to provide a permanent deduction for state and local sales taxes on your federal tax returns, which will allow you keep more of your hard-earned money in your pocket.  I also re-introduced legislation to crack down on human traffickers and lend their victims a helping hand to end these terrible crimes.

As the year goes on, I’ll continue to look for areas where we can promote economic growth and strong Texas values across America. "
https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/jan/18/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-low-gas-prices-are-result-obama-polici/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Robert C. “Bobby” Scott (VA-03) issued the following statement on his vote against H.R. 3, the latest attempt by House Republicans to force an approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline:

“Supporters of the Keystone XL Pipeline believe that construction of the pipeline will create jobs and move our nation closer to energy independence by reducing our reliance on foreign oil. However, these beliefs fail to recognize the current economic climate.  Last year, the United States produced more oil domestically than was imported, and gas prices are, and are expected to remain, near lows not seen in years.  Even if this were not the case, much of the tar sands oil that would run through this new pipeline would not be sold in the United States and would have no effect on domestic gas prices, but would instead pass through our nation for eventual sale on international markets. 

“Additionally, the long term economic benefits of this pipeline do not justify risking our nation's drinking water, farmlands, and tribal grounds.  Cleanup costs from a 2010 tar sands oil pipeline spill in Kalamazoo, Michigan have exceeded $1 billion. To add insult to injury, companies that produce, ship, or refine tar sands oil are not required to pay into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which conventional crude oil companies pay into,  and therefore the cost of cleaning up tar sands oil spills will fall on the American taxpayer.

""According to the State Department's Final Environmental Impact Statement, the project would only directly create 2,000 temporary jobs and few as 35 permanent jobs.  Last month, our economy grew by more than 250,000 jobs and is currently creating more jobs in two hours of an average work day than the temporary jobs that would be created by this project, and more jobs in one and a half average workday minutes than the permanent jobs created. 

""Instead of exempting foreign corporations from federal permitting requirements, Congress should be working on policies that diversify our nation’s energy portfolio, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, and support the President’s policies that have resulted in gas prices being reduced from $3.07 per gallon when he was sworn in in 2009 to $2.30 today.”

https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/nov/08/ben-carson/ben-carson-said-no-one-who-signed-declaration-inde/,"Tonight, going through all of your questions, I wanted to touch on a few issues that seem to be asked by many people.  
I would like to deal with one question tonight in some detail.  The issue is experience.  Several people ask what they should tell their friends when people say “I like Carson but he has no political experience”.  
You are absolutely right — I have no political experience.  The current Members of Congress have a combined 8,700 years of political experience.  Are we sure political experience is what we need.  Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no federal elected office experience.  What they had was a deep belief that freedom is a gift from God.  They had a determination to rise up against a tyrannical King.  They were willing to risk all they had, even their lives, to be free.  Today we find ourselves with an entire class of politicians.  No one in Philadelphia, during that summer our nation was born, dreamed that service was a career with a pension.  America was the land of the Citizen Statesmen.  They were merchants, lawyers, farmers — and yes, even doctors.  They were willing to stand for freedom.  Today, the political class stands in the way, not for the people.  They demand pensions and perks.  This is not what our Founders envisioned for America.  I spent my life treating very ill children.  Over 15,000 times I gave my all to prolong their lives.  I was blessed to do it.  But when it came time for me to retire, I simply could not sit back any longer.  These children became my family.  What our government is doing to them is outrageous.  I am prepared to risk all that I have to try and make a difference in their future. I built one of the nation’s best medical centers.  I served for two decades on the boards of Costco and Kellogg.  I built a national scholarship program.
My experience is very different than what we have come to expect.  I grew up poor.  I know what it is like to be homeless and hungry.  I know the pain of poverty.  I also know that education and a mother’s love can be the path out of dire poverty.  I know what it is like to see water fountains you are not allowed to drink out of because of your skin color.  I also know that once you peel back the skin, the brain is the same no matter what your skin color or continent you live on.  I know that victimhood is a trap.  I know that it is our Christian responsibility to offer those less fortunate a hand up.  I know my faith is strong and my ego is small.
I know that my path to the White House is different than most.  But I also know I bring all of the pain and joy, the success and failure, the lessons learned through love and sorrow in my life’s journey.  Bill Clinton was famous for saying “I feel your pain” — well, I have walked in your shoes.
I do not have political experience, I have a life journey.  A journey that not only made it possible for me to relate to so many different people, but also one where time and time again I was told I would fail, only to succeed.  My candidacy is different, that I grant you.  I have neither Donald Trump’s money or Jeb Bush’s political network.  However, I wouldn't trade a single child I treated for all of Trump’s money.  While I admire the Bush family’s dedication to service, I too served —  nights, weekends, holidays, birthdays and anniversaries with severely injured patients were my public service.
I didn’t go to embassy cocktail parties or beg lobbyists for money.  I spent night after night in a quiet, sterile room trying to save the life of a small child.  That was my life’s service.  This is my life’s experience.  What I have is a lifetime of caring, integrity and honesty.  I have experienced the American Dream.  No where in the world, other than America, could a man whose ancestors were slaves, rise to become a leading brain surgeon and one day seek the Office of President.
The very fact that I am running is testament to the greatness of America.  If all you want is political experience then I cannot be your candidate.
Thank you for staying up with me. 
Goodnight,   
Ben"
https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/sep/01/blog-posting/internet-posts-say-three-democratic-senators-took-/,"This is the most convincing reason we must get politicians who take campaign contributions from terrorist countries out of the picture. Our national security has been sold out to the Iranians for cold hard cash. If blood is shed it is on the hands of these idiots.
Daniel Greenfield at FrontPage Mag reports:

Senator Markey has announced his support for the Iran deal that will let the terrorist regime inspect its own Parchin nuclear weapons research site, conduct uranium enrichment, build advanced centrifuges, buy ballistic missiles, fund terrorism and have a near zero breakout time to a nuclear bomb. Markey had topped the list of candidates supported by the Iran Lobby. And the Iranian American Political Action Committee (IAPAC) had maxed out its contributions to his campaign.

After more fake suspense, Al Franken, another IAPAC backed politician who also benefited from Iran Lobby money, came out for the nuke sellout. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the Iran Lobby’s third Dem senator, didn’t bother playing coy like her colleagues. She came out for the deal a while back even though she only got half the IAPAC cash that Franken and Markey received. As did Senator Gillibrand, who had benefited from IAPAC money back when she first ran for senator and whose position on the deal should have come as no surprise.

In the House, the Democratic recipients of IAPAC money came out for the deal. Mike Honda, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Iran Lobby backed the nuke sellout. As did Andre Carson, Gerry Connolly, Donna Edwards and Jackie Speier. The Iran Lobby was certainly getting its money’s worth.

Both of Obama’s secretaries of state were involved in Iran Lobby cash controversies, as was his vice president and his former secretary of defense. Obama was also the beneficiary of sizable donations from the Iran Lobby. Akbar Ghahary, the former co-founder of IAPAC, had donated and raised some $50,000 for Obama.

The Iran Lobby had even tried, and failed, to turn Arizona Republican Jeff Flake. Iran Lobby cash had made the White House count on him as the Republican who would flip, but Flake came out against the deal. The Iran Lobby invested a good deal of time and money into Schumer, but that effort also failed.

Democrats in favor of a deal that will let a terrorist regime go nuclear have taken money from lobbies for that regime. They have broken their oath by taking bribes from a regime whose leaders chant, “Death to America”. Their pretense of examining the deal is nothing more than a hollow charade.

This deal has come down from Iran Lobby influenced politicians like Kerry and is being waved through by members of Congress who have taken money from the Iran Lobby. That is treason plain and simple.


Obama and his minions have traded not only America’s future, but the future of the world, for a pocketful of gold and a few years of power. They are all evil and they are all traitors, and they have been for many years. These are the vile, hypocrites who supposedly opposed nuclear weapons, war, and big money in politics. Words are insufficient to explain the extent of their betrayal.

The entire time that Obama and his demons have been enabling Iran, they have acted as if they are oblivious to the inevitable use of those weapons on this country and Israel. Do they think they will escape the consequences of a nuclear war? Or are they being given advance notice in return for their treason, so they can go somewhere safe?

They will not elude the consequences of this betrayal — the greatest in human history.

https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/jul/27/chuck-baldwin/no-300000-slave-owners-did-not-fight-union-side-ci/,"Ladies and gentlemen, I submit that what we see happening in the United States today is an apt illustration of why the Confederate flag was raised in the first place. What we see materializing before our very eyes is tyranny: tyranny over the freedom of expression, tyranny over the freedom of association, tyranny over the freedom of speech, and tyranny over the freedom of conscience.

 

In 1864, Confederate General Patrick Cleburne warned his fellow southerners of the historical consequences should the South lose their war for independence. He was truly a prophet. He said if the South lost, “It means that the history of this heroic struggle will be written by the enemy. That our youth will be trained by Northern school teachers; will learn from Northern school books their version of the war; will be impressed by all of the influences of History and Education to regard our gallant dead as traitors and our maimed veterans as fit subjects for derision.” No truer words were ever spoken.

 

History revisionists flooded America’s public schools with Northern propaganda about the people who attempted to secede from the United States, characterizing them as racists, extremists, radicals, hatemongers, traitors, etc. You know, the same way that people in our federal government and news media attempt to characterize Christians, patriots, war veterans, constitutionalists, et al. today.

 

Folks, please understand that the only people in 1861 who believed that states did NOT have the right to secede were Abraham Lincoln and his radical Republicans. To say that southern states did not have the right to secede from the United States is to say that the thirteen colonies did not have the right to secede from Great Britain. One cannot be right and the other wrong. If one is right, both are right. How can we celebrate our Declaration of Independence in 1776 and then turn around and condemn the Declaration of Independence of the Confederacy in 1861? Talk about hypocrisy!

 

In fact, southern states were not the only states that talked about secession. After the southern states seceded, the State of Maryland fully intended to join them. In September of 1861, Lincoln sent federal troops to the State capital and seized the legislature by force in order to prevent them from voting. Federal provost marshals stood guard at the polls and arrested Democrats and anyone else who believed in secession. A special furlough was granted to Maryland troops so they could go home and vote against secession. Judges who tried to inquire into the phony elections were arrested and thrown into military prisons. There is your great “emancipator,” folks.

 

And before the South seceded, several northern states had also threatened secession. Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island had threatened secession as far back as James Madison’s administration. In addition, the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware were threatening secession during the first half of the nineteenth century--long before the southern states even considered such a thing.

 

People say constantly that Lincoln “saved” the Union. Lincoln didn’t save the Union; he subjugated the Union. There is a huge difference. A union that is not voluntary is not a union. Does a man have a right to force a woman to marry him or to force a woman to stay married to him? In the eyes of God, a union of husband and wife is far superior to a union of states. If God recognizes the right of husbands and wives to separate (and He does), to try and suggest that states do not have the right to lawfully (under Natural and divine right) separate is the most preposterous proposition imaginable.

 

People say that Lincoln freed the slaves. Lincoln did NOT free a single slave. But what he did do was enslave free men. His so-called Emancipation Proclamation had NO AUTHORITY in the southern states, as they had separated into another country. Imagine a President today signing a proclamation to free folks in, say, China or Saudi Arabia. He would be laughed out of Washington. Lincoln had no authority over the Confederate States of America, and he knew it.

 

Do you not find it interesting that Lincoln’s proclamation did NOT free a single slave in the United States, the country in which he DID have authority? That’s right. The Emancipation Proclamation deliberately ignored slavery in the North. Do you not realize that when Lincoln signed his proclamation, there were over 300,000 slaveholders who were fighting in the Union army? Check it out.

 

One of those northern slaveholders was General (and later U.S. President) Ulysses S. Grant. In fact, he maintained possession of his slaves even after the War Between the States concluded. Recall that his counterpart, Confederate General Robert E. Lee, freed his slaves BEFORE hostilities between North and South ever broke out. When asked why he refused to free his slaves, Grant said, “Good help is hard to find these days.”

 

The institution of slavery did not end until the 13th Amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865.

 

Speaking of the 13th Amendment, did you know that Lincoln authored his own 13th Amendment? It is the only amendment to the Constitution ever proposed by a sitting U.S. President. Here is Lincoln’s proposed amendment: “No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give Congress the power to abolish or interfere within any state with the domestic institutions thereof, including that a person's held to labor or service by laws of said State.”

 

You read it right. Lincoln proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution PRESERVING the institution of slavery. This proposed amendment was written in March of 1861, a month BEFORE the shots were fired at Fort Sumter, South Carolina.

 

The State of South Carolina was particularly incensed at the tariffs enacted in 1828 and 1832. The Tariff of 1828 was disdainfully called, “The Tariff of Abominations” by the State of South Carolina. Accordingly, the South Carolina legislature declared that the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 were “unauthorized by the constitution of the United States.”

 

Think, folks: why would the southern states secede from the Union over slavery when President Abraham Lincoln had offered an amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing the PRESERVATION of slavery? That makes no sense. If the issue was predominantly slavery, all the South needed to do was to go along with Lincoln, and his proposed 13th Amendment would have permanently preserved slavery among the southern (and northern) states. Does that sound like a body of people who were willing to lose hundreds of thousands of men on the battlefield over saving slavery? What nonsense!

 

The problem was Lincoln wanted the southern states to pay the Union a 40% tariff on their exports. The South considered this outrageous and refused to pay. By the time hostilities broke out in 1861, the South was paying up to, and perhaps exceeding, 70% of the nation’s taxes. Before the war, the South was very prosperous and productive. And Washington, D.C., kept raising the taxes and tariffs on them. You know, the way Washington, D.C., keeps raising the taxes on prosperous American citizens today.

 

This is much the same story of the way the colonies refused to pay the demanded tariffs of the British Crown--albeit the tariffs of the Crown were MUCH lower than those demanded by Lincoln. Lincoln’s proposed 13th Amendment was an attempt to entice the South into paying the tariffs by being willing to permanently ensconce the institution of slavery into the Constitution. AND THE SOUTH SAID NO!

 

In addition, the Congressional Record of the United States forever obliterates the notion that the North fought the War Between the States over slavery. Read it for yourself. This resolution was passed unanimously in the U.S. Congress on July 23, 1861, “The War is waged by the government of the United States not in the spirit of conquest or subjugation, nor for the purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or institutions of the states, but to defend and protect the Union.”

 

What could be clearer? The U.S. Congress declared that the war against the South was NOT an attempt to overthrow or interfere with the “institutions” of the states, but to keep the Union intact (by force). The “institutions” implied most certainly included the institution of slavery.

 

Hear it loudly and clearly: Lincoln’s war against the South had NOTHING to do with ending slavery--so said the U.S. Congress by unanimous resolution in 1861.

 

Abraham Lincoln, himself, said it was NEVER his intention to end the institution of slavery. In a letter to Alexander Stevens who later became the Vice President of the Confederacy, Lincoln wrote this, “Do the people of the South really entertain fears that a Republican administration would directly, or indirectly, interfere with their slaves, or with them, about their slaves? If they do, I wish to assure you, as once a friend, and still, I hope, not an enemy, that there is no cause for such fears. The South would be in no more danger in this respect than it was in the days of Washington.”

 

Again, what could be clearer? Lincoln, himself, said the southern states had nothing to fear from him in regard to abolishing slavery.

 

Hear Lincoln again: “If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it.” He also said, “I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so and I have no inclination to do so.”

 

The idea that the Confederate flag (actually there were five of them) stood for racism, bigotry, hatred, and slavery is just so much hogwash. In fact, if one truly wants to discover who the racist was in 1861, just read the words of Mr. Lincoln.

 

On August 14, 1862, Abraham Lincoln invited a group of black people to the White House. In his address to them, he told them of his plans to colonize them all back to Africa. Listen to what he told these folks: “Why should the people of your race be colonized and where? Why should they leave this country? This is, perhaps, the first question for proper consideration. You and we are different races. We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races. Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss; but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both, as I think. Your race suffers very greatly, many of them, by living among us, while ours suffers from your presence. In a word, we suffer on each side. If this is admitted, it affords a reason, at least, why we should be separated. You here are freemen, I suppose? Perhaps you have been long free, or all your lives. Your race is suffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on any people. But even when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race. The aspiration of men is to enjoy equality with the best when free, but on this broad continent not a single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of our race.”

 

Did you hear what Lincoln said? He said that black people would NEVER be equal with white people--even if they all obtained their freedom from slavery. If that isn’t a racist statement, I’ve never heard one.

 

Lincoln’s statement above is not isolated. In Charleston, Illinois, in 1858, Lincoln said in a speech, “I am not, nor have ever been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races from living together on social or political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white.” 

 

Ladies and gentlemen, in his own words, Abraham Lincoln declared himself to be a white supremacist. Why don’t our history books and news media tell the American people the truth about Lincoln and about the War Between the States?

 

It’s simple: if people would study the meanings and history of the flag, symbols, and statues of the Confederacy and Confederate leaders, they might begin to awaken to the tyrannical policies of Washington, D.C., that precluded southern independence--policies that have only escalated since the defeat of the Confederacy--and they might have a notion to again resist.

 

By the time Lincoln penned his Emancipation Proclamation, the war had been going on for two years without resolution. In fact, the North was losing the war. Even though the South was outmanned and out-equipped, the genius of the southern generals and fighting acumen of the southern men had put the northern armies on their heels. Many people in the North never saw the legitimacy of Lincoln’s war in the first place, and many of them actively campaigned against it. These people were affectionately called “Copperheads” by people in the South.

 

I urge you to watch Ron Maxwell’s accurate depiction of those people in the North who favored the southern cause as depicted in his motion picture, “Copperhead.” For that matter, I consider his movie, “Gods And Generals” to be the greatest “Civil War” movie ever made. It is the most accurate and fairest depiction of Confederate General Thomas Jonathan “Stonewall” Jackson ever produced. In my opinion, actor Stephen Lang should have received an Oscar for his performance as General Jackson. But, can you imagine?

 

That’s another thing: the war fought from 1861 to 1865 was NOT a “civil war.” Civil war suggests two sides fighting for control of the same capital and country. The South didn’t want to take over Washington, D.C., no more than their forebears wanted to take over London. They wanted to separate from Washington, D.C., just as America’s Founding Fathers wanted to separate from Great Britain. The proper names for that war are either, “The War Between the States” or, “The War of Southern Independence,” or, more fittingly, “The War of Northern Aggression.”
 

Had the South wanted to take over Washington, D.C., they could have done so with the very first battle of the “Civil War.” When Lincoln ordered federal troops to invade Virginia in the First Battle of Manassas (called the “First Battle of Bull Run” by the North), Confederate troops sent the Yankees running for their lives all the way back to Washington. Had the Confederates pursued them, they could have easily taken the city of Washington, D.C., seized Abraham Lincoln, and perhaps ended the war before it really began. But General Beauregard and the others had no intention of fighting an aggressive war against the North. They merely wanted to defend the South against the aggression of the North. 

 

In order to rally people in the North, Lincoln needed a moral crusade. That’s what his Emancipation Proclamation was all about. This explains why his proclamation was not penned until 1863, after two years of fruitless fighting. He was counting on people in the North to stop resisting his war against the South if they thought it was some kind of “holy” war. Plus, Lincoln was hoping that his proclamation would incite blacks in the South to insurrect against southern whites. If thousands of blacks would begin to wage war against their white neighbors, the fighting men of the southern armies would have to leave the battlefields and go home to defend their families. THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

 

Not only did blacks not riot against the whites of the south, many black men volunteered to fight alongside their white friends and neighbors in the Confederate army. Unlike the blacks in the North, who were conscripted by Lincoln and forced to fight in segregated units, thousands of blacks in the South fought of their own free will in a fully-integrated southern army. I bet your history book never told you about that.

 

If one wants to ban a racist flag, one would have to ban the British flag. Ships bearing the Union Jack shipped over 5 million African slaves to countries all over the world, including the British colonies in North America. Other slave ships flew the Dutch flag and the Portuguese flag and the Spanish flag, and, yes, the U.S. flag. But not one single slave ship flew the Confederate flag. NOT ONE!

 

By the time Lincoln launched his war against the southern states, slavery was already a dying institution. The entire country, including the South, recognized the moral evil of slavery and wanted it to end. Only a small fraction of southerners even owned slaves. The slave trade had ended in 1808, per the U.S. Constitution, and the practice of slavery was quickly dying, too. In another few years, with the advent of agricultural machinery, slavery would have ended peacefully--just like it had in England. It didn’t take a national war and the deaths of over a half million men to end slavery in Great Britain. America’s so-called “Civil War” was absolutely unnecessary. The greed of Lincoln’s radical Republicans in the North, combined with the cold, calloused heart of Lincoln himself is responsible for the tragedy of the “Civil War.”

 

And look at what is happening now: in one instant--after one deranged young man killed nine black people and who ostensibly photo-shopped a picture of himself with a Confederate flag--the entire political and media establishments in the country go on an all-out crusade to remove all semblances of the Confederacy. The speed in which all of this has happened suggests that this was a planned, orchestrated event by the Powers That Be (PTB). And is it a mere coincidence that this took place at the exact same time that the U.S. Supreme Court decided to legalize same-sex marriage? I think not.

 

The Confederate Battle Flag flies the Saint Andrews cross. Of course, Andrew was the first disciple of Jesus Christ, brother of Simon Peter, and Christian martyr who was crucified on an X-shaped cross at around the age of 90. Andrew is the patron saint of both Russia and Scotland.

 

In the 1800s, up to 75% of people in the South were either Scotch or Scotch-Irish.  The Confederate Battle Flag is predicated on the national flag of Scotland. It is a symbol of the Christian faith and heritage of the Celtic race.

 

Pastor John Weaver rightly observed, “Even the Confederate States motto, ‘Deovendickia,’ (The Lord is our Vindicator), illustrates the sovereignty and the righteousness of God. The Saint Andrews cross is also known as the Greek letter CHIA (KEE) and has historically been used to represent Jesus Christ. Why do you think people write Merry X-mas, just to give you an illustration? The ‘X’ is the Greek letter CHIA and it has been historically used for Christ. Moreover, its importance was understood by educated and uneducated people alike. When an uneducated man, one that could not write, needed to sign his name please tell me what letter he made? An ‘X,’ why? Because he was saying I am taking an oath under God. I am recognizing the sovereignty of God, the providence of God and I am pledging my faith. May I tell you the Confederate Flag is indeed a Christian flag because it has the cross of Saint Andrew, who was a Christian martyr, and the letter ‘X’ has always been used to represent Christ, and to attack the flag is to deny the sovereignty, the majesty, and the might of the Lord Jesus Christ and his divine role in our history, culture, and life.”

 

Many of the facts that I reference in this column were included in a message delivered several years ago by Pastor John Weaver. I want to thank John for preaching such a powerful and needed message. Read or watch Pastor Weaver’s sermon “The Truth About The Confederate Battle Flag” here:

 

The Truth About The Confederate Battle Flag

 

Combine the current attacks against Biblical and traditional marriage, the attacks against all things Confederate, the attacks against all things Christian, and the attacks against all things constitutional and what we are witnessing is a heightened example of why the Confederate Battle Flag was created to begin with. Virtually every act of federal usurpation of liberty that we are witnessing today, and have been witnessing for much of the twentieth century, is the result of Lincoln’s war against the South. Truly, we are living in Lincoln’s America, not Washington and Jefferson’s America. Washington and Jefferson’s America died at Appomattox Court House in 1865. 

 

Instead of lowering the Confederate flag, we should be raising it.

https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/jul/16/blog-posting/did-vermont-pastor-get-sentenced-prison-refusing-m/,"Proctor, VT  —  According to NBC News, a pastor at the Christian Proctor Church in Vermont, has been sentenced to one year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples. This comes shortly after the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decisionruling that states must allow gay marriage.

The Christian Pastor, 56-year-old Paul Horner, had his lawyer speak to reporters on his behalf.

If you are a sports lover then you must have heard the name of famous tennis players Serena and Venus Williams. Serena Williams height and weight body is an American professional tennis player and former world’s no. 1 in women’s singles tennis.

“We are currently disputing the guilty verdict and I am confident my client will be a free man here shortly,” said attorney Tom Downey. “Horner was just using his best judgement according to his rights and religious freedom in this country.”

The Honorable Myron Danus handed down the harsh sentence.

“Religious freedom goes both ways, Mr. Horner,” Danus told a packed courtroom. “It is not your place to deny individuals the same rights that everyone else has, rights that were passed down and agreed upon in a court of law, the ultimate court, the Supreme Court. It is not your decision whether or not you agree with the law but more importantly that you follow it and enforce it.”

According to the criminal investigation, the Christian Proctor Church is registered with the state as a “religious corporation” limited to performing “one-man-one-woman marriages as defined by the Holy Bible.”

But the church is also registered as a for-profit business and city officials said that means the owners must comply with state and federal regulations.

Steve Shand president of the Vermont Family Research Committee, said it is “open season on Americans who refuse to bow to the government’s redefinition of marriage.”

“Homosexuals are gay,” Shand told reporters. “Why should Christian ministers be forced to perform and celebrate any marriage that conflicts with their beliefs? It’s a slippery slope my friend. Pretty soon these same pastors will be forced to wed animals or kitchen appliances. This is not my America!”

Gwen Hawkins who is president of the LGBT Pride Center in Vermont said she is happy with the guilty verdict.

“We just want the same rights as everyone else and this guilty verdict sets a great precedent,” Hawkins said. “These fanatical Christians base their life on one verse in the Bible but they seem to forget the other 99% of the verses in the book. For example, why can’t we stone to death Bristol Palin for having a baby out of wedlock? And what about her mother, Sarah Palin, breaking the rules of Corinthians 14:34 which clearly state that as a woman, she is not allowed to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. But no, they like to pick the one verse in the Bible about gay people and build their camp around it.”

Proctor is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,741 at the 2010 census. Proctor is home to the Vermont Marble Museum, Wilson Castle and the only marble bridge in America."

https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/mar/27/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/has-scott-walker-been-rated-most-factually-challen/,"The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau yesterday released an analysis of Scott Walker’s budget that shows it raises taxes and fees by $48 million and raids segregated funds by more than $300 million, part of another round of broken campaign promises for the governor and presidential candidate who has been rated America’s most factually-challenged politician.

But Scott Walker’s ""Broken Promises"" budget doesn’t just raise taxes and raid segregated funds; it also includes policy items and fails to use Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, two more promises broken in Walker’s first term and now broken again.

Taxes

In his first campaign for governor, Walker signed Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform Taxpayer Protection Pledge which promised he would ""oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.""  

But contrary to his tax-cutting rhetoric, Walker’s first budget raised taxes on seniors and working families by nearly $70 million and raised fees by $133 million, including a massive increase in fees for the UW System. Walker’s tax hike was enough to merit a “Promise Broken” fromPolitiFact Wisconsin in May of 2011, which wrote that Walker broke the ATR pledge because he not only failed to oppose tax increases, but he was the one who proposed them.

Walker’s current budget doubles down on the broken promise by would increasing taxes by $39.4 million and fees by another $8.6 million, according to a summary released by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

Segregated Funds

Back in 2010, Walker promised that he would ""end the practice of raiding segregated state funds to pay for other programs. If taxpayer revenue is collected for a specific purpose such as building and maintaining roads, it should be used for that purpose and that purpose only.""

But it was another promise not long for this world – a July 2011 memo from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau showed that Walker’s first budget transferred more than $400 million in funds to “be used for purposes other than those for which the fund has traditionally been used.” That was good for another “Promise Broken” from PolitiFact.

With Wisconsin facing a self-inflicted $2.2 billion deficit as he crafted his budget, Walker decided the segregated funds broken promise was worth recycling, and uses more than $300 million in segregated funds for purposes other than their original intention, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

Policy Items in Budget

This is one of Scott Walker’s most egregious broken promises. Even though he promised to ""strip policy and pork projects from the state budget” because “the budget process should be about funding essential government services based on the taxpayers’ ability to pay,” Walker has consistently used his budget to ram through contentious non-fiscal policy items, and his latest budget is no different.

This time around, Walker’s budget: includes a statewide expansion of unaccountable voucher schools; rolls back teacher licensure requirements; removes legislative oversight of the scandal-plagued Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation; eliminates the power of the Boards at the Departments of Natural Resources and Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection; effectively ends the state’s Stewardship Program; mandates drug testing for working Wisconsinites, to include veterans, soldiers, and military spouses, to receive unemployment benefits and food assistance.

Walker’s first budget contained more than 45 non-fiscal items including a proposal to defund Planned Parenthood, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, earning Walker a “Promise Broken” from PolitiFact back in April of 2011. That’s in addition to Walker’s most famous non-fiscal budget item, his contentious Act 10 legislation that eliminated collective bargaining for public employees through a “budget repair bill.”

Use GAAP

Any way you count it, Scott Walker has been a fiscally irresponsible “borrow and spend” governor – his latest budget borrows nearly a billion dollars and delays more than $100 million in debt repayment. But back in 2010 he promised to count it a particular way, using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Using GAAP, Wisconsin is forecast to have a nearly $2 billion deficit by the end of the current biennium.

In his first campaign, Walker promised he would ""require the use of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to balance every state budget, just as we require every local government and school district to do.""

According to PolitiFact Wisconsin’s “Promise Broken” rating in November 2011, a document prepared by the Walker administration shows that, “based on GAAP accounting, the state would have been left with a deficit of $3 billion by 2012-13 under Walker's budget. That compares to the $2.9 billion GAAP deficit he inherited at the end of Doyle's term, the state's financial statements show… The governor's office told us to judge this promise based on the next budget -- for 2013-15. Walker, though, promised to balance ""every” state budget on the more stringent GAAP principles. He did not do that in his first budget.”

And he didn’t do it in his second budget either; the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that the state GAAP deficit would grow to $2.64 billion from $2.06 billion with Walker’s second budget.

Unfortunately the third time wasn’t the charm. The Department of Administration’s “Budget in Brief” shows a $1.96 billion deficit using GAAP by the end of 2017."
https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/feb/09/urban-intellectuals/blog-sheriffs-group-cried-obama-be-hanged/,"President Obama is a lightening rod for criticism, as to be expected. This is part of the job that comes along with being POTUS. However, the blatant racism and calls for his death have everything to do with the color of his skin and the hatred in the hearts and minds of some people….but Sheriffs?

Members of the ultra right wing Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association and their leader, Sheriff Richard Mack, went to Washington DC during December for a meeting with some GOP congressional leaders. Mach sat down with Senators Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and David Vitter (R-LA), and Rep. Martha Blackburn (R-TN) in the Senate building on Dec. 10th.

Sheriff-Richard-Mack-with-GOP-Senators-and-House-reps.The details of the meeting were not disclosed, but outside of the building a small protest of right wingers who are not pleased with Obama, his Immigration policy or anything else gathered to voice their displeasure with the world the President is doing.

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Hate Watch, the small gathering of disgruntled sheriffs and officers were chanting.

[ADSENSE2]
Here is what they said:

A small group of protesters supporting the sheriffs gathered at the White House and began shouting slogans and demanding the removal of President Obama. Some in the crowd demanded the president be lynched–”Hang the lying Muslim traitor!” one of them shouted.

Sheriff Mack tried to distance himself, the Senators and the Representative after the meeting from the group of protestors with his words, but it became obvious they were all together.

The same group of protesters then proceeded to the Senate building where the sheriffs were meeting, but were not permitted inside and instead lingered in the foyer. When the meeting ended, the demonstrators lustily greeted the emerging law enforcement officers and Congress members, some of them shaking hands and hugging the participants.

You might remember Sheriff Mack from his suggestion of using women as human shields while defending Cliven Bundy, the man who claimed to have sovereign rights to his ranch a few years back. It seems like his delusion and hatred of the President hasn’t waived since.

How Can You Threaten The President?
In this world of cracking down on dangerous rhetoric, how is it possible for someone to stand outside government buildings in DC and threaten the President of the United States?
