Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_605527,"Hollywood legend Tom Selleck has praised Donald J. Trump as President of the United States. In a meeting with Breitbart News, the legendary American actor stated: “I’m completely sure that he is the best so far. 

I’m saying I like this guy.” “He’s an answer to our problems. We need to get behind him. The Republicans need to unite behind this man. We need somebody to go in and reconstruct us in a sort of way, get us back to where we were, who we need to be.”
Then he continued with something truly remarkable:
“Donald is funny, playful, and colorful, but most of all, he is honest. When he decided to run for president, I know he did it with a true conviction to bring this country back to prosperity. He is the only one who can do it. No frills, no fuss, only candid truths.”
“I am very disappointed at the talk show hosts, also spewing out lies and propaganda against Donald. Why, I wonder? The only thing I can think of is he represents a form of freedom none of them ever saw before, and they are bewildered about it, and frightened about it.

I would say “f*ck you” to all of them. To all that are criticizing him for no reason and want him to resign for no reason. Just go to hell all of you!”
“I pray all Americans who have seen and felt the meltdown of America with the Obama years, to please fight for Donald Trump. He will not let us down. I pray for all good people to see clearly what faces us now. The right vote will save our nation.”
Selleck additionally noticed that Trump’s capacity to keep up an inspirational demeanor despite the fact that “he has individuals assaulting him from each side” was likewise a solid contention.

This is outstanding people. This guy is a true legend. Thanks for this statement sir. Please SHARE this article with your friends to show this great praise of Tom Selleck."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_868147,"Hundreds of Congolese migrants, with who knows what sorts of diseases given that the nation is chock full of Ebola, were unexpectedly dumped in San Antonio.

Breitbart reported:

San Antonio officials scrambled this week to find French-speaking volunteers to help with hundreds of Congolese migrants arriving in the Alamo City.

“We didn’t get a heads up,” Interim Assistant City Manager Dr. Collen Bridger told KEN 5 after a group of 350 Congolese migrants arrived in the city unexpectedly. “When we called Border Patrol to confirm, they said, ‘yea another 200 to 300 from the Congo and Angola will be coming to San Antonio.’”

Bridger told the local CBS affiliate that they are looking for volunteers who can speak French. “If you speak primarily French and can come spend six, seven, eight hours, that would be really helpful,” Bridger explained.

The City of San Antonio apparently expected to be able to move the Congolese migrants along to Portland, Maine. “When we reached out to Portland Maine they said, ‘Please don’t send us any more. We’re already stretched way beyond our capacity,” Bridger stated. Instead, the City is now attempting to locate other localities that will accept these migrants.

South and central African migrants began illegally crossing the South Texas border on May 30 when 117 migrants from the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Angola crossed in the Del Rio Sector.

By June 5, more than 500 African migrants had crossed illegally in this single Border Patrol sector, Breitbart News reported.

In a press call on Wednesday afternoon, Brian Hastings, U.S. Border Patrol Chief of Law Enforcement Operations, told reporters this was the first large group “ever recorded in Border Patrol history solely from Central and South Africa. We’ve never seen that demographic in a large group of that size before.”

Two weeks before the illegal crossings began in the Del Rio Sector, hundreds of African migrants gathered near an international bridge in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, to protest not being allowed entry into the U.S. through a legal port of entry, Breitbart News reported.

The group complained that Cuban migrants are being given preferential treatment.

Since that time, multiple groups of African migrants, mostly family units, crossed in the same area in large numbers. On June 5, agents apprehended another group of 34 African migrants bringing the total to more than 500 in less than a week.

“The introduction of this new population places additional burdens on processing stations, to include language and cultural differences,” Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul L. Ortiz said in a written statement. “Our agents continue to meet each new challenge as the ongoing humanitarian crisis evolves.”

This isn’t a ‘humanitarian crisis,’ it is an INVASION."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_479625,"A week after he told voters that the Second Amendment doesn’t protect “a magazine with a hundred clips in it,” 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden offered supporters more of his singular brand of anti-gun nonsense. While attending a private campaign event in Seattle, the former vice president reportedly called for a ban on 9mm pistols.

According to an article from the Seattle Times, Biden was in town to attend two private fundraisers, one of which was at the home of “a top Amazon executive.” The posh soiree set attendees back a princely $2,800 per-person. The other fundraiser was held at the home of a local philanthropist. That staider event offered donors a relative bargain with a $500 minimum price tag.

While speaking to attendees of the latter event, Biden claimed that he supports the Second Amendment. The 77-year-old then went on to ask “Why should we allow people to have military-style weapons including pistols with 9mm bullets and can hold 10 or more rounds?” Biden also shared his tired and inaccurate claim that because there is a shot-shell restriction for migratory bird hunting, “We protect geese from Canada more than we do people.”

In targeting 9mm pistols, Biden has called for a ban on one of the most popular firearms in America. According to ATF’s Firearms Commerce in the United States FY 2019, there were over 3.6 million pistols manufactured in the U.S. in 2017. This was more than 1 million more guns than the next most popular category of firearms, rifles. Further, over 3.2 million handguns (including revolvers) were imported in to the U.S. in 2017.

In its annual report on the U.S. firearms industry, Shooting Industry reported that 9mm caliber pistols are the most commonly produced pistol and have been for many years. In 2017 alone, there were more than 1.7 million 9mm pistols produced in the U.S. Cumulatively there are tens of millions of 9mm pistols in the hands of law-abiding Americans. 

The 9mm pistol is the choice of the nation’s leading civilian law enforcement agency, the FBI. Moreover, 9mm pistols are used by countless other federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies. Biden alluded to the 9mm handgun’s military applications, but these agencies are not tasked with waging war on the public, but rather defending the public. This defensive application is the same reason that millions of Americans have chosen a 9mm pistol as their self-defense firearm. 

The landmark Second Amendment U.S. Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller concerned a complete prohibition on the ownership of handguns in Washington, D.C. The opinion made clear that the Second Amendment at a minimum protects the right to acquire and possess firearms “in common use at the time” for lawful purposes such as self-defense.

It is impossible to square Biden’s statement with the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Second Amendment. Many types of firearms, such as the AR-15, are “in common use” for lawful purposes like self-defense and therefore protected under the Second Amendment. The 9mm pistol is not just “in common use” for self-defense. As the production statistics indicate, it may be the most common firearm in use for self-defense. Therefore, it is not permissible under the Second Amendment for a jurisdiction to prohibit 9mm pistols. The law-abiding 9mm pistol-owning residents of the D.C., Chicago, and a handful of Chicago suburbs are a testament to this fact.

Biden’s political career is an ongoing spectacle of anti-gun incompetence. However, his high-profile gaffes can serve an instructive purpose. Biden is emblematic of a political class that cannot be bothered to learn the most rudimentary information concerning firearms and the right to keep and bear arms. Despite nearly four decades in the U.S. Senate and eight years as vice president, he is still a complete ignoramus on the subject. Biden and his cohort don’t want to know anything about guns, gun rights, or gun owners. Rather, they prefer to mindlessly indulge their anti-gun prejudice at every opportunity."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_914959,"A Proof has recently appeared that cash attached to Hillary Clinton and George Soros was utilized to pay ladies to make-up false claims that President Trump sexually attacked them, as per a report in the New York Times.

Writing for TheHill, analytical columnist John Solomon, uncovers that payouts were made by lawyer Lisa Bloom to ladies who were willing to lie and act in public that they were sexually attacked by now President Donald Trump. The cash was attractive, so they decided to do it.

As indicated by the report, one of the accusers had the mortgage on her home paid off, while the other was offered cash amount of $750,000.

The names of two of were uncovered by the NY Times and both are attached to the evilness. Guess who? George Soros and Hillary Clinton.

Radical environmental extremists and Hollywood celebrities have blamed the fires on climate change. But it turns out — climate change has nothing to do with the humanitarian crisis unfolding Down Under.

It turns out — many of the fires were set by arsonists.

The Australian reports more than 180 people have been arrested since the start of the bushfire season.

Swinburne University professor James Ogloff told the newspaper about 50 percent of bushfires were lit by firebugs and impending fire seasons excited them.

“They’re interested in seeing fire, interested in setting fire and quite often the information around how fires burn and accelerate excites them,” Ogloff told the newspaper.

Note that the professor mentioned the “impending fire seasons.” The bushfires are a regular occurence in Australia.

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack dismissed concerns that climate change had anything to do with the massive fires. He blamed the outcry on “raving inner-city lefties” who were ignoring the needs of rural Australians.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_45685,"The Chinese Communist Party will finally admit that the real source of the coronavirus is from “a lab in Wuhan” linked to its covert biological weapon programs.

As the “novel” coronavirus originated in Wuhan is spreading to ten countries, more and more people including international bio-weapon experts are questioning its link to the Wuhan P4 lab located about 20 miles from a seafood market where the first few cases of human infections were found.

A reliable source told Miles Guo today that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will admit to the public of an “accidental” leak of lab-created virus from a P4 lab in Wuhan to put blames on “human errors”. But the official announcement is still being finalized.

Initially, the Chinese communist’s propaganda machines were blaming the virus on wild animals like bats by showing many videos of people eating bats.

(Please click here to view the bat-eating images which are too disturbing to be shown here. )

In January 2018, a bio-safety level four (BSL-4) laboratory was built in the city of Wuhan, which focuses on the control of emerging diseases and stores purified SARS and other types of viruses. It is supposed to act as a WHO ‘reference laboratory’ linked to similar labs around the world.

Here is a Chinese video of the P4 lab which took over ten years to build:

The remaining question is whether the Chinese Communist Party leaked the virus on purpose as a desperate attempt to stay in power. There is no final conclusion yet, but the Chinese Communist Party acted suspiciously before, during and after the first case of Wuhan pneumonia:

Wang Qishan visited Wuhan secretly during the time of the first “sign” of the deadly virus.
The Chinese top kleptocrats like Han Zheng did not respond to any early reports of the mysterious Wuhan pneumonia sent by the government of Hubei province.
The Chinese government deliberately covered up and delayed the reporting and containment of the mysterious pneumonia.
The Chinese kleptocrat Wang Qishan, the Vice President of China, told his friend confidently that the outbreak would end in February while the epidemic is spreading out of control.
The Chinese government deliberately abandon the residents, patients and medical staff at the epicenter without providing food, medical supplies or protective gear.
The Chinese top kleptocrats handle the outbreak with a nonchalant attitude. Instead of talking or acting in ways to show concerns, they were celebrating Chinese New Year as if nothing has happened.
The Chinese government has not done a lot to reduce the spread of the disease except for sending military forces to prevent people from escaping their cities or villages on lockdown.
The Chinese government allows the fear to spread nationally and internationally to create an almost doomsday-like scene.
The Chinese government rejected aid, monitoring, donation or assistance from the WHO to keep the epidemic in a black box.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_403414,"Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab. Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.

Coronavirus Bioweapon – How Chinese agents stole Coronavirus from Canada and weaponized it into a Bioweapon

The Saudi SARS Sample

On June 13, 2012 a 60-year-old Saudi man was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a 7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath. He had no history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was receiving no long-term medications, and did not smoke.

Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from his lungs. After routine diagnostics failed to identify the causative agent, Zaki contacted Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for advice. 

Abnormalities on Chest Imaging of the Saudi patient infected with Coronavirus. Shown are chest radiographs of the patient on the day of admission (Panel A) and 2 days later (Panel B) and computed tomography (CT) 4 days after admission (Panel C).

Fouchier sequenced the virus from a sample sent by Zaki. Fouchier used a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to test for distinguishing features of a number of known coronaviruses known to infect humans.

This Coronavirus sample was acquired by Scientific Director Dr. Frank Plummer of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg directly from Fouchier, who received it from Zaki. This virus was reportedly stolen from the Canadian lab by Chinese agents.

The Canadian Lab

Coronavirus arrived at Canada’s NML Winnipeg facility on May 4, 2013 from the Dutch lab. The Canadian lab grew up stocks of the virus and used it to assess diagnostic tests being used in Canada. Winnipeg scientists worked to see which animal species can be infected with the new virus.

Research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases which is housed in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory.

NML has a long history of offering comprehensive testing services for coronaviruses. It isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus and identified another coronavirus NL63 in 2004.

This Winnipeg based Canadian lab was targeted by Chinese agents in what could be termed as Biological Espionage.

Chinese Biological Espionage

In March 2019, in mysterious event a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML ended up in China. The event caused a major scandal with Bio-warfare experts questioning why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China. Scientists from NML said the highly lethal viruses were a potential bio-weapon.

Following investigation, the incident was traced to Chinese agents working at NML. Four months later in July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were forcibly dispatched from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc.

Xiangguo Qiu – The Chinese Bio-Warfare Agent

The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu. Qiu was the head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section in the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML.

Xiangguo Qiu is an outstanding Chinese scientist born in Tianjin. She primarily received her medical doctor degree from Hebei Medical University in China in 1985 and came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. Later on, she was affiliated with the Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, not engaged with studying pathogens. 

Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, the Chinese Biological Warfare Agent working at the National Microbiology Laboratory, Canada

But a shift took place, somehow. Since 2006, she has been studying powerful viruses in Canada’s NML. The viruses shipped from the NML to China were studied by her in 2014, for instance (together with the viruses Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Hendra).

Infiltrating the Canadian Lab

Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is married to another Chinese scientist – Dr. Keding Cheng, also affiliated with the NML, specifically the “Science and Technology Core”. Dr. Cheng is primarily a bacteriologist who shifted to virology. The couple is responsible for infiltrating Canada’s NML with many Chinese agents as students from a range of Chinese scientific facilities directly tied to China’s Biological Warfare Program, namely:

Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun
Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region
Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei
Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing

Sources say Xiangguo Qiu and her husband Keding Cheng were escorted from the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg on July 5, 2019. Since then, the University of Manitoba has ended their appointments, reassigned her graduate students, and cautioned staff, students and faculty about traveling to China. (Governor General’s Innovation Awards)

All of the above four mentioned Chinese Biological Warfare facilities collaborated with Dr. Xiangguo Qiu within the context of Ebola virus, the Institute of Military Veterinary joined a study on the Rift Valley fever virus too, while the Institute of Microbiology joined a study on Marburg virus. Noticeably, the drug used in the latter study – Favipiravir – has been earlier tested successfully by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, with the designation JK-05 (originally a Japanese patent registered in China already in 2006), against Ebola and additional viruses.

However, the studies by Dr. Qiu are considerably more advanced and apparently vital for the Chinese biological weapons development in case Coronavirus, Ebola, Nipah, Marburg or Rift Valley fever viruses are included therein.

The Canadian investigation is ongoing and questions remain whether previous shipments to China of other viruses or other essential preparations, took place from 2006 to 2018, one way or another.

(Submitted by Health Canada)

Dr. Xiangguo Qiu also collaborated in 2018 with three scientists from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Maryland, studying post-exposure immunotherapy for two Ebola viruses and Marburg virus in monkeys; a study supported by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

The Wuhan Coronavirus

Dr. Xiangguo Qiu made at least five trips over the school year 2017-18 to the above mentioned Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was certified for BSL4 in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved research activities involving Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses at the Wuhan facility.

Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus.

The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is housed at the Chinese military facility Wuhan Institute of Virology linked to China’s Biological Warfare Program. It was the first ever lab in the country designed to meet biosafety-level-4 (BSL-4) standards – the highest biohazard level, meaning that it would be qualified to handle the most dangerous pathogens. 

In January 2018, the lab was operational ‘for global experiments on BSL-4 pathogens,’ wrote Guizhen Wu in the journal Biosafety and Health. ‘After a laboratory leak incident of SARS in 2004, the former Ministry of Health of China initiated the construction of preservation laboratories for high-level pathogens such as SARS, coronavirus, and pandemic influenza virus,’ wrote Guizhen Wu.

Coronavirus Bioweapon

The Wuhan institute has studied coronaviruses in the past, including the strain that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, H5N1 influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. Researchers at the institute also studied the germ that causes anthrax – a biological agent once developed in Russia.

“Coronaviruses (particularly SARS) have been studied in the institute and are probably held therein,” said Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese biowarfare. He said. “SARS is included within the Chinese BW program, at large, and is dealt with in several pertinent facilities.”

James Giordano, a neurology professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in Biowarfare at the U.S. Special Operations Command, said China’s growing investment in bio-science, looser ethics around gene-editing and other cutting-edge technology and integration between government and academia raise the spectre of such pathogens being weaponized. 

That could mean an offensive agent, or a modified germ let loose by proxies, for which only China has the treatment or vaccine. “This is not warfare, per se,” he said. “But what it’s doing is leveraging the capability to act as global saviour, which then creates various levels of macro and micro economic and bio-power dependencies.”

China’s Biological Warfare Program

In a 2015 academic paper, Shoham – of Bar-Ilan’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies – asserts that more than 40 Chinese facilities are involved in bio-weapon production.

China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences actually developed an Ebola drug – called JK-05 — but little has been divulged about it or the defence facility’s possession of the virus, prompting speculation its Ebola cells are part of China’s bio-warfare arsenal, Shoham told the National Post.

Ebola is classified as a “category A” bioterrorism agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning it could be easily transmitted from person to person, would result in high death rates and “might cause panic.” The CDC lists Nipah as a category C substance, a deadly emerging pathogen that could be engineered for mass dissemination.

China’s Biological Warfare Program is believed to be in an advanced stage that includes research and development, production and weaponization capabilities. Its current inventory is believed to include the full range of traditional chemical and biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles.

Weaponizing Biotech

China’s national strategy of military-civil fusion has highlighted biology as a priority, and the People’s Liberation Army could be at the forefront of expanding and exploiting this knowledge.

The PLA is pursuing military applications for biology and looking into promising intersections with other disciplines, including brain science, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence. Since 2016, the Central Military Commission has funded projects on military brain science, advanced biomimetic systems, biological and biomimetic materials, human performance enhancement, and “new concept” biotechnology.

In 2016, an AMMS doctoral researcher published a dissertation, “Research on the Evaluation of Human Performance Enhancement Technology,” which characterized CRISPR-Cas as one of three primary technologies that might boost troops’ combat effectiveness. The supporting research looked at the effectiveness of the drug Modafinil, which has applications in cognitive enhancement; and at transcranial magnetic stimulation, a type of brain stimulation, while also contending that the “great potential” of CRISPR-Cas as a “military deterrence technology in which China should “grasp the initiative” in development.

In 2016, the potential strategic value of genetic information led the Chinese government to launch the National Genebank, which intends to become the world’s largest repository of such data. It aims to “develop and utilize China’s valuable genetic resources, safeguard national security in bioinformatics, and enhance China’s capability to seize the strategic commanding heights” in the domain of Biotechnology Warfare.

Chinese military’s interest in biology as an emerging domain of warfare is guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” and the possibility of a “bloodless victory.”"

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_551544,"January 29, 2020 – On Monday, federal prosecutors charged former state Sen. Martin Sandoval with accepting a bribe in exchange for opposing legislation that would harm the red-light camera industry.

They also charged him with one count of filing a false income tax return.

Silent Sean Casten, once again, failed to stand up to his party bosses in Illinois.

Just as he refused to stand up to Mike Madigan and his cronies when it was learned that they allegedy covered up a rape and fostered a culture of abuse in Springfield, Casten has said nothing about Marty Sandoval’s bribery changes.

When Sandoval staged a mock assassination of the President at a fundraiser in the 6th district, Casten said nothing.

Yet, he demanded the impeachment of the Republican President before the Mueller report was even released. And he couldn’t have been quicker to hype the impeachment of Conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on completely bogus allegations.

Then, Casten turns around and tells a group of voters, “Because we are still a nation where the majority of people voted for Hillary Clinton, we are still a nation where the majority are good people.” Hillary Clinton’s career is easily one of the most well-documented cases of political corruption in American History.

“Now, I understand Sean Casten may feel a little sheepish commenting on another Democrat’s tax fraud, since it was recently revealed that Casten himself was committing tax fraud,” said Jeanne Ives. “Ignoring corruption and refusing to use your platform to expose wrong-doing might keep you in favor with party bosses, but it also makes you complicit in your party’s culture of abuse. Worse still, going after the wrong-doings of your political opponents with the energy of 1,000 solar-powered windmills, while ignoring the serious problems in your own party, makes you a bitter partisan.”

As a state representative, Ives spoke out against Speaker Madigan’s culture of cronyism and abuse.  But she also stood up to Republican when they passed unbalanced budgets, tax hikes and crony bailouts.

“As a legislator, you are trusted to stand up for the people you represent against increasingly powerful politicians and party leaders,” said Ives. “This is your party now, Sean Casten. You have the power stand up to the corruption right in front of you, and you refuse to do it. If you won’t lead, then step aside. I will.”"

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_85264,"The ""novel Coronavirus"" outbreak affecting China and many other countries right now, has been determined to be a military BIO-WEAPON, which was being worked on at the Wuhan Virology Laboratory by China's People's Liberation Army, Nanjiang Command.  Somehow, it got out.  The world is now facing a massive wipe-out of humanity as a result.

The proof that this virus is a genetically-modified Bat-SARS-Like Virus, manipulated by the Chinese Army, appears below.  The evidence is irrefutable.

Two separate components of genetic sequencing from HIV-1,  the virus which causes AIDS, were added to Bat-SARS-Like coronavirus in the laboratory, thereby allowing it to infect human lungs via the ACES2 receptors in our lungs, and to disrupt the human body ability to fight it off, by reducing human leukocytes.

BIO-WEAPON PROOF

Make no mistake: this disease is, in fact, a MILITARY biological weapon.   The disease sequence from the original Bat coronavirus was uploaded to the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the US National Library of Medicine, in the year 2018 by China's Institute of Military Medicine, Nanjing Command.  The image below from the National Center for Biotechnology Information proves the upload (Click image to enlarge):

That Bat-SARS-Like coronavirus was issued Reference ID: AVP 70833.1 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the U.S. Library of Medicine.

The present outbreak of ""novel Coronavirus"" was uploaded to that same National Center for Biotechnology Information in January of this year by the Shanghai Public Heath Clinical Center and was issued Reference ID: QHD3418.1.  Here is proof of THAT upload (Click image to enlarge):

Using the test facilities known as BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) from the U.S. National Library of Medicine researchers have determined that the ""virus envelope"" of those two separate diseases, are 100% identical!   Here is the BLAST Test result (Click image to enlarge):

MORE:  a new study shows that elements of HIV have been found in the new ""novel coronavirus!""   From that study:

We are currently witnessing a major epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV). The evolution of 2019-nCoV remains elusive. We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity /similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.

LINK TO STUDY HERE

There is no way in nature that the Bat coronavirus could fortuitously acquire the HIV genetic sequences, without causing a mutation of the Virus Envelope.   The ONLY way the virus envelope could obtain the HIV genetics and still remain 100% identical to the 2018 sample, is if the HIV genes were added in a laboratory.

So what the human race is now facing, is an accidentally-released military bio-weapon.  The original Bat-SARS-Like Coronavirus was identified by China's People's Liberation Army, through the Institute of Military Medicine, Nanjiang Command in the year 2018.  They uploaded the virus sequence and they were the sole entity in possession of the virus.

Here we are, two years later, and the virus they had has been changed in a way that cannot occur in nature without mutating the virus envelope protein.  

This isn't rocket science; this is as plain as day.  China conducted genetic manipulation of their Bat-SARS-like virus and created a new virus capable of infecting humans.  That new virus was apparently accidentally-released and is the ""novel coronavirus"" the world is now battling.

I am sorry to have to report, many of us are very likely to LOSE this battle.  Just like many are already losing their battle inside China and elsewhere.

QUARANTINE

Within the first month of this outbreak in China, the government there effectively QUARANTINED more than fifty-six MILLION people (56,000,000) in nineteen (19) major cities, even though China reported publicly that only a few hundred were infected and only about 25 had died by that time.

WHY?

Why would China lockdown 19 cities and effectively Quarantine 56 Million people for such a trivial disease?   Because China KNEW it wasn't trivial.  China KNEW it was a military bio-weapon which had accidentally gotten out.  And China also KNEW how far this would spread and how fast.  China is guilty as sin.

DISEASE FACTS:

Here are the now-established FACTS about this disease:

This disease has an eighty-three percent (83%) infection rate.  That means if 100 people are EXPOSED to this virus, 83 WILL get sick from it.

The Disease can spread by AIR.  It is HIGHLY, HIGHLY contagious.

When a person breathes, virus comes out with those breaths.  Same thing when a person sneezes or coughs. Same when urinating or having a bowel movement.  ALL OF IT HAS VIRUS IN IT.

The virus can live OUTSIDE a person, in the air or on a surface, for a minimum of five days, and a maximum of twenty eight days.

So if an infected person goes into a store or supermarket, or public bathroom, or a school, office, warehouse . . . . or anywhere . . . . touches products on shelves and puts anything back, or sneezes or coughs, his virus gets on the products in that store or supermarket, bathroom, school, office, warehouse, etc., and can survive.

YOU walk-in a couple minutes, hours or even DAYS later, and pick up the same item, or even smell their stink in the bathroom - POW, you're infected.

WORSE: This virus can infect others through the eyes and ears.   

Let's say you're walking inside somewhere and an infected person was there minutes earlier and coughed or sneezed.   The cough or sneeze threw microscopic droplets into the air, which float for awhile.  A few minutes later, you walk through that air.  One or more of the microscopic droplets gets on your eye.  You don't even KNOW it because the things are so small.   

You blink.  We all blink.

Your eye lid pushes the virus off the surface of your eye, down into the bottom eye area, and the virus washes down into your tear duct.  POW- you're infected.

It cannot be overstated that this virus is the worst public disease crisis the world has faced in over 100 years.  Not since the Spanish Flu of 1918 has the world faced such death and this is already heading toward being far WORSE than the Spanish Flu.

The Spanish Flu spread worldwide during 1918-1919.  In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States.

When a disease outbreak occurs, one of the measurements that scientists use to see how badly the disease will spread is known as R0.

The 1918-1919 pandemic-causing Spanish flu is estimated to have had an R0 ranging from 1.4 – 2.8, with a mean of 2.  This means that for every person infected, that person could be expected to infect another 1.4 to 2.8 additional people.

I regret to report that the R0 of this Bio-Weapon is already showing itself to be R4.08   . . .  FAAAAAAR Worse than the 1918 Spanish Flu.

Here's where things get very bad, very fast.

According to Satistia, the number of all hospital beds in the U.S. 1975-2017, is decreasing. In 1975, there were about 1.5 million hospital beds in the U.S., but until 2017 the number dropped to just about 931 thousand. Aug 9, 2019  (HERE)

According to TrendingEconomics, Hospital beds (per 1,000 people) in United States was reported at 2.9 in 2013, according to the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources. Hospital beds include inpatient beds available in public, private, general, and specialized hospitals and rehabilitation centers. (Here)

Using the Infection Rate of 83% listed above, out of 1,000 people exposed to this Bio-Weapon, 830 will become infected.

There are 2.9 Hospital beds per thousand US citizens.  So when 830 people get infected, how many can those 2.9 hospital beds hold???????   Yea.  2.9

What happens to the rest?   They cannot get hospital care.

Right now, when a person cannot get hospital care for this disease, the death rate for such people is 65-70%.

That means me and you.  Dead.

IT CAN (AND PROBABLY WILL) HAPPEN HERE

Many of the 56 Million people in 19 Quarantined cities have not eaten in days because there is no food remaining in the cities.  This is causing rioting.

Delivery trucks are prohibited from entering these contaminated cities, for fear of spreading the Coronavirus to outlying areas.  People are literally FIGHTING each other to get food:

People are trying virtually anything they can to ESCAPE the quarantine, to get food:

Roadblocks erected by bulldozers, bucket loaders and backhoes, consisting of large piles of dirt, rocks, and other obstructions, now appear on most roads into and out of Quarantined cities.

Some of these barriers were erected by government while others were erected by people in small towns and villages to keep the infected OUT.

In the meantime, people throughout China are still simply DROPPING DEAD in their tracks:

In Shopping Malls:

On the public streets:

All over the public street:

In other places, people are engaging in fist fights to get their hands on Filter Masks:

People in some areas are attacking others for merely COMING IN to their neighborhood; WARNING: People hit in head with PIPES:

Those who are not dropping dead, are literally fighting each other for food:

Meanwhile, the lines to just get IN to a hospital are . . . . unimaginable:

OUTSIDE CHINA, people are also dropping dead from this virus.   

In Mexico, this poor man waited far too long, until the disease became Hemorrhagic;  THIS is how this disease ends (GRAPHIC):

Things inside China are getting so bad, Police are now BOARDING-UP People inside their apartments to KEEP THEM IN!

And MORE people Nailed-in to their own homes:

And once the police leave, other people are coming and SETTING THE HOMES ON FIRE to burn the infected people to death!

CHINA ORDERS ALL PETS KILLED

Residential committees, village officials and companies from various provinces and municipalities issued a strict order to locals after receiving instructions from their superiors to tackle the epidemic, it has emerged.  They have ordered citizens to ""get rid of"" their pets or face having them culled.

One village in Hebei urged all households to 'deal with' their pets within five days, otherwise officials would 'handle' them altogether; while another residential committee in Shaanxi instructed people to 'consider the overall situation' and dispose of their cats and dogs immediately.

China says pets can carry the bio-weapon virus and spread it to others.

China is only about 30 Days into this outbreak, and their entire country and society are already collapsing.   What you see above OVER THERE, is just 30 days away from happening OVER HERE.

Are you preparing?

Bear in mind that all this is just ONE MONTH into the outbreak.  ONE MONTH!

What we see happening in China, can -- and very likely WILL -- happen here, in America.

Today (Saturday February 1) A California man has tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the seventh confirmed case in the United States.

The unidentified man is a resident of Santa Clara County, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Friday afternoon, according to local news reports.

Health officials have documented two other cases in California; two in Illinois; one in Arizona and one in Washington state.

UPDATE 4:43 PM EST -- The eighth confirmed US case of the coronavirus is in a man in his 20s who lives in Boston, according to a press release from Boston and Massachusetts health officials. The man recently returned from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak.

Yesterday, The Hal Turner Radio Show was told that Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh had a patient who tested positive for Corona Virus, who had been in the city for over a week, doing business.   The source reported that federal government people came and took the patient away, then FORCED Nurses, Doctors and Staff to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements which threatened them with criminal prosecution and prison, if they revealed anything about the existence of this patient to anyone!

Thus, the American people must now start to wonder whether other Doctors, Nurses, and health care providers are being intimidated into staying silent too?   FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS, MOST FOLKS DO NOT BELIEVE THE ""OFFICIAL"" NUMBERS REGARDING THE NUMBER OF INFECTED OR THE NUMBER OF DEATHS.

Most people who have been following this situation closely say they think we are smack dab in the middle of a global cover-up.

You don't:
- Quarantine around 65 million people (figures vary, but multiple large cities in China are involved)
- Stop people traveling on highways to check their temperatures
- Extend the Lunar New Year holiday so people don't go back to work
- Delay the start of spring semester classes
- Shut down the stock market

All because 259 people have died. The actions taken by not only China, but by dozens of other countries around the globe, are not a logical response to 259 fatalities.

The best way to avoid this is to protect yourself and your family.  Here's how:

HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF

The Medical Infrastructure of the United States (and pretty much every other country) simply CANNOT HANDLE THIS from the perspective of how many get infected and how fast that happens.  There simply are not enough hospital beds, respirators, negative-pressure infectious disease isolation rooms.   Once the virus gets here in earnest (it probably already is but we won't know for ten days) the medical system will be quickly overwhelmed. We could see Medical Infrastructure COLLAPSE here in the USA the same as it is happening in China.  

When things go wild weasel here in America, there will be all sorts of unanticipated service disruptions. 

The general public remains blissfully unaware of the utter disaster coming at us, because the mass-media is keeping rather quiet about the situation.  But when they can't keep quiet any longer, there will be PANIC.  

You should PREPARE NOW because once the SHTF, it will be too late.

Here are suggested ""Preps"" to try to get yourself and your family through what's coming.  There is precious little time left . . .

The best strategy for this is NOT to be exposed.   Fat chance of that; we ALL go out: Work, school, shopping, recreation, and so forth.

So how might we protect ourselves while we're out?

Well, the fact this virus can be spread by air, in addition to staying alive on surfaces like counter tops, desks, water fountains, door handles, inside cars and buses, product packages on store shelves that someone else handled, or sneezed-on or coughed-on,  - including ones that get delivered by mail, FedEx, UPS, etc. --  complicates things greatly.

Step One: Stay home.   Do not go out unless you absolutely MUST.

Step Two: Presuming you have to go out (we ALL do) wear a filter mask  eye and hand protective gear (below).

The N-95 filter masks are almost completely sold out already, nationwide.  So you can get a better mask rated as N-100 or P-100 for the time being until THEY sell out.  Links to various suppliers are HERE-N-95 and HERE N-100.   (I am NOT the seller)

You can also get the VASTLY AVAILABLE   3M 7500 (HERE)  which uses 3M 2091 filters  (HERE)   This mask system is more expensive, but it works and is widely still available.  (Again, I am NOT the seller)

Get Eye Protection, either cheap swimmer goggles (HERE) or better safety goggles (HERE)

Get a box of rubber/nitrile Gloves (Here)

Wear this gear when you go out.

Yes, you'll look and feel ridiculous.   But you are much more likely to have the last laugh because YOU are protecting yourself.

THIS IS URGENTLY IMPORTANT: 

The absolute moment you get home, take off your shoes and leave them in the foyer.  DO NOT WALK AROUND YOUR HOUSE IN SHOES YOU WORE OUTSIDE. 

You may have walked on a large amount of infected material as you were out and if you wear those shoes in the house, the virus will spread in the house.

Next: Go into the bathroom, take off your clothing, put it in a hamper or plastic bag, and take a shower.  You HAVE TO WASH OFF any virus that may have landed on your body or hair, while you were out.

Put on clean garments.  You cannot go sit in your chair or lay on your couch or bed in clothing you wore outside.  The virus will come off the clothing, onto the furniture and pow, someone in the house catches it.

Make every person in your household do this the absolute moment they come home.  This virus is HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS and it KILLS people.  We cannot skimp or get lazy protecting ourselves.

Eat right, take vitamins (I use Centrum), and, I don't want to sound hokey, or like some Bible thumper,  pray to Almighty God that you be protected by Him during this crisis.  I'm not kidding.  I mean it: PRAY.

Even if you haven't prayed in decades, start now.  ""Hi God, it's me (so and so).  I know I haven't prayed to you in a long time, but I'm coming back to you now.  . . . .""

And then talk honestly and earnestly to him, in a very quiet voice.

CHINA PUBLICLY DENIES THIS STORY 

Chinese experts on Sunday denied rumors that the novel #coronavirus originated from lab-grown samples. Shi Zhengli, Chinese virologist and researcher at the #Wuhan Institute of Virology, said the outbreak was due to improper lifestyle choices rather than sample leaks from a lab. pic.twitter.com/zO4q2JZEeR

— People's Daily, China (@PDChina) February 2, 2020
China is now publicly DENYING the virus outbreak was caused by a leaked virus from the Wuhan Virology lab.  Yet the proof above about them having this exact virus, and the 100% genetic envelope match, gives LIE to China's denial.   MOREOVER, that precise lab, even published a scientific paper on Combining BAT-SARS-like Virus with inserts from HIV to make it MORE INFECTIOUS.   That scientific paper is HERE for all to read.

Now, I ask you, is it more likely their Frankenstein-type Virus got out, or that some people lived lifestyles which caused the EXACT same illness?   

Sorry China, your lab lost this virus into the public and now you're trying to save face by shifting blame.  Nobody believes you."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_547409,"(Natural News) Every virology lab in the world that has run a genomic analysis of the coronavirus now knows that the coronavirus was engineered by human scientists. The proof is in the virus itself: The tools for genetic insertion are still present as remnants in the genetic code. Since these unique gene sequences don’t occur by random chance, they’re proof that this virus was engineered by scientists in a lab.

But the WHO and CDC are covering up this inconvenient fact in order to protect communist China and its biological weapons program, since no government wants the public to know the full truth about how frequently government-run labs experience outbreaks. Decades ago, for example, the U.S. Army ran an Ebola bioweapons lab in the United States, where a monkey infected one of the scientists there. The strain turned out to be infectious only in monkeys, not humans, so the world dodged a bullet, but the U.S. Army “nuked” the entire facility with chemical bombs, killing all the monkeys and wiping out any last remnant of the virus on U.S. soil.

You can read the full details of that incident in the book The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. We’ve also covered it at NaturalNews.com, where this book description is reprinted:

In 1989, Reston, VA — one of the most famous U.S. planned communities located about 10 miles from Washington DC — stood at the epicenter of a potential biological disaster. This well-known story was narrated by Richard Preston in a bone chilling account related to the recognition and containment of a devastating tropical filovirus at a monkey facility — the Reston Primate Quarantine Unit.

That outbreak occurred because Ebola was found to be spreading through the air ducts, confirming that Ebola can spread through the air. This simple fact was vigorously covered up by the entire medical establishment during the Ebola scare in the United States many years later, where the CDC transported an infected patient to a hospital in Dallas, subsequently infecting a nurse who was treated with highly toxic chemicals that caused permanent kidney damage (she later sued the hospital for the damage she suffered).

The reason this is relevant is because in order to understand the coronavirus situation in China, we must first realize that virology research labs routinely experience lapses in containment. Even the United States has failed to contain deadly viral strains when trying to study them. China’s BSL-4 labs have experienced multiple accidental releases of SARS strains, and this new coronavirus is now confirmed to be an engineered strain that was either used in bioweapons research or vaccine experiments.

The genomic coding in the virus is not natural, in other words. Just as you would never encounter a snake in the desert that’s writing a book containing words and grammatical structure, the genetic sequences now identified in the coronavirus strain are, without question, proof that human engineers have been tinkering with the strain.

How to genetically engineer viruses: the pShuttle vector
One of the tools used to accomplish this genetic engineering is called pShuttle. It’s a genetic tool set that can carry a payload of genes to be inserted into the target virus.

Researchers engaged in genetic engineering can purchase the pShuttle sequence from online retailers such as AddGenes.org, which sells the sequence for $75, shipped in “bacteria as agar stab.”



The following map outlines the complete gene sequence of the pShuttle tool:



The method for using pShuttle is described in a PubMed document entitled, “A simplified system for generating recombinant adenoviruses.”

The summary of the paper describes, “a strategy that simplifies the generation and production of such viruses.” Here’s how the process works to achieve genetic engineering of viruses:

A recombinant adenoviral plasmid is generated with a minimum of enzymatic manipulations, using homologous recombination in bacteria rather than in eukaryotic cells. After transfections of such plasmids into a mammalian packaging cell line, viral production is conveniently followed with the aid of green fluorescent protein, encoded by a gene incorporated into the viral backbone. Homogeneous viruses can be obtained from this procedure without plaque purification.



The paper describes how this approach will, “expedite the process of generating and testing recombinant adenoviruses.”



During this process, of course, the pShuttle leaves behind unique code, a “fingerprint” of the genetic modification. It is this fingerprint that has now been identified in the coronavirus.

As revealed by genomics researcher James Lyons-Weiler in this bombshell analysis article, the pShuttle genetic code is found in the coronavirus that’s circulating in the wild.

This is proof that the virus has been engineered by human scientists.

“IPAK researchers found a sequence similarity between a pShuttle-SN recombination vector sequence and INS1378,” writes Lyons-Weiler for IPAK:



Another gene sequence also shows a 92% match with the Spike protein from the SARS coronavirus:



The process for achieving this was patented by Chinese researchers as shown in this patent link.

The pShuttle vector was used to insert SARS genes into the coronavirus, a process that makes it deadly to humans. “The very researchers conducting studies on SARS vaccines have cautioned repeatedly against human trials,” warns Lyons-Weiler:

The disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered.

He also warns about, “studies that have reported serious immunopathology in animals – rats, ferrets, and monkeys – in which animals vaccinated against coronoviruses tended to have extremely high rates of respiratory failure upon subsequent exposure in the study when challenged with the wild-type coronavirus.”

He concludes:

If the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.

Another doctor from Beijing Medical University warns the virus appears to be genetically engineered
Lyons-Weiler is not alone in his assessment of the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus. Dr. Yuhong Dong, who holds a doctorate degree in infectious diseases from Beijing University, writes in The Epoch Times:

Based on recently published scientific papers, this new coronavirus has unprecedented virologic features that suggest genetic engineering may have been involved in its creation. The virus presents with severe clinical features, thus it poses a huge threat to humans. It is imperative for scientists, physicians, and people all over the world, including governments and public health authorities, to make every effort to investigate this mysterious and suspicious virus in order to elucidate its origin and to protect the ultimate future of the human race.

Dr. Yuhong reminds us that a Jan. 30 science paper published in The Lancet concludes that, “recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus.” In other words, this did not occur through natural mutations in the wild.

He also points to a Jan. 27th study by five Greek scientists who also concluded the coronavirus has no lineage to other viruses in the “family tree” that’s found in the wild. He writes:

A Jan. 27 2020, study by 5 Greek scientists analyzed the genetic relationships of 2019-nCoV and found that “the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus,” and has an unusual middle segment never seen before in any coronavirus. All this indicates that 2019-nCoV is a brand-new type of coronavirus. The study’s authors rejected the original hypothesis that 2019-nCoV originated from random natural mutations between different coronaviruses.



“No bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market”
Dr. Yuhong writes about The Lancet study by authors Roujian Lu et al., from the China Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, repeating a quote from that paper:

First, the outbreak was first reported in late December 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV.

In other words, it isn’t from bats.

That means the entire mainstream media is lying to us about the real origins of the coronavirus.

That same paper goes on to underscore the misinformation in the official explanation, stating, “Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases—27 of the first 41 in one report, 26 of 47 in another—were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful, were not. This raises the possibility that the initial jump into people happened elsewhere.”

Both Lu (in The Lancet paper linked above) and Lyons-Weiler point to the presence of a SARS binding protein sequence in the coronavirus that allows it to easily infect human cells. As explained in The Epoch Times:

…despite considerable genetics distance between the Wuhan CoV and the human-infecting SARS-CoV, and the overall low homology of the Wuhan CoV S-protein to that of SARS-CoV, the Wuhan CoV S-protein had several patches of sequences in the receptor binding (RBD) domain with a high homology to that of SARS-CoV. The residues at positions 442, 472, 479, 487, and 491 in SARS-CoV S-protein were reported to be at receptor complex interface and considered critical for cross species and human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV. So to our surprise, despite replacing four out of five important interface amino acid residues, the Wuhan CoV S-protein was found to have a significant binding affinity to human ACE2. …The Wuhan CoV S-protein and SARS-CoV S-protein shared an almost identical 3-D structure in the RBD domain, thus maintaining similar van der Waals and electrostatic properties in the interaction interface. Thus the Wuhan CoV is still able to pose a significant public health risk for human transmission via the S protein–ACE2 binding pathway. (emphasis added)

As Dr. Yuhong asks, “How could this novel virus be so intelligent as to mutate precisely at selected sites while preserving its binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor? How did the virus change just four amino acids of the S-protein? Did the virus know how to use Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) to make sure this would happen?”

It couldn’t happen by chance, in other words. The coronavirus is not a random mutation in the wild. It was engineered.

Many other scientists around the world are now investigating the gene sequences found in the coronavirus, and they are increasingly concluding that elements of the virus have been engineered.

Many of those scientists are being threatened and censored. One paper has so far been forced to be withdrawn and revised, no doubt to remove the key conclusions that point to the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus, but the proof of its engineering cannot be denied forever.

Either the coronavirus was genetically engineered, or the science establishment is going to have to throw out the entire field of genomics research and claim it isn’t real
Eventually, the science establishment is either going to have to conclude that this coronavirus strain was engineered, or that all the laws of genetics science don’t work, and gene sequencing is imaginary (sort of like transgenderism by the “progressive” Left, which has already abandoned biological reality).

So far they’ve tried to bamboozle the public into believing this is all some sort of accident from Mother Nature, but that has only worked because most of the public doesn’t understand enough science to counter the official propaganda. However, there are more than enough independent scientists around the world to prove that this pandemic strain was engineered by humans. More evidence is coming out each day.

Interestingly, as this article is going to press, all the official numbers of infections and deaths from coronavirus have been frozen for about 14 hours and counting, almost as if every nation of the world has agreed to stop reporting new numbers. This may be a temporary situation that gets resolved in the next few hours, but it’s highly suspicious. For the last week, we’ve been getting new updates about every 12 hours or sooner, and we’ve never seen the count frozen for this long.

At the same time, an 11th case of coronavirus has now been confirmed by the CDC in the United States, revealing that infections are continuing to spread in the USA, despite the efforts of the CDC to contain the outbreak."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_538494,"Today, Mitt Romney announced (IN TEARS) he will join the Democrat effort to reverse the 2016 election and remove President Trump from office.

Fortunately for President Trump and the nation, the president will not be removed from office. He will be acquitted of this fake impeachment scam and remain in power.

Unfortunately for Senator Mitt Romney, he may not be as lucky. Utah Republicans are preparing legislation to recall and remove sitting U.S. Senators.

If this becomes law, Romney could be the one removed from office.

READ THE FULL STORY:

As Mitt Romney grandstands in the U.S Senate’s doomed Trump impeachment trial in an effort to demonstrate his own moral superiority, the Utah legislature is mulling a measure that would allow the state’s citizens to recall their senators.

The measure could hypothetically be used to recall Romney from office. Such a possibility is an acute irony, considering Romney appears to be the only Republican senator enthusiastic about impeaching President Donald Trump.

Rep. Tim Quinn of Heber City introduced the bill in the state house. Utah doesn’t currently have a process to recall sitting U.S Senators, a problem his legislation would solve.

He says the bill isn’t designed with any specific Senator in mind, but it’s hard not to imagine the measure being used to impeach Romney, considering the Never Trump senator’s extreme unpopularity in his own state.

HB217 would create a system in which Utah voters could set up a recall election to remove senators. 25% of active voters in the state would have to sign a petition requesting a recall vote, which would take place during the next scheduled election. Senators are immune from the prospect of a recall election within a year of their initial term.

Considering that almost half of Utah Republicans don’t approve of Romney’s representation in the Senate, it’s more than reasonable to imagine a quarter of the state’s population voting to remove the failed presidential candidate, whose connection to Utah has always been dubious.

The notion of recalling a federal legislator is a constitutionally vague concept. Some states have processes in place that allow members of congress to be recalled by voters, but a senator has never been actually recalled and the Supreme Court has never ruled if such a process to remove sitting members of congress would be legal.

However, facing a recall process would be an acute embarrassment for Senator Romney, who seems to have fully devoted his senatorial duties to focusing on impeachment and faux moral outrage to other purported Trump “scandals.”"

PAVEL DARYL KEM SENOU, A CAMEROONIAN STUDENT IN CHINA “BECAME THE FIRST AFRICAN PERSON KNOWN TO BE INFECTED WITH THE DEADLY CORONAVIRUS AND THE FIRST TO RECOVER.” 
Some sources are claiming that Black and brown people resists the coronavirus because of superior genetics. Is there truth to this?
This claim started because the first African to be infected with the Coronavirus, Pavel Daryl Kem Senou, responded well to medical treatment, unlike thousands of others (non-africans) who contracted the virus and died soon after.
One of the first Cameroonian general information websites reports, Journalducameroun.com reports, “The Chinese Embassy in Yaounde has announced that after receiving medical treatment, Pavel Daryl Kem Senou, Cameroonian student residing in China, recently infected with the Coronavirus pandemic is faring well.“
DOES THIS MEAN AFRICANS SKIN CAN RESIST THE CORONAVIRUS?
The benefits of melanin (internal and external) must be considered when talking about black people resisting the coronavirus. Sure that young Cameroonian student received medical treatment which obviously aided in the recovery, but did his high levels of melanin help him avoid death?
A study done by The National Center of Biological Health shows that melanin levels in an organism may affect the ability to resist disease and viruses.
“Once exposed to parasites, individuals often vary in their physiological ability to resist the infection either by killing or removing parasites. Melanin-based coloration could have several influences here.” 
The report goes on to say, ” melanin is tightly linked to the immune system, for instance, through pleiotropic effects of melanocortins that can bind to various receptors in the skin and in the immune cells. This could enable differently coloured individuals to mount different immune responses and limit parasite proliferation.“
So although Africans and other black people may not be 100% resistant to the virus, melanin levels do play a significant factor in why Africans and other black people who have been exposed to the virus have not become infected or dead at least not at the same rate of people with lower levels of melanin.
WHAT IS THE CORONAVIRUS?
According to the World Health Organization (who.com), “Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses found in both animals and humans. Some infect people and are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).“"

Are they running behind schedule? This was supposed to happen by 2017 in the United States:

One thing is for sure, the elites do NOT want Donald J. Trump to be president. He has already stealthy began cutting the budget for the UN by 50%:

As expected, establishment mouthpiece Foreign Affairs is horrified by the despicable plan of President Trump to slash the subsidy to the UN by 50 percent.

State Department staffers have been instructed to seek cuts in excess of 50 percent in U.S. funding for U.N. programs, signaling an unprecedented retreat by President Donald Trump’s administration from international operations that keep the peace, provide vaccines for children, monitor rogue nuclear weapons programs, and promote peace talks from Syria to Yemen, according to three sources.

The push for such draconian measures comes as the White House is scheduled on Thursday to release its 2018 budget proposal, which is expected to include cuts of up to 37 percent for spending on the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other foreign assistance programs, including the U.N., in next year’s budget. The United States spends about $10 billion a year on the United Nations.

Okay, Foreign Affairs, we’ll tell you what. How about we end our support of the UN and dedicate some of that $10 billion per year that is wasted on the useless UN, and put it toward private organizations that provide health care including vaccines for children? That is if helping children by improving their health is the real goal, not maintaining a bloated international bureaucracy that wastes money and hates the US.

h1n1 was a big deal, but Obama didn’t know what the hell he was doing

In April of 2009, the H1N1 became a pandemic.

But it wasn’t until six months later, October, that then-President Obama declared a public health emergency on what was already a pandemic. By that time, the disease had infected millions of Americans and more than 1,000 people had died in the U.S.

CNN reported at the time:

Since the H1N1 flu pandemic began in April, millions of people in the United States have been infected, at least 20,000 have been hospitalized and more than 1,000 have died, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [emphasis added]

Furthermore, the CDC’s Frieden fretted at the time that efforts to create a vaccine had stumbled:

“We are nowhere near where we thought we would be,” Frieden said, acknowledging that manufacturing delays have contributed to less vaccine being available than expected. “As public health professionals, vaccination is our strongest tool. Not having enough is frustrating to all of us.”

Frieden said that while the way vaccine is manufactured is “tried and true,” it’s not well-suited for ramping up production during a pandemic because it takes at least six months. The vaccine is produced by growing weakened virus in eggs."

The letter, obtained by Your Content, is dated March 1, 2020 and confirms the hospital is now on red alert following a CDC notification that a patient has tested positive in their building.

According to a source who was briefed on the entire situation, a total at least three but possibly as many as 8 individuals have been exposed. However, that figure does not include individuals that might’ve contracted the virus prior to the patient’s initial arrival, the source says.

“We’ve been asked to stay silent on the issue until the CDC has time to assess the damages,” the source said, speaking only under the condition of anonymity.

“I could confirm there are at least three individuals being placed under extreme care — one remains in isolation and has tested positive for the coronavirus.”

The source noted they are awaiting the results from approximately 8 tests that were subsequently sent out after the patient tested positive.

“Doctors Hospital of Sarosota has been notified by the Centers for Disease Control that we have a patient in our facility who presumptively tested positive for COVID-19,” the release reads. “This patient was admitted to our facility in late February, and remains in our care. On Friday, Feb. 28th, the CDC changed its guidance regarding COVID-19, specifically, the criteria for persons under investigation (PUI), which consequently activated all protocols for handling potential COVID-19 cases, including immediate isolation.”

“All potentially exposed individuals have been identified. We are working very closely with the local and state departments of health as well as the CDC to assure that we continue to take all appropriate precautions,” the release goes on to say.

“Just as we have done with seasonal flu and tuberculosis, we identify and treat infectious diseases while minimizing risk. By being aware of the very latest recommendations of the CDC, Doctors Hospital of Sarosota was able to identify this patient and pursue testing at the very earliest opportunity.”

“Please know that the safety of our patients, colleagues and community is of the utmost concern,” the release declares.

The recent widespread outbreak of the respiratory disease stemmed from a novel coronavirus that was first detected in China and which has now been detected in 60 locations internationally, including in the United States.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.

During the week of February 23, CDC reported community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in California (in two places), Oregon and Washington. Community spread in Washington resulted in the first death in the United States from COVID-19, as well as the first reported case of COVID-19 in a health care worker, and the first potential outbreak in a long-term care facility.

The CDC affirms that there are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.

HOW WILL THE CORONAVIRUS IMPACT MY COMMUNITY?
More cases of the coronavirus are likely to be identified in the coming days, according to the CDC. That includes a rapid increase in cases in the United States. It’s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in communities in the United States. It’s likely that at some point, widespread transmission of the coronavirus in the United States will occur.

Widespread transmission of the coronavirus would translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, workplaces, and other places for mass gatherings may experience more absenteeism. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to protect against the coronavirus and no medications approved to treat it. Nonpharmaceutical interventions would be the most important response strategy.

5G Syndrome Maps Perfectly with Coronavirus Outbreaks

There’s a LOT of hard evidence now emerging the further away we get from the original crime scene in Wuhan, China and as the coronavirus pops up around the world in 5G Hotspots that indicates this pandemic is being manufactured for multiple reasons.

As it turns out, those nations with the most advanced 5G roll-outs have the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases, both infection rates and death rates.

In those countries that have permitted IoT build-outs where the 5G power grids are the most developed, the coronavirus infection rate is taking off.

What’s really interesting is that Africa has thus far shown very few cases. As of this weekend there were only 3 medically acknowledged cases on the entire continent. Which begs the question: How do the Third World countries in Africa avoid such a contagious strain of the coronavirus given the pervasive lack of proper sanitation and necessary hygiene?

In light of how deeply involved the Chinese are with development projects all over Africa, it’s quite curious how that infection number is still so low. Perhaps it’s directly related to the absence of 5G roll-outs in the vast majority of African nations.

Before those nations suffering the greatest number of coronavirus infections to date are further investigated — China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Germany, United States, France, Spain, Kuwait — another curious development ought to be looked at closely.

The Proof is in the Cruise Ships

The single best proof of the quite obvious 5G-Coronavirus linkage are the various cruise ships that have seen an inexplicable mushrooming of coronavirus cases, even after all the passengers were quarantined.

Many of the biggest cruise lines now advertise the fact that they have the latest and greatest 5G technologies in place. The most advanced cruise ships actually possess the best examples of what the Internet of Things (IoT) will look like in the future … if the build-outs proceed unimpeded by the very serious health concerns and safety issues.

KEY POINT: Cruise-goers, by and large, love to stay connected with the folks back home. They especially enjoy texting their many photos-by-smartphone back to family and friends. Businessmen have a need to stay in touch with the office as other passengers want to stay abreast of all the breaking news in 2020. Hence, every cruise ship will eventually become a 5G–IoT paradise if they’re not already.

What really happened on the quarantined cruise ships is that those folks were likely quite vulnerable to the flu bug for a variety of reasons. Then, when they entered the fully operational 5G space* on the ships, their immunity was profoundly weakened so that they would be susceptible any influenza strain, including the Wuhan coronavirus—COVID-19.

*The cruise lines have literally put their 5G technology on super-steroids as seen in this promotion: MedallionNet™: The Best Wi-Fi at Sea.

5G Nations

It has also been astutely observed that those nations with the most pervasive and powerful 5G networks fully functioning are those that have suffered the biggest outbreaks of the coronavirus to date. Why should anyone be surprised at this wholly predictable outcome?

The following excerpt comes from: CORONAVIRUS BOMBSHELL: This proves it should be named “5G COVID-19”

The importance of viewing the coronavirus COVID-19 as a “Telephone Disease” is that by doing so it explains some perplexing mysteries about the spread of this disease—such as why this disease has struck the Gulf nations and monarchies in the Persian Gulf region, but becomes explainable when one notices their ongoing 5G revolution—most particularly in Iran, where this country is completely blanketed to its smallest village with 4G technology coverage—but who are now putting the finishing touches on rolling out 5G technology throughout their entire nation in the coming weeks—finishing touches that included Iran activating their Chinese bought 5G technology for testing—that was immediately met by Iran having more coronavirus cases and deaths of any nation outside of China—and whose Vice President is one of seven of their top government officials now infected.

Coronavirus COVID-19 disease outbreak begins to spread in Persian Gulf nations and monarchies activating 5G technology.

Both 5G Demonstration Zones such as Wuhan, China and floating 5G cruise liners are correctly considered 5G Hotspots. These 5G Hotspots, for the uninitiated, are really KILL ZONES because many folks will die early the longer they bask in those dangerously high levels of 5G radio-frequencies and microwave radiation.

The following excerpt from a previous exposé provides critical links for every individual who lives, works and/or plays in a 5G Super-Hotspots.

Which brings us to the single most perilous aspect of the military deployment of 5G—KILL ZONES.

All the scientific evidence available in the public domain now indicates that wherever 5G infrastructure is located in the greatest concentration generating the most powerful EMFs and microwaves, those 5G Super-Hotspots will effectively function as kill zones. As follows:

5G Super-Hotspots: You better know where the “kill zones” are located!

In order to fully grasp the highly destructive and deadly potential of these rapidly emerging 5G Super-Hotspots, the following video exposé presents a scenario where the most powerful “directed energy weapons” will be located within these 5G kill zones.

Which bring us to the primary purpose of this article—5G Syndrome.

5G Syndrome

5G Syndrome is a relatively new disease that has yet to go mainstream because of how its official recognition would immediately terminate the ongoing 5G roll-out.

Exactly what are the symptoms of 5G Syndrome?

There are many, and they manifest differently in each victim of this insidious disease.

Of course, a good number of typical flu symptoms mimic 5G Syndrome.

But what’s most important is that these two illnesses — Influenza and 5G Syndrome — will mutually sustain each other. In that way, it can be quite confusing to accurately tease out which symptoms are associated with which disease.

In other words, if you have the flu, your exposure to 5G will make it much worse. Likewise, if you have a case of full-blown 5G Syndrome, you will be much more susceptible to getting the flu, and if you do, it will be significantly worse.

Back to the primary symptoms. The best medical reference that we have at this point, since 5G Syndrome is still a relatively new medical phenomenon, is another disease known variously EMF Hypersensitivity Illness and Electrohypersensitivity (EHS).

What follows are just a few of the most common symptoms that are frequently experienced by people who know they have EHS. (Also, see the preceding diagram.)

Nausea, headaches and migraines
Ringing in the ears
Numbness in the face or other body parts
Dry eyes and sight problems
Inability to concentrate and unexplained fatigue
Depression
Tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmia
Hyperactivity and insomnia
Redness and rashes
Dryness in the throat and mouth
Swollen sinuses and symptoms rhinitis
(Source: Electrohypersensitivity: What you need to know about the allergy of the 21st century)
There are several other symptoms that are also being recognized as the direct result of intensive EMF and microwave exposures. As follows:

Headaches, migraines
Chronic exhaustion
Inner agitation
Sleeplessness, daytime sleepiness
Tinnitus
Susceptibility to infection
Nervous and connective tissue pains, for which the usual causes do not explain even the most conspicuous symptoms.
(Source: Electrohypersensitivity: What you need to know about the allergy of the 21st century)
KEY POINT: It’s essential to correctly comprehend the difference between 5G Syndrome and 5G flu.  While there are several similarities, it’s the differences that really matter.  Hence, every smartphone user and IoT enthusiast is compelled to contemplate any new health conditions or unusual symptoms or inexplicable sickness, particularly those that have been chronic and/or long term. See: CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL REPORT: Worldwide Outbreaks of 5G Syndrome and 5G Flu Driving Pandemic

Conclusion

The Wuhan coronavirus pandemic has awakened many to the reality of 5G Syndrome.

Perhaps it took all of humanity to get freaked out by a scary frankenvirus — COVID-19 — in order to wake up to this extreme and growing danger in our midst—5G technology and the slowly emerging IoT.

With this crucial understanding, at least now we know what we’re really dealing with. So, the best thing informed people can do is pass the word around: It’s really 5G and your smartphone that is causing the current pandemic, not necessarily the coronavirus or even any of the many other flu bugs circulating around the planet in 2020.

Now many folks will naturally get a bad case of one of the many types of influenzas, or even the coronavirus itself, and they will need to take that illness/disease very seriously. If they are elderly or infirm or suffer from other illnesses, they especially need to follow the best advice out there.  For the sake of prevention, there is this sage advice: Here’s How Everyone Can Avoid Getting The Coronavirus.

For other alternative treatments and holistic approaches, excellent guidance such as this can be followed: Natural Protection Strategy Against Viruses, Including the Coronavirus

Lastly, it’s important to note that the 5G Syndrome angle presented here is only one of several perspectives concerning what is really an ongoing series of bioterrorist attacks being carried out in 5G-intensive zones. The perpetrators are continuing the bio-attacks wherever they must cover up an epidemic of 5G syndrome so that the worldwide military deployment of 5G is not jeopardized by disclosures about the extremely serious health dangers and safety hazards.

Do you see how they do it?!

The NWO globalists are very clever, aren’t they?

Author’s Note

This “CORONAVIRUS HOAX” does not mean there is not a highly contagious bioengineered coronavirus that is being released as a bioweapon in the nations that have experienced the ongoing bioterrorists attacks. It means that these stealthy bio-attacks were meant to cover up the raging epidemics of 5G Syndrome in those specific locations. So, the coronavirus is quite real just as SARS and MERS, Bird Flu and Swine Flu were real. But, the Wuhan coronavirus was specifically bioengineered in order to create and hype a global pandemic around COVID-19. Again, the hoax aspect does not refer to a non-existent coronavirus; that frankenvirus is quite real indeed and being cunningly used as a decoy.

The pontiff was down with a heavy cold during his visit to Italy which made him cancel his lent retreat.
The first results for Covid-19 came back negative, and second came positive, according to Italian newspaper Il Messaggero this morning.
The Roman Catholic leader, 83, who had part of one lung removed because of an illness decades ago, also cancelled most audiences last week.
Francis was to have taken part in the week-long retreat with senior Vatican officials that began on Sunday night at a Church residence south of Rome.

But in a surprise announcement hours earlier, he said he would be following it from his residence in a Vatican guest house.
He told thousands who gathered for his weekly appearance from a window high above St Peter’s Square, in the Vatican City, on Sunday that he would not be able to attend due to a cold.
Francis asked for prayers for the Lenten retreat, adding: ‘Unfortunately, a cold prevents me from participating this year… I will be following the meditation from here’.
He has been taken ill at a time when Italy is battling a surging outbreak of the potentially deadly coronavirus.
The death toll in Italy jumped to 52 on Monday from 34 the day before and the total number of confirmed cases in Europe’s worst affected country climbed past the 2,000 mark."

The incident occurred in Flushing Queens, an area of the city filled with Chinese immigrants.
According to reports, a man was walking down the street, when he was suddenly overcome with a bought of coughing. He collapsed onto the floor, and after a few seconds, he stopped moving.
As the video shows, officers quickly arrived on the scene, but seemed unwilling to physically assist the man, perhaps out of fear.

Nancy Pelosi has a long history of promoting abortion and her first act after becoming Speaker in 2019 was pushing legislation to use tax money for abortions. So it’s no surprise she is trying to exploit the Coronavirus pandemic to push abortion funding again.
As The Daily Caller reports:
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to include a potential way to guarantee federal funding for abortion into the coronavirus economic stimulus plan, according to multiple senior White House officials.
Speaking to the Daily Caller, those officials alleged that while negotiating the stimulus with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Pelosi tried to lobby for “several” provisions that stalled bipartisan commitment to the effort. One was a mandate for up to $1 billion to reimburse laboratory claims, which White House officials say would set a precedent of health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment.
LifeNews depends on the support of readers like you to combat the pro-abortion media. Please donate now.
“A New mandatory funding stream that does not have Hyde protections would be unprecedented,” one White House official explained. “Under the guise of protecting people, Speaker Pelosi is working to make sure taxpayer dollars are spent covering abortion—which is not only backwards, but goes against historical norms.”
A second White House official referred to the provision as a “slush fund” and yet another questioned “what the Hyde Amendment and abortion have to do with protecting Americans from coronavirus?”
Americans should insist to their members of Congress that we need a clean bill that provides aggressive action to help patients and spur the economy. Killing babies with our tax dollars is not the answer to the coronavirus and the situation should not be exploited for political gain."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_514498,"An asteroid which is big enough to end civilisation should it ever hit will make a close approach to our planet in April, NASA's asteroid trackers have found. The asteroid is listed by NASA’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies' (CNEOS) in California, US. The asteroid has been officially called 52768 (1998 OR2) and is estimated measure up 2.5 miles (4.1km) across.

An object this big could potentially kill millions of people if it ever hit the planet in the distant future.

Although the asteroid in question, 52768 (1998 OR2), has been deemed safe by NASA there are cosmic processes that could influence an asteroid to change its trajectory onto an Earth-bound one.

NASA has dubbed asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) “potentially hazardous”, which describes the small possibility of an Earth-bound collision at a later, unspecified date.

According to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California: “A relatively small number of near-Earth objects pass close enough to Earth and are large enough in size to warrant close observation.

“That's because the gravitational tug of the planets could, over time, cause an object's orbital path to evolve into an Earth-crossing orbit. This allows for the possibility of a future collision.”

The findings are supported by Dr Bruce Betts of The Planetary Society who said, however unlikely, asteroids can be shifted from their path by the gravitational effects of planets and other bodies in the solar system.

Dr Betts said: “The effects of Mars’ gravity and Jupiter’s gravity can actually dislodge some asteroids from the inner asteroid belt and that is where we think most near Earth asteroids come from.”

Another process by which an asteroid can change paths is known as the Yarkovsky effect and is caused by an asteroid in direct sunlight heating and cooling down to release radiation from its surface.

Asteroid: NASA is tracking the movement of a 4.1km space rock (Image: GETTY)

NASA said: “This radiation exerts a force on the asteroid, acting as a sort of mini-thruster that can slowly change the asteroid's direction over time.”

There is also a third scenario by which an asteroid could be hit by another object and break into smaller chunks, sending them towards Earth.

Although astronomers have never directly observed such a hit, there is some evidence to suggest the asteroid that struck Earth about 65 million was the result of such a collision.

According to astronomer Deborah Byrd, founder EarthSky, the so-called Chicxulub meteor could have been created by asteroids colliding some 100 million years ago.

She said: “One fragment of that ancient smashup might have struck Earth 65 million years ago, triggering a mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs, according to astronomers.”

But the likelihood of any of these scenarios unfolding in the foreseeable future is extremely low and once astronomers determine a rock's trajectory it is unlikely to change.

NASA said of potential risks: ""As more and more observations are used to further improve an object's orbit, we become more and more confident in our knowledge of where the object will be in the future.""

As the space agency points out, no human is known to have died from a cosmic impact in the last 1,000 years.

NASA said: “It's likely that we could identify a threatening near-Earth object large enough to potentially cause catastrophic changes in the Earth's environment, and most astronomers believe that a systematic approach to studying asteroids and comets that pass close to the Earth makes good sense.

“It's too late for the dinosaurs, but today astronomers are conducting ever-increasing searches to identify all of the larger objects which pose an impact danger to Earth.”

NASA estimates the rock is travelling at speeds of about 8.7km per second or 19,461mph (31,320kmh).

At this rate, the asteroid will make a close approach to Earth on April 29.

When this happens, NASA said the asteroid will make a “close approach” to our planet.

According to the Planetary Society, an asteroid bigger than 0.6 miles (1km) across is big enough to threaten global destruction.

Astronomers estimate such objects have a one in 50,000 chance of hitting Earth every 100 years.

The Planetary Society lists the following impacts: “A crater of 10km or more: global devastation and possible collapse of civilisation.”

Asteroid facts: What is a close approach? (Image: EXPRESS/GETTY)

Dr Bruce Betts from the international group of astronomers said: “Small asteroids – few metres – hit frequently and burn up in the atmosphere and do little damage.

“Chelyabinsk size asteroids – about 20m that hit in 2013 – create shock waves that shatter windows and cause injuries.

“Tunguska sized – about 40m that hit Siberia in 1908 – could completely destroy a city or create a tsunami.

“Larger asteroids that hit on average less often could cause regional destruction.

“Even larger asteroids that hit even less frequently could cause a global catastrophe.”

The destructive potential of space rocks this big was also outlined in a 2018 report published by the US National Science and Technology Council.

The National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy reads: “Objects close to and larger than one kilometre can cause damage on a global scale.

“They can trigger earthquakes, tsunamis, and other secondary effects that extend far beyond the immediate impact area.”

For comparison, the asteroid that is believed to have killed the dinosaurs measured about six miles (10km) across.

NASA estimates Asteroid 1998 OR2 measures somewhere between 0.9 miles and 2.54 miles (1.5km and 4.1km) in diameter.

The space rock was spotted flying around the Sun in 1987 and NASA confirmed it’s orbit on June 30, 1987.

Astronomers have classed the rock as a “potentially hazardous” NEO or near-Earth object.

But just how close does NASA expect the asteroid to come to Earth next month?

At its closest, the space rock will approach our planet from about 0.04205 astronomical units.

One astronomical unit is the average distance from our planet to the Sun – about 93 million miles (149.6 million km).

Asteroid OR2 will drastically cut this down to just 3.9 million miles (6.29 million km) on April 29.

In other words, the space rock is expected to miss us by about 16.36 times the distance from Earth to the Moon.

Dr Betts said: “There are a few asteroids that currently are known to have a low probability of hitting Earth in tens to hundreds of years.

“For example, one of the highest probabilities currently is an approximately 37m diameter asteroid called 2000 SG344 that has a 1 in 1100 chance of impact in 2071.

“But these always are based on asteroid observations that have uncertainties in them.”"

After 9/11, for example, Americans accepted the near-total destruction of their civil liberties in the PATRIOT Act’s hollow promises of security.

It is ironic to see the same Democrats who tried to impeach President Trump last month for abuse of power demanding that the Administration grab more power and authority in the name of fighting a virus that thus far has killed less than 100 Americans.

Declaring a pandemic emergency on Friday, President Trump now claims the power to quarantine individuals suspected of being infected by the virus and, as Politico writes, “stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease.” He can even call out the military to cordon off a US city or state.

State and local authoritarians love panic as well. The mayor of Champaign, Illinois, signed an executive order declaring the power to ban the sale of guns and alcohol and cut off gas, water, or electricity to any citizen. The governor of Ohio just essentially closed his entire state.

The chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration is without a doubt Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Fauci is all over the media, serving up outright falsehoods to stir up even more panic. He testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is ten times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis.

On Face the Nation, Fauci did his best to further damage an already tanking economy by stating, “Right now, personally, myself, I wouldn’t go to a restaurant.” He has pushed for closing the entire country down for 14 days.

Over what? A virus that has thus far killed just over 5,000 worldwide and less than 100 in the United States? By contrast, tuberculosis, an old disease not much discussed these days, killed nearly 1.6 million people in 2017. Where’s the panic over this?

If anything, what people like Fauci and the other fearmongers are demanding will likely make the disease worse. The martial law they dream about will leave people hunkered down inside their homes instead of going outdoors or to the beach where the sunshine and fresh air would help boost immunity. The panic produced by these fearmongers is likely helping spread the disease, as massive crowds rush into Walmart and Costco for that last roll of toilet paper.

The madness over the coronavirus is not limited to politicians and the medical community. The head of the neoconservative Atlantic Council wrote an editorial this week urging NATO to pass an Article 5 declaration of war against the COVID-19 virus! Are they going to send in tanks and drones to wipe out these microscopic enemies?

People should ask themselves whether this coronavirus “pandemic” could be a big hoax, with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated by those who seek to profit – financially or politically – from the ensuing panic.

That is not to say the disease is harmless. Without question people will die from coronavirus. Those in vulnerable categories should take precautions to limit their risk of exposure. But we have seen this movie before. Government over-hypes a threat as an excuse to grab more of our freedoms. When the “threat” is over, however, they never give us our freedoms back."

For Gates, “vaccines” seem to be his solution for the greatest problem – in his view – that exists…people. As you can see in the video below, Gates lauds vaccines as a way to limit the human population.

  

Notice that after claiming the Earth must see a zero CO2 impact from humanity by limiting “services” to zero, Gates claims that part of his depopulation goal is vaccines.

How would vaccines lead to depopulation, when they’re ostensibly designed to make people healthy? Well, Gates is spending a whopping sum on contraception, abortion, and sterilization in Third World countries, but there’s a little secret about his vaccines as well.

Bill Gates’ vaccines have made news reports in recent days for (supposedly inadvertently) containing sterilization meds. Who would have thought? Gates and his world-depopulation taskforce basically said “oopsie” and moved ahead. Facebook’s fact-checker, Africa Check, claims the stories are bogus but, quite frankly, Africa Check said our article about the LGBT demanding to be treated as a priority for coronavirus was bogus, and they only took issue with our use of scare quotes around the word “transgender.” So honestly, we don’t believe them. Facebook’s owner, Mark Zuckerberg, is partnering with Gates in his vaccine agenda, so their in-house “fact-checker” is hardly impartial.

And now, Gates is leading the fight (he’s a computer guy, right?) to find a coronavirus vaccine. And Gates now argues that “mass gatherings” (churches) will not meet again until a vaccine is found and everyone is vaccinated.

The press reports Gates said, “What does opening up look like? Which activities, like schools, can be done in a way that the risk of transmission is very low? And which activities, like mass gatherings, maybe — in a certain sense — more optional? Until you’re widely vaccinated, those may not come back at all.”

Gates has suggested a “digital tracking program” be put in place to designate people as immune to coronavirus or infected, a program of immense implications for personal liberty and privacy. Attorney General William Barr said he was “very concerned” about personal liberties by the suggestion."

Michigan Governor Deems Gardening Supplies — Including Fruit And Vegetable Seeds — ‘Non-Essential’
By: Virginia Kruta

Michigan Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s latest executive order deems a number of home-improvement and gardening items — including fruit and vegetable seeds — “non-essential.”

In addition to enforcing social distancing measures and limiting the number of people in the stores that were allowed to remain open — in order to slow the spread of coronavirus — Whitmer’s April 9 order also gave explicit instructions with regard to items that could not be sold as they were considered “non-essential.”
The restriction on gardening supplies struck a nerve, which came just as the weather was beginning to warm to the proper temperatures for most early planting.

I didn't believe this at first, but Whitmer's order does indeed require stores to shut down their gardening and planting sections. https://t.co/aV7AOigtQp

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_329260,"As a state representative, I have had a front-row seat for Missouri’s response to the coronavirus threat. We made significant preparations to cope with the influx of patients and said our prayers that social distancing and the shelter in place orders would “flatten the curve” sufficiently to save lives and save us from the worst-case scenario nightmare predictions of millions dead nationwide. It has been greatly encouraging to hear from our governor and public health officials on a daily basis that we have mobilized vast resources, provided millions of dollars for equipment that our health care providers and first responders need to keep them safe while they tend to our sick, cut through red tape to make sure that intended recipients get what they should in record time, made sure that our food supply is safe, and have taken common-sense precautions to keep the “curve” as flat as a molehill when compared to the mountains experienced in other countries. Thankfully, we have seen success to date, as nearly half of our counties have not reported positive cases.

It is also gratifying to see the private and nonprofit sectors do what they always do — help in as many ways as possible as quickly as possible to help those in need, starting with distributing food and assisting businesses with the application process to access government resources without further delay. The U.S. has never shut its economy down before on such a scale on purpose. We are in uncharted waters, and it has been gratifying to see how many Americans have risen to the challenge selflessly, starting with our health care workers and first responders, our schools, and our businesses that are enduring hardships unimaginable six months ago.


State Rep. Louis Riggs
On the other hand, I have seen the worst, starting with the morons in neighboring states who stockpiled hand sanitizers to sell at radically marked up prices online, raids on toilet paper based on some manner of wisdom that has so far escaped me, and the most galling of all, panic selling by allegedly intelligent financial wizards who manage to detonate trillions of dollars in market value on a daily basis because their quarterly numbers are not going so well — despite the undisputed knowledge that “this too shall pass.” If this lunacy continues, our retirement accounts will need another 10 years of contributions before we can comfortably leave the workforce. I have also spent more time than I would like knocking down nasty rumors that would only make a bad situation worse and plowing through red tape and Catch-22s that have still managed to survive.

Another troubling development: We have been inundated with breathless, non-stop reporting about the numbers who have contracted the virus and those who have died here and worldwide, dutifully updated faster than the financial news updates stock prices.

On the other side of that equation, context is sorely lacking: Nowhere near equal time has been given to the stories of those who have contracted the virus and lived through it, which is in fact the vast majority of those who have been sickened. We have had celebrities sickened by the virus — Tom Hanks and Boris Johnson come to mind immediately. Both survived and are on the mend. The folks in the mass media have been inexplicably restrained about dispensing hope by sharing the good news that the U.S. has a remarkably low death rate per thousand of confirmed cases — which is even less than advertised since there are probably millions among us who have had the virus, thought it was something else, and came through unharmed. I will not hold my breath that the mass media will change its tactics any time soon.

As a state representative, I also have to think ahead to the lessons to be learned from this pandemic and how to best apply them at both the policy and appropriations levels. These are a few of the items I am contemplating at the moment.

First, how do we — if possible — stop or severely curtail the damage to our people physically and economically as a result of viruses that sweep the globe with alarming regularity? Since China appears to be the world’s leading petri dish for brewing viruses that kill animals as well as humans and reportedly facilitates the jump of viruses from animals to humans through the ingestion of such critters as bats and pangolins available through so-called “wet markets,” do we need to permanently medically screen all travelers from China before we allow them to disembark from planes or ships when we know that this virus has as long as a two-week fuse? We wait in long lines at airports now for the TSA to make sure that all of us are not terrorists. The coronavirus has killed a lot more people than terrorists and shaved trillions off our economy, damage that terrorists can only dream of.

For added context, anyone who believes that China is our “friend” has ignored that it is a totalitarian state that has lied through its collectivist teeth about the origins of this virus and fanned on the opportunity to contain it locally in Wuhan, has “relocated” at least 1 million Uighurs into “re-education” camps to cure them of their religious beliefs, has engaged in industrial espionage (and outright intellectual property theft) on a scale never seen before in human history, has invested trillions in infrastructure to control the economic destiny of Asia, all while instituting a “social credit system” designed to enforce domestic “conformity” of more than 1 billion people using Orwellian facial recognition technology to do so (or else). Khruschev told the West he would “bury” us and took off his shoe and banged it on a table at the U.N. to get our attention; China’s President for Life, i.e., Dictator, Xi, has spared us the histrionics and has instead put our trade deficit money to work to bury us quietly, slowly and surely.

Before the dawn of the 20th century, American policy going back to John Hay’s Open Door Notes nearly 125 years ago was predicated on the notion that Chinese consumers would purchase American products in vast quantities and make us rich as a result. The exact opposite has happened. Missouri alone now imports more than $4 billion in goods from China. That represents 20 percent of all the imports in Missouri. China, in turn, buys $700 million of our goods, for a trade deficit in Missouri alone of more than $3.2 billion. We have seen the folly of chasing after the lowest possible price over the last 30 years: The result has been the hollowing out of our manufacturing sector, which devastated the Midwest. We have plenty of empty buildings to show you in Hannibal that are monuments to short-sighted trade policies that gave away our manufacturing birthright.

Our farmers are also feeling the pain of the unpredictability of Chinese markets. At least 25 percent of Chinese hogs have been killed by the latest outbreak of swine flu — probably twice that, considering that China is not renowned for telling the truth about bad news (see coronavirus bald-faced lies above). Those hogs will take years to replace; meanwhile, the soybeans they consumed as feedstocks will not be headed to China any time soon. We literally cannot afford to wait for them to repopulate their swine herds. Charity begins at home. And so does sustained prosperity.

Second, the damage to our economy due to supply chain interruptions from around the globe — primarily China and Japan, but also including Europe — must be examined. Just-in-time delivery is the cornerstone of lean manufacturing, but global disruptions such as this are yet another reminder that globalization is fine and dandy when it works, but craters national economies when it does not. We reroute commerce across Missouri and the Midwest when we are confronted with floods, but this is something different altogether — global supply chains rely on products that begin their transit oceans away, not from neighboring states. The more we make in America, the less we have to rely on products coming in from overseas. And will someone explain the rationale for outsourcing so much of our prescription drug production to China? What corporate geniuses decided that would be in our best interest as a nation? What happens when that supply chain “breaks,” or China decides to sell prescription meds to others? We should be smart enough to never find out that answer, starting today.

Third: When will we start treating broadband internet as infrastructure, every bit as critical to our daily lives as roads, bridges, and electricity? Millions of Americans have been instructed to work from home as a result of this pandemic, and corporations will be evaluating the effectiveness of that approach to their bottom lines. Many of us anticipate that the expedient will become the norm since remote workers cut down on overhead expenses. Working remotely is fine and good if you have the internet capability to do so, but nearly 1 million Missourians in rural areas do not.  The same goes for the expanded access to telemedicine announced at the federal level — great for those who have it, irrelevant for those who do not. Imagine how many fewer cases of the flu we would deal with on an annual basis if patients could be diagnosed and treated from home and not have to share their sickness with the general public in the first place. Millions of American students are being told to log on to their portals for online instruction while their schools are closed, but that is not an option for far too many of Missouri’s rural school students — an estimated 20,000 Missouri high school seniors alone this year have no such access at the most critical moment of the year: just before graduation. Virtual education is there in statute and with us in spirit, but does not happen for students who live outside of town.

Finally, we have seen multiple excesses regarding the most routine of civil rights: a governor who has forbidden planting vegetables in family gardens and a mayor taking license plate numbers at drive-in church services like the FBI at a mob boss funeral are two of the most disturbing examples. If there is a “second round” of this virus in the fall and there is no vaccine available for all of us, we are going to have to make hard choices about how far is too far.

Hopefully sooner rather than later, we will take a hard look at the lessons learned from how we handled our response to the coronavirus at the beginning of the 21st century’s “Roaring Twenties.” My prayer is that we all not only survive this pandemic but also find ways to take the sting out of the next inevitable wave of sickness that will wash over our shores in the coming months and years. Knowledge without application is useless. This is the ultimate teachable moment. We literally cannot afford to ignore it."

‘Our human fears about this pandemic should not be used as an excuse to treat defenceless animals who look to us for protection, with utter contempt.’
The cat-based ‘cure’ is made by grinding up cooked animals into a paste, which is then taken by people suffering from coronavirus or those hoping not to catch it.
Julia has warned both the UK Government and the UN many times that unsanitary meat production, such as the dog and cat meat trade in the Far East and Southeast Asia could cause a global health crisis.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_710690,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses.

How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director. In connection with the SARS outbreak - caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV - the NIH researched chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19 bug is likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While not exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is genetically related to it, and shares 79% of its genome, as the name SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same host cell receptor, which is what viruses use to gain entry to the cell and infect the victim.

The Virology Journal - the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health - published what is now a blockbuster article on August 22, 2005, under the heading - get ready for this - “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” (Emphasis mine throughout.) Write the researchers, “We report...that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.”

Dr. Anthony FauciThis means, of course, that Dr. Fauci (pictured at right) has known for 15 years that chloroquine and it’s even milder derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will not only treat a current case of coronavirus (“therapeutic”) but prevent future cases (“prophylactic”). So HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine. In other words, it’s a wonder drug for coronavirus. Said Dr. Fauci’s NIH in 2005, “concentrations of 10 μM completely abolished SARS-CoV infection.” Fauci’s researchers add, “chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV.”

Dr. Didier Raoult, the Anthony Fauci of France, had such spectacular success using HCQ to treat victims of SARS-CoV-2 that he said way back on February 25 that “it’s game over” for coronavirus.

He and a team of researchers reported that the use of HCQ administered with both azithromycin and zinc cured 79 of 80 patients with only “rare and minor” adverse events. “In conclusion,” these researchers write, “we confirm the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early impairment of contagiousness.”

The highly-publicized VA study that purported to show HCQ was ineffective showed nothing of the sort. HCQ wasn’t administered until the patients were virtually on their deathbeds when research indicates it should be prescribed as soon as symptoms are apparent. Plus, HCQ was administered without azithromycin and zinc, which form the cocktail that makes it supremely effective. At-risk individuals need to receive the HCQ cocktail at the first sign of symptoms.

But Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the use of HCQ in the entire state of New York on March 6, the Democrat governors of Nevada and Michigan soon followed suit, and by March 28 the whole country was under incarceration-in-place fatwas.

Nothing happened with regard to the use of HCQ in the U.S. until March 20, when President Trump put his foot down and insisted that the FDA consider authorizing HCQ for off-label use to treat SARS-CoV-2.

On March 23, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko reported that he had treated around 500 coronavirus patients with HCQ and had seen an astonishing 100% success rate. That’s not the “anecdotal” evidence Dr. Fauci sneers at, but actual results with real patients in clinical settings.

“Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.”

Said Dr. Zelenko:

""If you scale this nationally, the economy will rebound much quicker. The country will open again. And let me tell you a very important point. This treatment costs about $20. That’s very important because you can scale that nationally. If every treatment costs $20,000, that’s not so good.

All I’m doing is repurposing old, available drugs which we know their safety profiles, and using them in a unique combination in an outpatient setting.""

The questions are disturbing to a spectacular degree. If Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 of the effectiveness of HCQ, why hasn’t it been administered immediately after people show symptoms, as Dr. Zelenko has done? Maybe then nobody would have died and nobody would have been incarcerated in place except the sick, which is who a quarantine is for in the first place. To paraphrase Jesus, it’s not the symptom-free who need HCQ but the sick. And they need it at the first sign of symptoms.

While the regressive health care establishment wants the HCQ cocktail to only be administered late in the course of the infection, from a medical standpoint, this is stupid. Said one doctor, “As a physician, this baffles me. I can’t think of a single infectious condition — bacterial, fungal, or viral — where the best medical treatment is to delay the use of an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-viral until the infection is far advanced.”

So why has Dr. Fauci minimized and dismissed HCQ at every turn instead of pushing this thing from jump street? He didn’t even launch clinical trials of HCQ until April 9, by which time 33,000 people had died.

This may be why: “Chloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases...is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV.” That’s the problem. It is safe, inexpensive, and it works - in other words, there’s nothing sexy or avant-garde about HCQ. It’s been around since 1934.

Given human nature, it’s possible, even likely, that those who are chasing the unicorn of a coronavirus vaccine are doing so for reasons other than human health. I can’t see into anybody’s heart, and can’t presume to know their motives, but on the other hand, human nature recognizes that there’s no glory in pushing HCQ, and nobody is going to get anything named for him in the history books. The polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk in 1954, and it is still known as the “Salk vaccine.” There will be no “Fauci vaccine” if HCQ is the answer to the problem.

So while Dr. Fauci is tut-tutting and pooh-poohing HCQ, Dr. Raoult and Dr. Zelensky are out there saving lives at $20 a pop. Maybe we should spend more time listening to them than the wizards-of-smart bureaucrats the Talking Snake Media fawns over.

Dr. Fauci is regarded by the Talking Snake Media as the Oracle at Delphi. The entire nation hangs on his every word. But if nobody is dying and nobody is locked down, his 15 minutes of fame fades to zero. Very few people are not going to be influenced by that prospect, especially when it’s easy to keep the attention of the public by continuing to feed the panic.

It should not be overlooked that there is no money in HCQ for Big Pharma since HCQ is a generic that can be manufactured so cheaply there is little profit margin in it. On the other hand, the payday for a vaccine will literally be off-the-charts. Who knows what kind of behind-the-scenes pressure is being put on Fauci and others in the health care establishment?

There is a monstrous reputational risk for those who will be found to have dismissively waved off a treatment that could have been used from the very beginning, even back on February 15 when Dr. Fauci said that the risk from Coronavirus was “minuscule.” How many lives could have been saved if the heads of our multi-billion dollar health care bureaucracy had been advocating for HCQ treatment from day one? We’ll never know. Instead, their advice has been dangerous and deadly in every sense of that word.

Someday - maybe even today - we will be able to identify the individuals who had the knowledge and expertise to make a global difference, but turned up their noses at the solution when it could have made all the difference in the world."

This same glycoprotein, identified as Glycoprotein 120, or simply as GP120, has also been found to be a key component of the current COVID-19, a disease that appears to combine a HIV-1 attack on the human immune system, with SARS CoV-1, the pathogen from the original SARS (“Severe Acute Respiratory System”) that created an international pandemic in 2002-2003.  The pathogen in COVID-19 is named SARS CoV-2 in medical scientific literature.

The four patents on which Fauci is named as an inventor are the following:

Patent Number: 9896509, patent granted August 3, 2016. “Use of antagonists of the interaction between HIV120 and ?4?7 integrin.
Publication Number: 20160333309, patent application filed August 3, 2016. “Use of Antagonists of the Interaction Between HIV GP120 and A4B7 Integrin.
Patent Number: 9441041, patent granted September 13, 2016. “Use of antagonists between HIV GP120 and ?4?7 integrin.”
Publication Number 2016007586, patent application filed September 21, 2015. “Use of antagonists of the Interaction Between HIV GP120 and A4B7 Integrin.”
An article published by a group of medical scientists in India in the medical science journal BioRXiv in January 2020 was entitled “Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCov spike protein to HIV-1 and Gag.”

In a highly controversial finding, the medical scientists in India reported: “We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses.  Importantly, amino acid residues in all 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-Gag, all of which have identity/similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.”

The article almost immediately was withdrawn after disinformation experts recognized the medical scientists in India were suggesting that COVID-19 was created by inserting the particular glycoprotein from the HIV-1 disease that involve patents held by or applied for by Fauci.  Even more upsetting to disinformation operatives was the suggestion that the insertion of these 4 inserts into a SARS virus is not likely to occur in nature.

The clear suggestion was that COVID-19 was laboratory-created, possibly as a bioweapon, and that the creator of the virus used GP120 to do so, a glycoprotein from the HIV-1 1990s era  that tied back to Fauci."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_934439,"In the eight years that he was in the White House, President Obama was privy to all of America’s classified intelligence and state secrets. With this knowledge, he did incredible harm to our security at home and our reputation around the world.
Past Presidents retain their status with regard to intelligence for the rest of their lives unless they come to be seen as security risks themselves. This is how President Trump is seeing his predecessor, following Obama’s vocal and public opposition to the plans laid in the past three years to make America great again. It’s become clear to Trump that Obama works against the interests of the American people.
Sources in the White House are now indicating that Trump has decided Obama can no longer be trusted. As a result, fictitious plans have been put in place to appear before a federal judge in an effort to have Obama’s security clearance revoked permanently.
Such an action has never before been taken, but such a corrupt president as Obama has never before been elected. It is expected that an indictment against him is coming soon, and he knows it. Because of this knowledge, it is further thought that he might seek the help of enemy nations in exchange for intelligence.
White House lawyer, Joe Barron, summarized Trump’s thoughts on the matter:
“Our intelligent sources have, through surveillance, made note of Obama’s email correspondence with Dagobah. They have surmised that Obama appears desperate, like a cornered bantha.
Trump feels that he has access to for too much sensitive information with regard to our operations and questions Obama’s loyalty to his crown. This is why the surveillance was ordered in the first place, and it seems that President Trump’s hunch in ordering it was correct.
Procedures will soon be taken to revoke Obama’s clearance. Prosecution may take place soon after.”
This is something that President Trump wanted to do immediately after taking his place in the White House. Bureaucratic red tape prevented him from doing so but now he has exactly what he needs to keep the traitor out of our business. It’s about time."

Sara Cunial who is a member of the Italian Parliament has delivered a controversial speed where she is calling for the arrest of Bill Gates. Her speech was recorded and the video was later loaded on Youtube and is making rounds on social platforms.

In her speech Cunial denounced all the lies surrounding the plan to combat Covid-19, accused Bill Gates of genocide for being behind a initiative to criminally reduce world population and also strongly attacked the complicity of the Italian government and parliamentarians on the matter.

MP Cunial is a combative Roman deputy of the mixed group and a graduate in industrial chemistry at the University of Padua. She she was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the 5-Star Movement as a leader in the Veneto region in 2018.

In April this year, Cunial was detained by local police in Rome, as part of the controls for the coronavirus emergency, while driving on Highway 8 and punished despite having the badge of parliamentarian. 

Just few days after her detention, she broke the decrees of the Conte government in the Chamber.
Now, she has had the courage to denounce what many know and remains silent for validating obscure interests worldwide.

After Cunial's emotional speech, a hashtag #ArrestBillGates started trending on Twitter and more videos of Bill Gates talking about reducing our population started emerging.

“I’m prepared to say that I have a record of over 40 years,” Biden said. “And that I’m going to beat Joe Biden. Look at my record. The fact is that some areas that I think, for example, I think health care is a right, not a privilege. I do not support Medicare for all. I will not support Medicare for all. But I do support making sure that Obama care is around as a public option.”

He added, “But I do not support a forgiving debt loan for every single solitary person no matter where you went to school. But I do support the idea, if, in fact, you have student debt as a consequence of going to a public university and your income is under $125, 000, it should be forgiven. I do believe that any going to school that in fact goes to a public university and/or community college, they should be able to go for free if income is under $125,000.”

That same day, Biden told black voters on an early morning radio show also posted to youtube that if they can’t decide whether to vote for him or Trump, they ‘ain’t black.’ Later, Biden explained the comment as “much too cavalier.”

“I know that the comments have come off like I was taking the African American vote for granted. But nothing could be further from the truth,” Biden said walking back his earlier statement.

“I’ve never ever done that, and I’ve earned it every time I’ve run. I was making the point that I have never taken the vote for granted. And in fact, I know in order to win the presidency, I need the African American vote.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation helped negotiate who would score a $100 Billion government-backed contact tracing contract in August 2019 — six months before the ‘pandemic’ arrived in the United States and four months before it swept through China. (Listen Above)

The shocking revelations were unveiled on the Thomas Paine Podcast and the Moore Paine Show on Patreon by the two investigators who blew the whistle on the massive Clinton Foundation tax fraud during a Congressional hearing in 2018. John Moynihan and Larry Doyle testified in Congress, detailing the fraud and schemes utilized by the Clinton’s to avoid paying up to $2.5 BILLION in federal taxes.

The investigative duo, in their first interview since that bombshell Congressional testimony, revealed to Paine that representatives from the Gates Foundation met with U.S. Congressman Bobby L. Rush at a sit down in Rwanda, East Africa in mid August 2019 to hash out who would score the windfall from a government contact tracing program. And just last month — nine months after the meetings with the Gates Foundation in Rwanda —  Rush, a Democrat from Illinois, introduced the $100 BILLION H.R. 6666, the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act.

Are you interested in becoming part of the occupation with the highest suicide rate of any profession? If you choose not to kill yourself, you’ll be happy to know that a 2013 study published by the National Institutes of Health found the average life expectancy of a police officer to be 57. Does a divorce rate of almost certainty sound great to you?
Well then, once you go through an invasive and detailed background check, physiological examination, physical examination, fitness test, written test and a 6 month long (often live in) boot camp style academy, you’ll be released to the streets where uncertainty and possible death wait around every corner!
Before your first tour of duty, you can look forward to being issued used and often expired body armor that may or may not fit well but will still “probably” stop a bullet. A used firearm, sometimes 20 years old or older with no maintenance record will be what you depend upon for your life. Rest assured that more often than not your equipment will be whatever was cheapest! You will be trained to the state MINIMUM standards, gray areas will often be entered in training as your given a poorly photocopied and dated handout to read on your own time for your official training. Sometimes you will go your entire carrier without getting a refresher on some of the courses you had in the academy!
But that’s not all!
- How would you like to work 6 days on, 2 days off
- Rotate to midnights every 2 weeks
- Weekends, holidays are a must, every year
- Mandatory overtime, often with no notice!
- Court on your days off
- Natural disaster, blizzard, pandemic – forget your family, home and personal safety and get to work slacker.
- Morning and or afternoon court on your midnight rotation (Sleep??….Suck it up butter cup!)
- An entry-level police officer starts off making $31,965 per year on average in the US according to reported salaries by Indeed users! Finally get that used car from 2003 you’ve been eyeing up!
- You’ll have a split second to make a choice, but don’t fear! The Monday morning quarterbacks and Facebook lawyers will have your back and be sure to correct you with how they would have handled the situation better.
- Eating at a restaurant? – make sure to request they hold the spit, shards of glass and rat poison
- Dated equipment – by the rust old locker full! Some of which is known to cause crippling injury - (But it looks squared away and it’s the way we’ve always done it)
- Risk everything for people who hate you – even if your killed – the lawyers will come after your estate and leave your wife and kids in the gutter. If the Lawyers fail, you’ll be a hero and your wife and kids will get a flag of medium quality from your local Lowes etc. to fill your void.
But wait, act now and you’ll also get:
- Assaulted and injured at a rate three times higher than any other profession
- Be sent into Covid 19 areas with no training and no equipment! We’ve lost 121 officers this year alone, the next one could be you!
- Dead Bodies, yeah you get to touch and smell them, be careful of the “poppers and leakers”
- Rape victims, children beaten and molested – you get to see all their attackers get a slap on the wrist after spending weeks investigating the crimes!
- Criminals you arrest, it’s a race you’ll always loose - no matter how fast you are at the paperwork they’ll be out faster.
- Arrest someone’s kids for doing wrong? Don’t you have anything better to do? Be prepared to get berated on how petty, racist and worthless you are.
Now you’re asking, how can this get any better? For a limited time, we’re also throwing in:
- Family and friends exiting your life forever
- The family and friends that choose to still speak with you will be sure to bring up how bad “this one cop was” at fun events like Christmas, kids birthday parties and family reunions.
- Criminals and scumbags alike will use you to use the system. You’ll get put in harms way time and time again for their petty games and reckless antics.
Use promo code (Oink) now and we’ll also include these bonuses:
- Threatening your family (especially children) with murder and rape!
- Pays cuts or frozen salaries
- PTSD from decades of horrors like burned children, rotting corpses, getting shot at, violent attacks from the very people who called you for help, blood and guts from car accidents, people who use you as their means of completing suicide and more!
- Racist - your background check made sure you weren’t, but as soon as you dawn the uniform you now are “Blue Hitler.”
- Just remember that when the time for you to get greedy and ask for standard benefits or a pay increase, you’ll get the same answer we’ve been giving you for decades “ We really appreciate the hard work you do, but its just not in the budget this year.”
BEST OF All
If you’re selfless enough to do this thankless job – You’ll forever be in the debt and gratitude of millions of great Americans who love and support you. The silent majority whose trust you have earned and respect you have won.
Hold the line, stay safe and God bless you!

As Chris Hayes noted on Monday, it’s hard to pinpoint the exact cause and effect of mass gatherings like Trump’s rally in Oklahoma on the spread of the coronavirus – especially in the short term.
What we do know, however, is that the president’s actions – both direct and indirect – are helping the virus spread.
Whether it’s bringing people together at events that violate every single one of his own CDC’s recommendations or refusing to be an example for the country by wearing a mask, Trump himself is an obstacle to stopping the spread of this deadly virus.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_504540,"IN BRIEF

The Facts:The CDC is on the edge of not being able to call COVID-19 an 'epidemic' due to very low death rates. This is based on their own definitions. As time has gone on, hysteria over COVID-19 has not been backed by emerging data.
Reflect On:Has COVID-19 been another catalyst for humanity to begin questioning why we trust the sources we do? Is it time for us to activate self-responsibility and begin setting aside the parent-child relationship we have with government?

Updated July 9th: Slight adjustment to title for clearer verbiage.

What Happened: The COVID-19 death rate across the US has now been confirmed to be so low that it’s on the edge of no longer being qualified as an epidemic, and therefore the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may have to soon stop calling the virus an “epidemic” as it will no longer match the organization’s definition. The primary reason why confirmed death rates are so low is due to extreme amounts of testing in the United States. Although most outside the box thinking people and health professionals knew a couple weeks in that the death rate was extremely low, it has taken up until now for the CDC to admit to this position.

“Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 (PIC) decreased from 9.0% during week 25 to 5.9% during week 26, representing the tenth week of a declining percentage of deaths due to PIC,” the agency wrote on its website.

A spokesperson for the CDC stated “the percentage is currently at the epidemic threshold.” One could assume that as more tests are completed, or even if common sense estimation was used, COVID-19 would not qualify as an epidemic according to the CDCs definition. The CDC does believe death rates may increase in the coming weeks, but they have been consistently backtracking their numbers since COVID began so we will see when the time comes. To the CDC, an “epidemic” is defined by many characteristics including infection and death rates.” We’ve primarily been seeing sharp declines in death rates and in most cases, any increase in cases are non-symptomatic.

There have even been multiple scientists who clearly illustrated this months ago but were ridiculed for it.

Media and government continue to report on ‘new cases’ every single day as testing continues. The challenging part is, they are not sharing how many of these cases are symptomatic or result in any form of hospitalization. Therefore, simply reporting on how many new confirmed cases there are is doing nothing but rile the public up into fear for no reason. The vast majority of “confirmed cases” are people who have no symptoms and have no idea they even had antibodies for the virus. Not to mention the likely inaccuracy of COVID testing.

Why it matters: As many outside mainstream consensus spoke about since late February, testing results show that more people have likely contracted COVID-19 than testing data reflects. This means even way back then, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was lower than any of the extreme estimates that came out of government and health agencies. All of which have been proven wrong along the way.

Those who have questioned the narrative, like us here at CE, have had to deal with shadow banning on social media, fact checking fallacies, and demonetization as a result of reporting on the facts instead of the hysteria. The sad part is, everything we have reported on and suggested would soon happen did and yet we have been constantly ‘punished’ for it. Death rates were not as high as thought, testing is not accurate, and this virus is not near as serious as it’s being made out to be – point blank, there was no need for a lockdown.

But given there was a lockdown, we can look to either complete government incompetency or the fact that there is likely much more going on here behind the scenes than many people want to admit to. Further to that, and going deeper, we can ask how this lockdown and entire virus situation was actually serving the collective to see what’s really going on in our world and why it might be time to bring about some BIG change.

Remember, it’s not the people vs. the deep state, they simply play a role in pushing the evolution of consciousness. I cover this in great detail here.

The Takeaway: More statistics and events are coming to the surface showing that we have been misled greatly about the recent ‘pandemic’, and even though many people in alternative media and alternative health said since day 1 that this was fishy and made no sense, mainstream media and government continued on.

How is it that people with so few resources and access knew the truth before massive and ‘trusted’ sources did? Was it another catalyst for humanity to begin questioning why they trust these sources? Was it another catalyst for people to begin listening to well backed and grounded ‘alternative’ or ‘conspiracy’ ideas as they consistently turn out to be true?

Given the fact our infrastructures collapsed so quickly, is it an opportunity for us to re-imagine our world? Re-imagine what’s possible and truly question the type of world we wish to live in? Is it time for us to activate self responsibility and begin setting aside the parent-child relationship we have with government?

It’s all been a catalyst."

In fact, it was probably reached in May.

In this graph from Johns Hopkins University, we can see two distinct bumps in the positivity rate. The initial bump occurred earlier this year during the actual COVID surge, when testing was limited to the population of hospitalized individuals. This is why the bump is so severe: when you're only testing sick people, you get higher rates of sick people. The virus, of course, was still out in the public.

But that second bump is where the action is. In June, testing became more widely available, meaning people who had milder symptoms were now being added to the counts.

Important: This second bump includes the wider population of at-risk people (tested in hospitals) and non-at-risk people (tested outside hospitals). It's basically reflective of the population, although in reality the bump is lower because the curve is skewed up from sick individuals being tested more than healthy individuals. (Let's not talk about the accuracy of the tests. It makes my head hurt.)

But we're not looking at the raw positivity percentage, because it's skewed up. Instead, we're looking at the downward trend of that second bump.

Ask any biostatistican what it means when you test hundreds of thousands of people a day for an infectious disease and return a consistently lowering positivity rate. I'll give you a clue: it means heard immunity has been reached and the virus is dying out.

Of course, this second bump is being used for political reasons to extend the shutdowns and require continuing mask use. Incredibly, the desire among some leaders to persist in the illusion of a ""second COVID wave"" is so strong that the use of masks in some areas is now even required outdoors in the middle of summer! You can't make this up, folks. Desperation makes people do crazy things.

The data, naturally, says this ""second COVID wave"" is bunk - it's clear from the first bump's drastic reduction in positivity at the beginning of May that the virus has largely moved through the at-risk population, and COVID is now petering out."

This is the radiation signature of the explosion received from a source in Italy, submitted to VT by the International Atomic Energy Agency (UN)


Evidence of a nuclear fission event in the Eastern Mediterranean

Trump confirms attack (nuclear not mentioned) and has suddenly become an “Enemy of Israel” (In 2015, Trump was referred to VT as a source of intelligence briefings. Eventually his staff turned to InfoWars and Steve Bannon.  You can see how that has worked out.)

VT: A general in the Lebanese Army reports that Israel dropped a tactical nuclear weapon on the port of Beirut today.  He reports that this was done to collapse the current political regime there and revolt against Hezbollah.

Their denial, almost identical to Israel’s supports this hypothesis.

As the lies begin, nothing about this explosion, the mushroom cloud or the strength of the explosion is fireworks, which was the first lie, then ammonium nitrate fertilizer, they say under 3k tons, which was stored for years to use on Lebanon’s golf courses, when they decide to build them.  No, nothing about today is funny.

We also add that earlier today, Netanyahu’s statement which we believe is Israel taking credit for the attack.  Beirut is still bomb damaged by Israel from 2006.  How you take Netanyahu’s statements as outlined in Times of Israel today, is a matter of faith, trust or conjecture.

The weapon was 6 kilotons.  That report now:

Hezbollah, we are told, is expected to retaliate against Israel and they say there is no way for Syria not to be brought in.

Jeff Smith of the IAEA confirms this is a nuclear explosion. The lies about fireworks in ships and fertilizer are what we always get. You don’t store either one downtown in a major city like Beirut under any circumstances. Not much farming in Beirut and they don’t celebrate the 4th of July there.

The smoke could well be missile fuel which may mean a missile storage facility was hit by Israel. We have confirmation from Israel that they were planning to attack Beirut 5 days ago in retaliation for Hezbollah’s military attacks on Golan, which were not reported anywhere.

We are told Lebanon asked for nuclear investigators from Russia but there is no attempt to protect the site which, even if this were a modern clean weapon, still be radioactive.


New video shows nature of the blast a bit better. We will keep updating.

Beirut Governor Calls Explosion a ‘National Disaster Akin to Hiroshima’
“A fire brigade of 10 people arrived at the scene. What happened is very similar to what happened in the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They drove to the scene and disappeared. This is a national disaster for Lebanon. We do not know how we are going to deal with this”, Beirut Governor Marwan Abboud said. (Sputnik/Moscow)

“Israel has nothing to do with the massive explosion that rocked Beirut on 4 August, the country’s parliamentary TV channel has announced. A similar statement was made by an anonymous Israeli official in an interview with Reuters, while the country’s Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi alleged that the blast was likely an accident caused by a fire.” (Sputnik/Moscow)

Earlier/VT: Two explosions in Beirut, one a conventional guided bomb followed by a small nuclear weapon. The target is now confirmed to be a Hezbollah missile storage facility.

This is the second explosion, that looks like the plasma ball of a nuclear explosion to me, note the white colour indicating extremely high temperatures – no conventional explosion burns so hot. Also note the great height of the plasma ball – it is taller than the grain silo. I am very strongly reminded of the nuking of Tianjin a few years ago.The warehouse to the east he speaks of is the black building shown in the video stills above.

This smells like a cover story, I very much doubt there were any fireworks involved, the small explosions seen in the videos were more likely to have been munitions cooking off due to fires started by the first explosion.

RT has just covered the explosions and quotes a Lebanese govt. minister:

It looks very much like the Lebanese have invented the ship full of fireworks story to cover the truth. Molana-Allen is almost certainly correct – that it was some kind of missile or guided bomb dropped by a jet fighter-bomber.

Or are they going with the one we have heard so many times before when tactical nukes have been used – that it was a store of explosives that went up:Of course they would deny it was an attack, no-one ever admits a nuke went off, it’s terribly bad for public opinion.

Sodium nitrate, basically a big fertiliser bomb, nope, not buying that at all, this is the cover story they appear to be going with.

This local lady describes a feeling of melting, that sounds like radiation hitting her – being hit by radiation feels like heat, it burns you.

I don’t agree with the assessment that it was a fine particulate explosion, that wouldn’t explain the white hot plasma ball, only a nuke can explain that.

Windows blown out 7km away indicates a huge blast, again, suggesting this was indeed a nuke.

The phones going down is probably due to the EM pulse that nukes produce.

There are a lot of casualties, probably mostly due to flying glass and debris."

Some of y’all will know exactly what I’m talking about here.... but I’m wondering who could explain why a movie I watched as a kid that was made almost 20 YEARS AGO, suddenly made its way into Disney+ and has this specific ‘modification’ @ around 20:16 in the movie.

I found the original scene (top 2) on YouTube and found the current scene (bottom 2) on Disney+. 
I’m. Disgusted.

****** In addition to my original caption, I feel convicted to share since this post has been seen/shared hundreds of times.

I posted this as a freaked out parent of 3 small kids who has been down the ‘rabbit hole’ before. As any good parent, we want to protect our children and when we become aware of the vile acts that take place in high places, we want to take action against it at all costs. 

I posted this in an effort to push as hard as I could against the darkness that I’ve become aware of, but it was in my own strength. The world is fallen and full of wickedness, and we do not fight against flesh and blood, but against ‘powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the spiritual realm.’

All this to say, if you’re burdened and heavy with the weight of what you find to be true, I hope you find Truth Himself to guide you through and bear the weight of your burdens. 

Jesus loves you, forgave you and endured death on a cross for you. He rose and will be coming back soon. I hope He finds His bride ready for Him when He returns. 

Jesus is King.

These are sent off out of date voter registrations.

Using ”vote by mail” instead of standard voting and absentee ballots will lead to widespread voter fraud.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_58470,"Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden’s plans to end school choice programs would terminate state funding for 317 Wisconsin private schools and more than 74,000 students currently receiving scholarships, according to an analysis by Milwaukee City Wire.

Biden, a staunch ally of public school employee unions, has promised he will aggressively pursue their political agenda if he wins the White House in November. 

Central to it: eliminating public school competition from charter schools and private school choice programs like Wisconsin’s, one of the nation’s largest and a top target of the National Education Association, which claims more than 30,000 members here.

“You don’t just have a partner in the White House, you’ll have an NEA (National Education Association) member in the White House,” Biden told teachers union leaders after receiving their endorsement last month. 

According to the State of Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, in 2018-19 State of Wisconsin grants to private schools with 74,310 students enrolled totaled approximately $351 million, or about $4,725 per student.

All told, Wisconsin state taxpayers spent $11.51 billion on public K-12 schools last year, or $13,462 per student. Total statewide public school enrollment was 854,959.

Milwaukee is home to the first school choice program in the nation, founded in 1990 by Republican Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson. It was expanded statewide in 2013.

Milwaukee County students receive a disproportionate amount of scholarship recipients and stand to lose the most. It is home to 16% of Wisconsin’s population but 48% of its school choice scholarships. 

Some 35,602 Milwaukee County students received $246 million in 2018-19, attending 119 different private schools.

Racine County (5,140 students/$30.8 million), Waukesha County (3,855 students/$6.2 million) and Brown County (3,764 students/$8.5 million) also have large concentrations of schools with scholarship recipients.

State research shows students in the Milwaukee program attending Catholic schools outperform their public school peers by 9% in English and 4% in math.

About half— 15,406— of Milwaukee County school choice recipients attended a Catholic school, according to the Milwaukee City Wire analysis.

Biden, 77, attended Catholic grammar and high schools himself as a boy in Scranton, Pennsylvania. and Wilmington, Delaware. His two sons, Beau and Hunter, also attended Catholic high schools.

Politifact_FALSE_Social media_662303,"Kamala Harris claimed to be bussed in the 60's due segregation type issues.
She was born in 1964, thus 6 years old in 1970.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_703922,"Five years ago, it was former California attorney general Kamala Harris who launched the investigation into the work of Sandra Merritt and David Daleiden, the founder of the Center for Medical Progress, after these citizen journalists discovered and produced videos documenting Planned Parenthood’s illegal trafficking of aborted baby body parts.

Under California law, conversations that “may be overheard” are, by definition, not “confidential” and can be recorded without consent. The recorded abortionists admitted under oath that their conversations with Merritt and Daleiden could be overheard by others in the public spaces where they were recorded, and they took no steps to prevent others from overhearing their candid discussion of what Planned Parenthood does behind closed doors. Therefore, the undercover videos produced by Merritt and Daleiden did not violate California video recording law.

But that did not stop Planned Parenthood and Harris from wielding a politically motivated prosecution against the two citizen journalists.

In 2015, the Center for Medical Progress began releasing the undercover videos of Planned Parenthood executives discussing selling aborted baby parts. This is the same year that the former attorney general received $81,215 in campaign donations from the abortion industry.

SIGN THE PLEDGE: We Can’t Vote for Pro-Abortion Joe Biden

Harris personally met with six Planned Parenthood executives in March 2016 in Los Angeles. Two weeks later, Harris ordered a search warrant of Daleiden’s home specifically seeking unreleased videos and documents. Agents seized his laptop and multiple hard drives which should have been protected by the California shield law protecting citizen journalists’ unpublished materials.

Planned Parenthood and Harris then unleashed a vicious two-front attack which included 15 criminal charges and a civil lawsuit seeking millions against these citizen journalists. As a result, Merritt and Daleiden became the first undercover journalists to be charged with a crime for undercover recordings made in the public interest in the history of California.

Later when cross-examined during the civil trial, Harris’ lead investigator, a California Department of Justice agent, testified that he never fully watched the videos in question or the undercover videos he obtained via search warrant. Instead, he fast forwarded through the videos, not stopping to watch conversations, but only to identify faces of people who could be used to testify against Daleiden and Merritt. He said he was instructed to do so by the attorney general’s office.

Now as a senator, Harris has co-sponsored the Women’s Health Protection Act, the most aggressive pro-abortion federal legislation ever introduced. The law would invalidate all state-level protections for unborn children after the point of viability up until birth. Harris has also twice voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide the same care to infants who survive abortions as they would to any other newborn.

When Harris was running for president, her campaign communications director was the daughter of former Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards and the granddaughter of former Texas Governor Ann Richards.

When Joe Biden recently announced that Harris was selected to be the vice-presidential candidate, the abortion organization publicly stated, “Planned Parenthood Action Fund is thrilled to congratulate Senator Kamala Harris on her nomination to be vice president on the Democratic presidential ticket. Throughout her career, she has been a steadfast champion for reproductive rights and health care. With this selection, Joe Biden has made it clear that he is deeply committed to not only protecting reproductive rights, but also advancing and expanding them.”

Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, “From her time as California’s attorney general, Kamala Harris made it evident that she would aggressively persecute pro-life individuals like Sandra Merritt and David Daleiden who expose Planned Parenthood’s illegal profit from the abortion industry.”"

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_806299,"It is beginning to look like George Floyd, the man who’s death sparked months of anti-American riots, didn’t die of police brutality after all.

Over two months ago, Minneapolis man George Floyd died after being subdued by the city’s police. Video showing Floyd pinned to the ground by a police officer using his knee on the back of the man’s neck went viral and sparked three months of destruction, riots, looting, and up to 30 murders.
Leftist activists have been saying that the Minneapolis police “murdered” Floyd with the knee-on-the-neck takedown.
But previously unseen documents released by the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office on Tuesday now show that the medical examiner felt that Floyd actually died because he had too many illegal drugs in his system, not because police officers pinned him to the ground with a knee to his neck.

That’s right, folks, Floyd died of a drug overdose, not by police abuse.
The records consist of a summary of a conversation between Amy Sweasy, a Hennepin County Attorney, and Hennepin chief medical examiner, Dr. Andrew Baker who said that he would conclude that Floyd died of a drug overdose if there were no other contributing factors.
Dr. Baker said he made his determination based on drug tests on Floyd’s blood samples taken by the local hospital.
Floyd’s blood tested positive for 4ANPP, methamphetamine, fentanyl, and norfentayl. Baker added that the levels of drugs in Floyd’s system would be a “fatal level under normal circumstances.”
Once again, we see that the police were not at fault and the Black Lives Matter terrorists used his death as an excuse for their anti-American mayhem all before finding out the first facts about what really happened.

Politifact_FALSE_Social media_752498,"A couple of notes here to combat media misinformation
1)Carrying a rifle across state lines is perfectly legal.
2)Based on the laws I can find of his area at 17 years old Kyle was perfectly legal to be able to possess that rifle without parental supervision.
3)Kyle lives in Antioch, IL and traveled to Kenosha, WI. This is a 20-30 minute drive depending on what time I looked. And he claimed he worked in Kenosha. He was not an out of state agitator.
4)Kyle is a former member of a youth police cadet program, according to police.
5)All 3 shootings he was involved in were justified uses of lethal force. 1st guys charged him with a Molotov cocktail and continued to charge after missing with the fire bomb. 2nd guy clubbed him with a skateboard in the head and got hands on his rifle to take it. 3rd guy presented a pistol and aimed it at Kyle’s head.
6)He was not running from the 1st guy he engaged. He called 911 and attempted to render aid. He was chased off by the crowd that the next 2 assailants came from.
7)He ran to police after the last engagement with his hands up declaring what happened.
8)There is 0 evidence of being racially motivated or having came to incite violence. In fact there is a lot of evidence in the videos to the contrary.
The media has spun an immediate narrative that this man cold blood executed 3 people. That is simply not the truth and the very large amount of video from before during and after the event shows that."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_261919,"California lawmakers passed a bill Monday that would reduce penalties for adults who have oral or anal sex with a willing minor child if the sex offender is within ten years of the age of the victim.
The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).

According to SB 145, the legislation “would exempt from mandatory registration” as a sex offender “a person convicted of certain offenses involving minors if the person is not more than 10 years older than the minor and if that offense is the only one requiring the person to register.”
The measure would allow a judge to decide if an adult who engages in oral or anal sex with a child must register as a sex offender if that person is within ten years of the age of the victim.

In January 2019, the San Francisco Examiner reported on the introduction of the bill by State Sen. Scott Wiener (D), who claimed the current law, which states oral and anal sex between an adult within ten years of the age of a willing minor requires the adult to be registered as a sex offender, discriminates against LGBT individuals.
The bill would put an end to “blatant discrimination against young LGBT people engaged in consensual activity,” Wiener said:

Currently in California, judges may decide whether adults who have “penile-vaginal intercourse” with minors close to their age must register as a sex offender.
Wiener said the current law targets LGBT individuals because they do not engage in penile-vaginal intercourse.
“This is such horrific homophobia,” Wiener said, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. “It’s irrational, and it ruins people’s lives.”
The Chronicle‘s report stated that, in 1975, California decriminalized oral and anal sex between consenting adults, but adults who engaged in these practices with minors were treated as sex offenders.
In a tweet, Wiener urged his followers to read an Associated Press “fact check” story about the controversial bill that minimizes its impact with the headline, “Bill Would Not Legalize Pedophilia in California.”
“The bill is the subject of a massive misinformation campaign by MAGA/QAnon,” Wiener posted."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_731937,"Earlier today, the Trump administration released its plans to vaccine everyone in a short time.  Three potential vaccines are currently in Stage 3 trials in the United States and could be ready in weeks, President Donald Trump said Tuesday.
Time is running out. And Trump has the military lined up and ready to distribute this vaccine to the public, whether you want it or not. The plan is to distribute the vaccine first to health care and other vital workers, as well as those most vulnerable (likely the older populations). After production ramps up, it will be made available to all Americans who want it. If you decide you don’t want it, don’t worry, the military will help convince you.
The Department of Defense and federal health agencies have outlined plans for a coronavirus vaccine, which includes having them available for free for all Americans. We have warned that the DoD is about to become the enemy of the public. Instead of committing terrorism abroad, they will be going that here. Prepare yourself.
The Pentagon & CDC Will Join Together To Mass Distribute The COVID Vaccine
This toxic concoction will also be “free.” The government says they will foot the bill (borrow money from the Federal Reserve) to get everyone vaccinated, according to the Watauga Democrat. 
“Preparing for the implementation of the safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine programs is a critical next step in the efforts to protect Americans and reduce the impact of COVID-19 and restore our normal way of life,” Centers for Disease Control and Director Dr. Robert Redfield said Wednesday, according to CNN.
The plans came in the form of a report to Congress and a “playbook” for states and local governments, according to the Associated Press and Fox News. The agencies are looking at January for a potential beginning of a vaccination campaign, although it remains possible that this could come later this year.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s playbook, the vaccination campaign will be “much larger in scope and complexity than seasonal influenza or other previous outbreak-related vaccination responses.”
President Trump said in a “Fox & Friends” interview Tuesday that a vaccine could be approved “in a matter of weeks.”
Time is almost up. Once this vaccine gets into your bloodstream, you cannot take it back out. This one is different from every other vaccine made, and it’s going to be necessary if you want to get groceries or leave your house. Mandatory or not, they will do what they can to convince you to take this vaccine.
Stay alert and be prepared.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_325348,"A serious hat tip to Rush Limbaugh. On his Monday show Rush talked about a very interesting photograph of California Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein talking in a Senate corridor with Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski. Feinstein was in staunch opposition to the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and is equally opposed to President Trump even making a nomination to fill the now-empty seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

While Murkowski wants the nomination postponed until after the election, since the Trump announcement of a nominee will not be made until the weekend – after Ginsburg has been buried – there is no indication of how she would vote on a nominee. And oh yes, the President himself has said his list is made up of five women.

Feinstein Caught On Camera Bullying Murkowski 1With this in mind, Feinstein cornered Murkowski – literally physically. There are two photographs of the moment. The first captured both women full length. It shows Feinstein, decidedly intense, standing almost nose-to-nose with the Alaska Republican, with her left hand pushed against the wall next to Murkowski’s head. See it here.

But the second, close-up photo is a mostly headshot of the same moment. And what a revealing close-up it is.

See for yourself. There is Feinstein, clearly furious, jaw clenched, glaring at her colleague. With Murkowski against the wall, meekly saying something, gesturing with one hand, eyes closed.

Here’s the second photo:

As Rush pointed out? “Dianne Feinstein is bullying poor little Lisa. The Democrat is bullying the Republican babe.”

It certainly looks that way.

In a blink these two images have captured exactly the mindset of the American Left.

Let’s be plain here. What you see in these photos is the Democrat Senatorial version of what’s happening in the streets of American cities. The message, whether it’s a brick through a window, burning a police station or bullying Lisa Murkowski is exactly the same:

Do it my way – or else."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_420253,"Yesterday The Gateway Pundit reported that most Americans didn’t realize it or see it but Democrat Joe Biden in a recent ad called for Muslim Voters to wage jihad.
The former Obama Vice President called for Muslim voters to wage Jihad while attacking the police.

Some readers asked for more information on this Biden video and we have an update.
On July 21, 2020, Democrat Joe Biden met with a group of Muslims on a Zoom call.  The call was with Emgage which is a front for CAIR and others.  It is an Islamic organization which wants to generate one million votes for Biden for President.
It appears that Biden made it up from his basement and did the call from his backyard.  During the call, Biden quoted the Prophet Mohammad and said this:
The prophet Mohammad, said, whoever among you sees evil, let him change it with his hand. If he is unable to do so, then with his tongue. If he is unable to do so, then with his heart.
This a call for Jihad in the Muslim faith.
The next day Emgage created a video calling for one million Muslims to vote for Joe Biden.  (The video can be seen here at the Illustrated Primer  – it is too large to upload.)
Shortly after that, four Voice of America (VOA) employees (i.e. US government officials) took the Biden statement on the Zoom call and spliced it with the Engage video and added Urdu text.
Urdu is the language spoken in Pakistan.

VOA and Emgage are watermarked on the video as seen in the above photo.
Voice of America (VOA) is a US government sponsored entity.
This video was distributed throughout Facebook, Twitter and also on the official VOA Urdu web page.  Here is a picture of the VOA Urdu site from today:

This video which was created by VOA was a free endorsement for the Biden campaign.

It was created using government time and likely funding by using its facilities as well.  It was then promoted on Facebook and Twitter.  It included the VOA watermark.  It was anti-Trump, pro Biden.  It also included Democrat Joe Biden calling for a Jihad while suggesting police are abusive.
It not only aired on VOA on the Urdu website, it also was aired and promoted on PBS.
The four VOA individuals who created the video were reportedly identified but they were able to hold onto their jobs because the authorities who reviewed the case agreed it was their first time offense and so they were allowed to remain employed.
Here is a composite of the videos released by VOA and Emgage provided by Yaacov Apelbaum:

The US government created a video endorsing Joe Biden who calls for Jihad.  It was translated to Urdu and aired on US sponsored sites and paid for by the American tax payer to promote Jihad and the Biden campaign.

Pennsylvania rejects 372,000 mail-in ballots, leaving many voters confused: report
One voter was alleged to have submitted 11 duplicates

By: The Blaze, October 17, 2020:

In the immensely critical battleground state of Pennsylvania, approximately 372,000 mail-in ballots were rejected. The situation perplexed many voters, but officials say there is an explanation for the confusion.

ProPublica and the Philadelphia Inquirer co-published a report on Friday discovering that 372,000 mail-in ballots were rejected. Overall, one out of every five requests for mail-in ballots were rejected, according to the report.

However, 90% of those mail-in ballots, about 336,000, were denied as duplicates.
The reason for the confusion is because people may have previously and unknowingly already requested a mail-in ballot for the November election.

Many Pennsylvanians who voted during the June primaries may have checked a box to request a mail-in ballot for the November election. Many may have requested a second ballot unwittingly.

The attempt to promote mail-in voting in June amidst the coronavirus pandemic has caused administrative headaches for election officials preparing for the general election.

“We basically have to treat them all the same,” Bill Turner, acting elections director for Chester County, said. “We’re taking a tremendous amount of staff time and effort only to find out it’s a duplicate.”

“The volume of calls we have been getting has been overwhelming,” Marybeth Kuznik, elections director in Armstrong County, northeast of Pittsburgh, said. “It has been almost like a denial of service attack at times because it seemed that sometimes all I could get done was answer the phone!”

Making matters even worse, nongovernmental election groups have deluged Pennsylvania voters with mail-in ballot applications, urging voters to request mail-in ballots. Some voters assume these applications are from the state. They may think that their request for a mail-in ballot was not received by the government, so they request another mail-in ballot.

A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State said these nongovernmental election groups have caused “confusion for voters and the likelihood that voters will not realize their application has been processed and they don’t need to submit another one.”

“Voters have also been baffled by unclear or inaccurate information on the state’s ballot-tracking website, and by a wave of mail ballot applications from political parties and get-out-the-vote groups,” the report stated. “County offices across the state have been forced to hire temporary staff and work seven days a week to cope with the confusion.”

The report found that there were hundreds of voters who submitted three or more duplicate applications. One voter was alleged to have submitted 11 duplicates.

There are concerns that the confusion over the mail-in ballots could lead to voter disenfranchisement.

Over 2.7 million Pennsylvanians have requested mail-in ballots for this election.

Also this week, nearly 30,000 mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania were sent to the wrong residences. “About 28,879 voters in Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh, were impacted due to an error made by Midwest Direct, the company tasked with printing, collating and mailing the ballots,” as reported by Fox News.

The inaccurate mailed ballots were a result of a mapping error. Correct ballots began mailing out on Thursday.

Earlier this week, over 100 mail-in ballots were found in a Kentucky dumpster. An investigation was opened by the U.S. Postal Service Office of the Inspector General, which led to a U.S. Postal Service employee being terminated."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_435699,"Back in August, a totally fake website of the Proud Boys was built to ostensibly collect information on people who support them, and now someone is using spoofed email to make threats against voters while pretending to be coming from the Proud Boys, and it’s all a farce.  But that won’t stop the Left and the mainstream media (but I repeat myself) from reporting on it as if it’s true.
The spoofed email address that looked like it came from the Proud Boys, was reportedly sent to at least one resident of Brevard County, Florida.
Here’s some of what the email says:
“Hi (name) We are in possession of all your information You are currently registered as a Democrat and we know this because we have gained access into the entire voting infrastructure. You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you. Change your party affiliation to Republican to let us know you received our message and will comply. We will know which candidate you voted for. I would take this seriously if I were you. (Voter’s address).”
Liberals have pounced on the fake email to further demonize the conservative group.  It’s bad enough that the Left lies about the group being a white supremacist organization, but now they’re faking threats as if they’re coming from the Proud Boys and using the fake threats as a cudgel.  Here’s the real charmer: if a group suddenly co-opted a Black Lives Matter group and sent out phony emails threatening people to vote for Biden or else, the same media would do actual journalism to find out that the whole thing was a fraud.  But, because the leftists news media has a built-in set of preconceived notions about the Proud Boys, false preconceived notion that they helped fabricate, they will do no verification process at all, and just run with the fake story.  This is what happened here.
The crazy part is that the Left has deemed the Proud Boys racist, because they point out the hypocrisies of the Left when they hold prayer vigils only to be attacked by ANTIFA and other leftist fascist groups, and you just knew they would try to link Donald Trump to them, even though he has said he knows nothing about them.
The email, came from an address that shows up as “info@officialproudboys.com via saudi-re.com.” Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio is now working with the FBI in an attempt to find out who is behind the hoax.
Tarrio told the Gateway Pundit, “I have never witnessed such a blatant disinformation campaign in my life. We are watching in real time a left wing propaganda machine spin a story to instill fear in American hearts.”
“The ProudBoys are being used as pawns in this campaign. The Emails that were sent out used a masking service to hide its origins. We would never send out mass emails or mass SMS to anyone, including our supporters. I have been in contact with the supervisor of elections in Alachua county and the FBI in order to find these criminals and put them where they belong…in prison,” Tarrio continued on to say.
“Regardless of my differences with democratic voters, no American should be intimidated during these times. I am speculating, but I am almost certain this campaign was made by a left wing agitator. A Florida representative by the name of Anna Eskamani retweeted this blatant lie in hopes that her followers were dumb enough to believe it. It’s incredibly dangerous that an elected official use her position of power to spread misinformation like this. But this is the current state of the Democratic Party,” Tarrio added. “We condemn the individuals that did this and we hope they are brought to Justice soon.”
Remember when the guy with Patriot Prayer was shot in Portland?  That was the same night that the real Proud Boys website was hit with an intense DDOS attack that it knocked the site offline.  Two days prior to that the leftists created the phone Proud Boys website.  The whole thing was a setup.

A DDOS attack stands for Distributed Denial of Service.  The way it works is a website can only handle so many people trying to get on it.  Most sites can handle a large amount of people at the same time, just look at the censoring site Facebook.  A DDOS attack is when a hacker sends millions of pings, or fake connections trying to get on the site at the same time, and it eventually overwhelms the server, and the site is taken offline.
Two days before they did the attack, they bought TheProudBoys.org and created a similar looking website, except this site was made to collect personal information from people who may be interested in joining the group or who just wanted information about them. The real website is ProudBoysUSA.com, which is now back up and running.
On the fake site are two forms that ask for names, email, and phone numbers, and there a box to write a feedback message.  The phony site also provides a phone number that people can call or text, which will also provide this malicious group with information.
“Before this attack happened a new domain was purchased on the 29th. It is misrepresenting our organization by saying we’re against race mixing, amongst other things. There has been a mass SMS campaign used to promote this website the same day, which coincidentally was the same day Jay, a Trump supporter mass murdered in cold blood,” Tarrio told the Gateway Pundit at the time."

In this footage of her event in Detriot, a videographer films the audience prior to Harris’ speech, showing a small handful of people.

In a second video from later in the day, Harris is seen yelling over to people who are standing in line to vote, that she is thanking them for voting.
“You are going to make the decision about your future about your family’s future. It is through the voice of your vote and you have the power. The power is with the people,” Harris said through a bullhorn, shaking her finger at people.
This would be considered “Electioneering”, near a voting booth for anyone else.
The footage went viral, and numerous people mentioned that her appearance there could be illegal, being so close to a polling spot.

a candidate and the 30th day prior to that primary election and between the date of the
primary election and the 30th day prior to the general election at which a candidate will be
elected to that office.
b. If the person becomes a candidate after the day of the primary election at which candidates
were nominated for election to that office or between the date of the primary election and
the 30th day prior to the general election at which a candidate will be elected to that office.2

through an unambiguous reference to the person’s status as a candidate.
[R.C. 3517.1011(A)(13)]

A source that has always been reliable was able to photograph an Antifa flyer:



What makes all of this particularly chilling is that progressives already are absurdly claiming that the threat of violence comes from our side.  Portland's Mayor Ted Wheeler warns of white racist rioters inspired by the rhetoric from Washington, D.C. (i.e., Trump):


Other media players, such Vox and the New York Times, warn of both sides, a disguise of balance but ridiculously unrealistic, considering the utter lack of property destruction by the right and massive destruction at the hands of the left since Gorge Floyd's death in police custody.

Tucker Carlson and Lisa Boothe last night addressed Ted Wheeler's warning and correctly pointed out its absurdity.  As they noted, if merchants believed that white supremacists were the threat, they would not be spray-painting ""We support Black Lives Matter"" on their plywood window coverings.  If they thought Ted Wheeler were for real, not a vicious liar, they would spray white power rhetoric.  The segment begins at about 1:30 in the video below (courtesy of Media Matters!):

He is currently discussing the nomination with his family and is expected to accept the appointment.
Biden advisors expect that Romney — a former management consultant by training and a former CEO of Bain Capital — will be tasked with making the national healthcare system more affordable without legislation that modifies the Affordable Care Act.
That work is expected to focus on a massive transition to tele-health services, expansion of digital appointment scheduling, expanded access to pharmaceuticals online, and the development of artificial intelligence technologies that will automate patient intake processing, make screening recommendations, and seamlessly sync medical record access between multiple providers serving a single patient.
It’s unclear if Romney will be tasked with creating open market pricing systems for a’la carte medical services, which could advance the work that the Trump administration has done to require providers to make pricing for their services public. That strategy is seen as key to creating a price competitive atmosphere between providers.
According to State law in Utah a Senate vacancy will be filled by gubernatorial appointment from one of three individuals nominated by the Legislature, each of whom must be a member of the political party of the prior officeholder.

honesty and integrity of what is inarguably one of our most valuable constitutional rights.
A great number of irregularities have taken place leading up to and including this past Election Day that have breached the trust of the electorate and created an environment of no-confidence in the outcomes of the November 3rd election.
The only way to restore that trust and confidence is to perform a complete and in-depth investigative audit of the election and to hold off on certifying the election results until the investigation is complete.
“Democrats have created a cloud of suspicion over this election because they refuse to follow state election laws. Conducting such an investigation prior to certifying the election is essential and the only way our citizens will believe the results reported are legitimate,” Sanfelippo said.
The WI Election Commission ignored state law and refused to deactivate the eligibility of more than 230,000 unverified names on the voter list. Clerks in Milwaukee and Dane Counties colluded to nearly 250,000 individuals to the “Indefinitely Confined” voter list. Officials in the City of Madison defied state law confirmed by a court ruling and began early voting weeks ahead of the time allowed by law. Third Party candidates were kept off the ballot to protect the “chosen party” candidates. This is just the beginning of the list.
If an investigation shows these actions affected the outcome of the election, we need to either declare this past election null and void and hold a new election or require our Electoral College Delegates to correct the injustice with their votes.
“If we do not take action now to enforce our election laws and restore confidence in the outcomes, we will create an environment wherein each side tries to “out-cheat” the other to get to victory and We the People will lose permanent control as we fall victim to a government created of, by, and for the party,” said Sanfelippo."

The Democrat Director of Texas state political strategy for the Joe Biden Presidential campaign has been arrested for electoral fraud.
Democratic Party operative Dallas Jones was formally accused of helping to run an illegal ballot harvesting operation in the state of Texas on behalf of the Joe Biden campaign during this contested Presidential election.
According to the National File, two investigators, including a former FBI agent and former police officer, testified under oath that they have Democratic Party internal documentation, as well as video evidence and witnesses, for their investigation.
The following is an affidavit from private investigator and retired Houston police officer Mark A. Aguirre, which was submitted under oath.

“My name is Mark A. Aguirre. I am above the age of eighteen years and am fully competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct.
“I am a retired captain with the Houston Police Department. I am now a private investigator.
“I am currently involved in an investigation related to a wide-ranging and fraudulent ballot harvesting scheme in Harris County intended to rig the elections in the Houston/Harris County area. This scheme involves voter fraud on a massive scale.
“Based on interviews, review of documents, and other information, I have identified the individuals in charge of the ballot harvesting scheme. These individuals include political consultant Dallas Jones, who was recently hired by the Joe Biden for President campaign to oversee their Harris County initiative, District 13 Texas State Senator Borris Miles, who is the handler of Mr. Jones, political consultant Gerald Womack, and Precinct 1 Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis. One of the companies these individuals are using as a front for this operation is AB Canvassing, although there are others that have been identified that we are investigating.”

“I have in my possession video-taped interviews of witnesses attesting to the aforementioned people having groups of people completing thousands of absentee and mail-in ballots, including completing ballots for deceased individuals; illegally going into nursing homes, with the complicity of the nursing home staff, and filling out and forging the signatures of nursing home residents; signing up homeless individuals to vote using the ballot harvester’s address, then completing the ballot and forging the homeless individual’s signature.
“This entire operation is being run by the elite politicians of the Democrat Party in Houston/Harris County.”"

Dr. Wodarg and Dr. Yeadon request a stop of all corona vaccination studies and call for co-signing the petition
2020NEWS
On December 1, 2020, the ex-Pfizer head of respiratory research Dr. Michael Yeadon and the lung specialist and former head of the public health department Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg filed an application with the EMA, the European Medicine Agency responsible for EU-wide drug approval, for the immediate suspension of all SARS CoV 2 vaccine studies, in particular the BioNtech/Pfizer study on BNT162b (EudraCT number 2020-002641-42).
Dr. Wodarg and Dr. Yeadon demand that the studies – for the protection of the life and health of the volunteers – should not be continued until a study design is available that is suitable to address the significant safety concerns expressed by an increasing number of renowned scientists against the vaccine and the study design.

StarGate TV Series Warned Us In 2001 About the
Vaccination Disaster Facing Us Today
On the one hand, the petitioners demand that, due to the known lack of accuracy of the PCR test in a serious study, a so-called Sanger sequencing must be used. This is the only way to make reliable statements on the effectiveness of a vaccine against Covid-19. On the basis of the many different PCR tests of highly varying quality, neither the risk of disease nor a possible vaccine benefit can be determined with the necessary certainty, which is why testing the vaccine on humans is unethical per se.
Furthermore, they demand that it must be excluded, e.g. by means of animal experiments, that risks already known from previous studies, which partly originate from the nature of the corona viruses, can be realized. The concerns are directed in particular to the following points:
The formation of so-called “non-neutralizing antibodies” can lead to an exaggerated immune reaction, especially when the test person is confronted with the real, “wild” virus after vaccination. This so-called antibody-dependent amplification, ADE, has long been known from experiments with corona vaccines in cats, for example. In the course of these studies all cats that initially tolerated the vaccination well died after catching the wild virus.
The vaccinations are expected to produce antibodies against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. However, spike proteins also contain syncytin-homologous proteins, which are essential for the formation of the placenta in mammals such as humans. It must be absolutely ruled out that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could trigger an immune reaction against syncytin-1, as otherwise infertility of indefinite duration could result in vaccinated women.
The mRNA vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer contain polyethylene glycol (PEG). 70% of people develop antibodies against this substance – this means that many people can develop allergic, potentially fatal reactions to the vaccination.
The much too short duration of the study does not allow a realistic estimation of the late effects. As in the narcolepsy cases after the swine flu vaccination, millions of healthy people would be exposed to an unacceptable risk if an emergency approval were to be granted and the possibility of observing the late effects of the vaccination were to follow. Nevertheless, BioNTech/Pfizer apparently submitted an application for emergency approval on December 1, 2020.
CALL FOR HELP: Dr. Wodarg and Dr. Yeadon ask as many EU citizens as possible to co-sign their petition by sending the e-mail prepared here to the EMA.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_182265,"13th Circuit Court Judge Kevin Elsenheimer released the bombshell audit report
A Michigan judge has released the bombshell report on the audit of Dominion Voting Systems, revealing that the machines and their software were ""designed"" to ""create systemic fraud.""The report covers the forensic audit of Dominion's machines in Michigan’s Antrim County — which received national attention after it was discovered that 6,000 votes for President Donald Trump were ""flipped"" to Democrat Joe Biden due to an ""error.""13th Circuit Court Judge Kevin Elsenheimer ordered the report's protective order to be lifted on Monday night, allowing the details of the audit to be unsealed and released to the public. The data firm that conducted the forensic audit of Dominion Voting Systems determined that the machines and software in Michigan showed that they were designed to create fraud and influence election results, the report reveals.
""We conclude that the Dominion Voting System is intentionally and purposefully designed with inherent errors to create systemic fraud and influence election results,” Russell Ramsland Jr., co-founder of Allied Security Operations Group, said in a preliminary report.
""The system intentionally generates an enormously high number of ballot errors.
""The ruling is a major blow for Dominion's CEOs (pictured) who hoped to keep the report sealed
""The electronic ballots are then transferred for adjudication,"" the report continues
""The intentional errors lead to bulk adjudication of ballots with no oversight, no transparency, and no audit trail.
""This leads to voter or election fraud,"" Ramsland Jr. explains.
""Based on our study, we conclude that The Dominion Voting System should not be used in Michigan,” he added.
""We further conclude that the results of Antrim County should not have been certified.""
Ramsland, a former Reagan administration official who has worked for NASA, and the team of cybersecurity experts examined Dominion products in Antrim County earlier this month as part of an ongoing case.The team inspected and performed forensic duplication on the county’s election management server, which was running Dominion Democracy Suite 5.5.3-002, compact flash cards used by local precincts in their Dominion ImageCast system, USB memory sticks used by Dominion Voter Assist Terminals, and USB memory sticks used for the poll book.They used X-Ways Forensics and other tools including Blackbag-Blacklight Forensic Software, and Virtual Box.
Judge Elsenheimer approved the forensic examination in Bailey v. Antrim County, which alleges the infamous vote flip county officials reported last month may have not been the result of human error, as officials had alleged.Antrim County resident William Bailey filed the lawsuit against the county that challenges the integrity of the election equipment.On Monday, Elsenheimer ruled that the report on the examination must be published.Elsenheimer unsealed the report after state and county officials withdrew their objections.
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, has attempted to dismiss the report as “inaccurate, incomplete, and misleading.”
“The Antrim County Clerk and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson have stated that the election night error detailed above by the vote ‘flip’ from Trump to Biden, was the result of human error caused by the failure to update the Mancelona Township tabulator prior to Election Night for a down-ballot race,” reads the report by Allied Security Operations Group.
“We disagree and conclude that the vote flip occurred because of machine error built into the voting software designed to create error.”
Allied Security Operations Group concludes that the Dominion system “should not be used in Michigan” and the Antrim County results “should not have been certified.”Last weekend, Judge Eisenheimer ordered Antrim County election officials to preserve all election materials and refrain from operating any of the county’s Dominion Voting Systems machines ahead of a forensic audit by the Trump campaign.
“Antrim County election officials discovered that ‘human error’ flipped 6,000 votes from Trump to Biden after Bailey alerted them to some inconsistencies in the county’s reporting of the vote,” The Daily Wire noted earlier this month.
Michigan Secretary of State Benson’s office attempted to dismiss the inconsistencies as ""human error.""
In a statement, Benson's office said that ""the clerk accidentally did not update the software used to collect voting machine data and report unofficial results.”
“The erroneous reporting of unofficial results from Antrim county was a result of accidental error on the part of the Antrim County Clerk,” the statement said.
“The equipment and software did not malfunction and all ballots were properly tabulated.
""However, the clerk accidentally did not update the software used to collect voting machine data and report unofficial results.”
Assistant Attorney General Erik Grill claims the audit analysis is “inaccurate, incomplete and misleading,” The Detroit Free Press reported Monday.
“There’s no reason to hide,” Grill said. “There is nothing to hide.”
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, attempted to dismiss the report as 'inaccurate, incomplete, and misleading'
Benson withdrew her objection to releasing the report, said Grill, because the attorney representing Bailey had given interviews to the press in which he leveled allegations about the election results and Benson, according to The Daily Wire.
“Any attempt to suppress the report now would only incorrectly be seen as an attempted coverup, he said,” the Free Press reports.
“Dominion Voting Systems and the Michigan Secretary of State’s Office continue to urge caution about false information related to Antrim County,” The Detroit News notes.Dominion said in a statement released Monday that the error was caused when officials did not update the programming, emphasizing that the error was caught in the post-election canvass process.
“The post-election canvass process is designed to catch errors, which is exactly where these errors were discovered,” the company said.
“It is disappointing, though not surprising, that the primary goal of this group is to continue spreading false information designed to erode the public’s confidence in the election,” said Jake Rollow, spokesman for Benson.
Trump won Antrim County by about 4,000 votes but lost the state by around 154,000 votes."

People must begin to realize that the America that has provided opportunities to millions, regardless of their race, gender, or orientation, is disappearing before our eyes.

Pelosi said she wanted “battle ready” reinforcements because “radicalized Trump supporters and kooky Qanon conspiracy people” were about to converge on D.C.

“I answer only to the president, and as I understand it, Donald J. Trump is still president and commander-in-chief. I abide in the Constitution as it was written, not your interpretation of it,” Gen. Berger admonished Pelosi.
Quoting our source, “When her intimidation tactic failed to sway Gen. Berger, Pelosi tried a different tactic: Begging and flattery.”
Pelosi claimed that the National Guard’s “weekend warriors” were ill-prepared to repel an army of “mad Trumpists.” Battle-hardened marines, however, were more capable of defeating “rabble rousers,” she said. “You have the best trained soldiers in the world, and America needs them.”
Gen. Berger was unmoved. The only way Marines would be deployed, he told her, was if President Trump himself issued that order.
“If you want us to help combat his supporters, I suggest you get him on the phone and tell him that. If he orders me to, I will. Otherwise, I suggest you listen really hard to the words escaping your cracked, poisonous lips; they’re tantamount to treason. We don’t work for you,” Gen. Berger allegedly told her."

this has happened [Again, I will get back to it]. 3.) Many of us assumed when Trump and those in his administration were referring to the next administration it meant the military. We expected him to step down (to remain neutral as Q said while all this went down. Trump did say that the next
administration would take over at noon today Like many, I thought this was over when Biden was sworn in as he now became the CiC. Boy, was I wrong. Because of the fraud (as pointed out), if the military has the proof of it then they have a duty under military code to remove the false government and restore a new legal civilian government under military code 11.3 which triggered when Biden was sworn in today (Q#26; when
11.3 verifies as 1st marker). There was a fear in the McCarthy era that the communists could take over our government, so provisions were put in place for the military to protect us should that happen. These provisions allow the military to take control while they remove the belligerent government and restore a legal civilian government (with the military running the elections to do that). Literally, the military was put in place as the last line of defense of the Constitution
should an illegal government be installed. This is why they didn't send a government plane for the President-Elect - because they know he is not a legitimate President and, once he was sworn in, the government became illegitimate (belligerent) and the military is now responsible for restoring legitimate civilian government (otherwise foreign
powers will gain control - see #1 above). Q said the end wouldn't be for everybody. We have been told by Trump. Flynn and other that America would soon get a lesson in the Constitution. Well folks, effective at noon today, when Biden illegally swore in with assistance of foreign nations he just made the government illegitimate and effectively put the military in
control. So, while like many, I thought it was over when Biden was sw in today, I realized O told us it NEEDED to happen for the mill V to assume control without it being a military coup (Q said it all

Family doctor and former Minnesota State Senator Scott Jensen made waves last year when he was one of the first in his field to speak out about the number of #Covid19 deaths thought to be inflated by the CDC’s irregular, and loose, guidelines on diagnosing death from Covid. Now, as the number of deaths has surpassed 400,000 in the US, Dr. Jensen and lawmakers are calling for an audit of these deaths.
in the US they get $12,000 to $13,000 for patients admitted and testing positive for a COVID-19 diagnoses and another $39,000 again give or take, for those put on ventilators. Those number vary a bit from report to report.
If they have 161 covid patients, they get an extra $70,000 per patient. That one I just found out about via the video. Thank you Dr. Jensen. There should be an audit of deaths world wide, as death certificates were also changed in other countries as well. In the UK for example if you died 28 days after testing positive, you were counted as a covid death.

Las Vegas Schools Forced To Reopen Amid Rash Of Student Suicides 
Tyler Durden's Photoby Tyler DurdenTuesday, Jan 26, 2021 – 17:45
A surge of student suicides across Las Vegas has pushed the Clark County School District to reopen schools as soon as possible, according to NYTimes. 
By December, eighteen students in the district had taken their own lives; an early-warning mental health system embedded within computers and tablets issued to students for remote learning received 3,100 alerts since schools shuttered their doors last March. 
“When we started to see the uptick in children taking their lives, we knew it wasn’t just the Covid numbers we need to look at anymore,” said Jesus Jara, the Clark County superintendent.
“We have to find a way to put our hands on our kids, to see them, to look at them. They’ve got to start seeing some movement, some hope,” Jara said. 
Efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 across the country have led to drastic changes in the way children and teens learn and socialize. 
Government data show a 24% increase in the number of children who arrived in emergency departments with mental health issues from mid-March through mid-October, compared with the same period in 2019. 
Countrywide, tens of millions of students have been thrown into a new distance learning environment that has resulted in many extracurricular activities being canceled. Recreational spaces have closed, sports canceled, and playdates shifted to Zoom calls, resulting in many kids developing mental issues, especially in Clark County. 
Clark County administrators had GoGuardian Beacon alert system installed on every device given out to students after the sixth student suicide last year. The system alerted administrators of more than 3,100 cases where a student searched suicide-related material between June and October.
In one instance, a 12-year boy searched “how to make a noose” on his iPad.” Administrators quickly reached out to the boy’s parents as he was about to hang himself. 
The alerts have been so disturbing to Jara that he doesn’t sleep near his phone anymore. 
“I can’t get these alerts anymore,” said Jara. “I have no words to say to these families anymore. I believe in God, but I can’t help but wonder: Am I doing everything possible to open our schools?”
Dr. Anthony Fauci has called for schools on a countrywide basis to reopen safely. 
An indirect consequence of the pandemic and forcing children to learn at home has contributed to a rise of mental health issues and suicides among America’s future generation.  Source

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_851025,"Fascbook is doubling down.

Since the violence at the Capitol our dear leader, the almighty Zuck, has sought out to silence dissent against his comrades in the Democrat party.  While, of course, Fascbook is free to do as they please as a private company, somehow claiming to be a free and open forum at the same time is a bit disingenuous. Their actions continue to threaten the free exercise of speech by individuals and by the press, as numerous personal accounts have been suspended for alleged “hate speech” and seemingly innocuous articles posted by news organizations on only one side of the aisle (guess which side) are now being flagged by Fascbook’s “fact checkers” as false, or for other vague violations.


Now, in a *shocking* ( and by “shocking” I mean completely predictable) turn of events, the Fascbook Ad Nazis have said to the movement to recall the oh-incompetent-one, Gavin Newsom, “No ads for you!”

According to Carl DeMaio, the chairman for Reform California, a group currently circulating petitions to recall Newsom, Facebook notified them that they will no longer accept the placement of ads to recall Mr. French Laundry. Over the last couple of weeks there has been a concerted effort from the violent and militant left to tie all conservative organizations to the violence which struck the Capitol. To be clear, what happened at the Capitol was violent, unnecessary, and completely out of line, and anyone who participated in that action should be charged and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. That being said, attempting to tie non-violent people and movements to the actions of a violent few is equally deplorable. Leave it to the San Diego Democrats, led by Mr. Lorena Gonzalez, to falsely attempt to tie the efforts to throw the bum in Sacramento to the curb to what happened at the Capitol. As if that wasn’t bad enough, the Leftist Agenda Times (the L.A. Times) published an article recently attempting to tie the Recall efforts to violence at the Capitol.


Of course, political violence of any kind should be abhorred. But it seems that the left accepts and loves violence and destruction as long as it is the means to forward their agenda or to take out Orange Man Bad. Facebook likely hasn’t de-platformed or ad-banned BLM, Antifa, or any other groups responsible for illegal violent acts, including the murder of dozens and the destruction of tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars of property during 2020, yet they ad-ban a group promoting a fully legal recall effort – a tool explicitly provided for in the California Constitution as a way for voters to make their voices heard directly. The blatant double standard is, of course, their right, but it is also outright fascist, full stop.

There have been no threats of violence or unrest made by the Reform California organization, nor any other efforts by the group to encourage violence or disseminate misinformation that could inspire such violence. That, of course, doesn’t stop Fascbook.

Reform California has taken the steps to appeal the decision made by Fascbook, but no final decision on ad-placement has been made by Facebook at the time of printing this article."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_659095,"On Tuesday morning, January 26, at approximately 3:00 am, a sniper’s bullet struck a panoramic casement window on the east wall of Trump’s bedroom at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The round might have slain Trump had he not recently replaced tempered glass with Blast Structures International’s bullet resistant glass, which, according to the company’s website, can stop anything less powerful than a .50 round.
A confidential source within Trump’s inner circle told Real Raw News that Trump was asleep in bed, and, a light sleeper, was awakened by the “sharp crack” of the bullet striking glass. The round did not penetrate the glass, but caused a material-science dissipation fracture, or spiderweb pattern.
The strike, our source said, triggered a silent alarm that instantly notified the Palm Beach Police Dept. and Trump’s Secret Service Detail, which sleeps in a guest house ten yards from the main building. Agents whisked Trump to safety, escorting him to a fortified saferoom, and said they’d coordinate with local authorities.
But Trump demanded they call the Palm Beach Police Dept. and say it was a false alarm.
“Trump was adamant no police get involved,” our source said. “He told his guys he wants to keep it in the family. No law enforcement. No media. He was very stern about keeping the media blind to the event. Trump made a phone call, and inside of thirty minutes, some heavy-hitting dudes who were definitely not Secret Service arrived at the estate,” our source said.
With Trump safe, his private security fanned across the 20-acre estate searching for signs of intrusion, while the Secret Service detail began its own investigation as to how a would-be assassin got within shooting distance of one of the most secure residences in the world.
At 7:00am a forensic ballistic expert from Quantico arrived at Mar-a-Lago and determined the bullet fragments were from a 7mm Remington Magnum round. He found himself amid an intractable dilemma, our source said. The round had been fired at a downward angle and, had it pierced glass, would have sizzled through Trump’s skull, but an attack on the east window meant one of two things. The sniper had taken the shot from either estate grounds, which lacks elevated terrain, or from somewhere above the Atlantic swell, a seemingly impossible feat.
“Trump’s bedroom is 23 feet above ground level. Besides the main building, no structure on the property is higher. The ballistics guy figured the shot could only have been made by someone in a hovering helicopter two hundred yards or more off the coast. If true, that guy must have been the best marksman in the world. From a helicopter and at night. Crazy,” our source said.
The concept of sniping from a helicopter seemed so unrealistic that RRL reached out to Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Hunter Bernius, a scout-sniper and instructor at the Marine Corps. School of Infantry in Geiger, North Carolina. Without mentioning the nature of our inquiry, we asked Staff Sgt. Bernius about the odds of successfully pulling off a 200-400 yard shot from a hovering chopper with little or no natural light.
“Only with proper training specifically for that type of mission. To shoot precisely, the shooter has to account for aircraft vibration and wind speed and direction, all wind whipping up around him from blades spinning at 400rpm. Then there’s a dozen other variables. Takes months and months of training from a qualified instructor, and there’s still no guarantee. Aerial sniping is a skill all its own,” Staff Sgt. Bernius said.
By noon, the Secret Service had discretely interviewed all persons on estate property, but no one reported having seen or heard a helicopter.
According to our source, Trump’s people suspected the attack was carried out by the Deep State, to stop Trump from amassing incriminating evidence that, if released, could sink every Democrat from Joe Biden to the most junior member of the Democratic caucus.
(For those people asking What about Melania? Where was Melania? Anyone who knows anything about the Trumps, knows they sleep in separate bedrooms.)

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_114601,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stands accused of violating federal law by inflating Coronavirus fatality numbers, according to stunning information obtained by NATIONAL FILE.
CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. The study, “COVID-19 Data Collection, Comorbidity & Federal Law: A Historical Retrospective,” was authored by Henry Ealy, Michael McEvoy, Daniel Chong, John Nowicki , Monica Sava, Sandeep Gupta, David White, James Jordan , Daniel Simon, and Paul Anderson. (READ THE LANDMARK RESEARCH HERE)
The CDC is now legally requiring red-blooded Americans to wear face masks on all public transportation as globalists try to push the concept of “double-masking” on the populace. Since the election, the World Health Organization admits that PCR tests are not totally reliable on the first try and a second test might be needed. This corresponds with CDC’s quiet admission that it blended viral and antibody test results for its case numbers and that people can test positive on an antibody test if they have antibodies from a family of viruses that cause the common cold. Hospitals in Florida had so many accuracy complications that Orlando Health had to admit that its 9.4 percent positivity rate got recorded at 98 percent. (READ: The TRUTH About Fauci and Gates And NIH Owning A Stake in the Vaccine).
“The groundbreaking peer-reviewed research…asserts that the CDC willfully violated multiple federal laws including the Information Quality Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Administrative Procedures Act at minimum. (Publishing Journal – Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge / Public Health Policy Initiative) Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,” the watchdog group All Concerned Citizens declared in a statement provided to NATIONAL FILE, referring to the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge study.
“The research demonstrates that the CDC failed to apply for mandatory federal oversight and failed to open a mandatory period for public scientific comment in both instances as is required by federal law before enacting new rules for data collection and reporting. The CDC is required to be in full compliance with all federal laws even during emergency situations. The research asserts that CDC willfully compromised the accuracy and integrity of all COVID-19 case and fatality data from the onset of this crisis in order to fraudulently inflate case and fatality data,” stated All Concerned Citizens.
“On March 24th the CDC published the NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 document instructing medical examiners, coroners and physicians to deemphasize underlying causes of death, also referred to as pre-existing conditions or comorbidities, by recording them in Part II rather than Part I of death certificates as “…the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause of death more often than not.” This was a major rule change for death certificate reporting from the CDC’s 2003 Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting and Physicians’ Handbook on Medical Certification of Death, which have instructed death reporting professionals nationwide to report underlying conditions in Part I for the previous 17 years. This single change resulted in a significant inflation of COVID-19 fatalities by instructing that COVID-19 be listed in Part I of death certificates as a definitive cause of death regardless of confirmatory evidence, rather than listed in Part II as a contributor to death in the presence of pre-existing conditions, as would have been done using the 2003 guidelines. The research draws attention to this key distinction as it has led to a significant inflation in COVID fatality totals. By the researcher’s estimates, COVID-19 recorded fatalities are inflated nationwide by as much as 1600% above what they would be had the CDC used the 2003 handbooks,” stated All Concerned Citizens.
“Then on April 14th, the CDC adopted additional rules exclusive for COVID-19 in violation of federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), a non-profit entity, again without applying for oversight and opening opportunity for public scientific review. On April 5th the CSTE published a position paper Standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) listing 5 CDC employees as subject matter experts. This key document created new rules for counting probable cases as actual cases without definitive proof of infection (section VII.A1 – pages 4 & 5), new rules for contact tracing allowing contact tracers to practice medicine without a license (section VII.A3 – page 5), and yet refused to define new rules for ensuring that the same person could not be counted multiple times as a new case (section VII.B – page 7),” stated All Concerned Citizens.
“By enacting these new rules exclusively for COVID-19 in violation of federal law, the research alleges that the CDC significantly inflated data that has been used by elected officials and public health officials, in conjunction with unproven projection models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), to justify extended closures for schools, places of worship, entertainment, and small businesses leading to unprecedented emotional and economic hardships nationwide. A formal petition has been sent to the Department of Justice as well as all US Attorneys seeking an immediate grand jury investigation into these allegations,” All Concerned Citizens stated.

NATIONAL FILE reported: National Institutes of Health (NIH) own a financial stake in the Bill Gates-funded Moderna Coronavirus vaccine, raising big questions about the supposed impartiality of the federal government’s policy decisions during the Coronavirus outbreak. NIAID director Dr. Anthony Fauci, a financial ally of Bill Gates whose institute is part of NIH, has been critical of Hydroxychloroquine and the FBI even raided a health spa serving intravenous vitamin C, which are competitors to a vaccine. (RELATED: Eight NIH Coronavirus Panel Experts Disclose Financial Relationships With Price-Hiking Drugmaker Gilead).
“We do have some particular stake in the intellectual property” for the Moderna vaccine stated Francis Collins, the director of NIH, in a revelatory recent Economic Club panel discussion. “One of the vaccines– the one that’s furthest along– what started, actually, at the federal government in our own Vaccine Research Center at NIH– then worked with a biotechnology company called Moderna to get to where we are now, with very impressive Phase I results and getting ready to go into a large-scale trial as early as July. That one, of course, we do have some particular stake in the intellectual property. Others, though, come from companies who’ve invested their efforts into getting them to the point where they might now be ready for a trial,” Collins stated.
Newly published documents from Public Citizen have massive implications. Public Citizen states:
“The U.S. government may jointly own a potential coronavirus vaccine. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has played a critical role in coronavirus research for years. Building off this work, federal scientists have helped design and test mRNA-1273—a vaccine candidate developed in partnership with Moderna.[2] The federal government has filed multiple patents covering mRNA-1273. In this report, we describe two patent applications that list federal scientists as co-inventors.[3] If the government successfully pursued its patent filings, the resulting patents would likely confer significant rights. We also review recently disclosed contracts between NIH and Moderna. The agreements suggest that NIH has not transferred its rights, but instead maintains a joint stake.”

HERE’S THE REAL STORY OF CONTACT TRACING
Some Republicans are voicing concern after Texas state health officials granted a $295 million Coronavirus Contact Tracing deal to MTX Group, a firm run by a man named Das Nobel, which faces criticism for previous work it did for the state of Kentucky. It turns out the firm is a partner of Google, NATIONAL FILE has learned. MTX Group got the contract without conservative Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick being “in the loop” to the decision process, and Patrick is just one of numerous policymakers questioning the company’s deal with the state, which authorizes MTX to serve as virus investigators charting people’s contacts and relationships. MTX has also partnered during the Coronavirus outbreak with New York State and built Contact Tracing technology employed in Georgia. So what’s really going on here? It turns out MTX is bigtime partners with Google:

I reported: Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) policy confirms that “Contact Tracing” data may be sent to the World Health Organization (WHO) and to law enforcement authorities “to place someone under quarantine or isolation.” The Contact Tracing records, stored at the CDC and elsewhere, can also be sent to the Department of Justice, State Department, Department of Homeland Security, congressional offices, and to various medical and legal departments and contractors. Democrats are currently seeking $100 billion in a bill that would authorize grants to conduct contact tracing at people’s homes. Meanwhile, Americans are fearing the political implications of contact tracing, considering that Chelsea Clinton is on the board of trustees of one official contact tracing group that has accepted large sums of money from Bill Gates and George Soros organizations.
HHS records show a System of Records Notice (SORN 09-20-0171) in the Federal Register marking the creation of the record system called “Quarantine- and Traveler-Related Activities, Including Records for Contact Tracing Investigation and Notification…” The records pertain to “Individuals subject to quarantine or isolation orders, ill travelers (i.e., passengers and crew), contacts of ill travelers, and/or individuals exposed or suspected of being exposed to serious communicable diseases.” The records include: “Passenger and crew manifests from conveyances carrying individuals subject to 42 CFR parts 70 and 71, case reports, illness response forms, medical assessments, medical records (including but not limited to clinical, hospital and laboratory data and data from other relevant tests), name, address, date of birth, and related information and documents collected for the purpose of carrying out agency responsibilities under sections 311 and 361-368 of the Public Health Services Act.” The records are being stored at: “Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National Center for the Preparedness, Detection, and Control of Infectious Disease (NCPDCID), Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, NE., Building 16; MS E03, Atlanta, GA 30333. Records may occasionally be stored at Quarantine Stations located at key ports of entry and at contractor sites.”

Officials with Broward County Department of Health and the Florida Surgeon General’s Office have created a process to force-quarantine people who have not even tested positive for Coronavirus, according to a memo from inside the Broward County Department of Health obtained by NATIONAL FILE after a source filed a public information request. The March 27 memo written by Joshua D. Lenchus, shortly before he was named chief medical officer this month of Broward Health Medical Center, confirms that the process allows for a “Quarantine Order” to be issued for “Persons Under Investigation” who have not even tested positive. This scoop comes amid public outcry after we exposed Broward County Administrator Bertha Henry caught on tape discussing going into “family homes” and assisted living facilities to isolate people during the Coronavirus outbreak. Freedom protesters wielding petitions were shut out of the Broward Commissioners meeting on Tuesday.

Broward County Administrator Discussing Removing People From Family Homes for COVID-19 Quarantines


HERE IS THE MEMO ISSUED BY JOSHUA LENCHUS: browardorder
SOROS, GATES, AND CLINTONS
Partners in Health was recently selected by Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker to conduct Coronavirus “contact tracing,” a process that involves teams of investigators finding out who infected people have come into contact with. The group is already “training and deploying hundreds of contact tracers.” Some citizens fear the potential for mass surveillance posed by contact tracing, especially in light of a Democrat-introduced bill in Congress to authorize contact tracing “at individuals’ residences.” Partners In Health’s involvement will not assuage many fears, considering the group has received funding from George Soros and Bill Gates organizations and counts Chelsea Clinton on its board of trustees.
Partners in Health lists George Soros’ Open Society Foundations as an official partner, along with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Partners In Health lists Open Society Foundations on its 2015 annual report as a supporter to the tune of $1 million or above, along with the Gates Foundation. Chelsea Clinton serves on Partners in Health’s Board of Trustees, according to its 2019 annual report. 
Partners in Health co-founder Paul Farmer’s achievement.org bio notes: “Farmer’s work attracted the support of philanthropists, including George Soros and Bill and Melinda Gates. In 2002, PIH received a $13 million grant from the Global Fund for improvements in the Cange complex. In 2005 the William J. Clinton Foundation funded a Partners in Health AIDS program in Rwanda.” Farmer and Chelsea Clinton did a Clinton Foundation podcast together in 2019.
In response to a 2007 tuberculosis outbreak in Africa, NBC News reported: “Soros’ Open Society Institute announced a $3 million grant to the non-profit organization Partners in Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. The donation will be used to design a model project of community-based XDR-TB treatment in Lesotho. Once treatment guidelines are developed, experts hope the program will be adopted in other poor countries.”
Soros personally announced the grant and said he hoped it would spark a larger project. For this initiative, Partners In Health was cited by name in the propaganda book The Philanthropy of George Soros: Building Open Societies.
In 2011, International Women’s Health Coalition noted, “YP Foundation Founder to Join Paul Farmer, George Soros, at IWHC Gala.” Farmer was honored at the gala, which Guest of a Guest noted had David Rockefeller in attendance.
In 2014, Partners In Health co-founder Paul Farmer secured multi-million dollar Soros financing for a coalition project in Africa. Farmer was featured in an October 2014 video interview on Soros’ Open Society Foundations website, which stated, “In between trips to Liberia, Paul Farmer of Partners In Health visited Open Society’s offices to discuss his work on Ebola. Paul talked about the need to ensure sustainable health systems for people in nations where the virus has spread.” Farmer blasted “fear and conspiracy theories around fatal illnesses” in the video and talked about how to “attack” conspiracy theories with activism.

Why Ebola Needs a Community Response


Forbes reported in September 2014: “There’s never been a connection between Ebola and first-rate medical care,” says Paul Farmer, the renowned co-founder of Partners in Health, before pointing out that none of the health care workers flown back to the U.S. for treatment have died. Could the answer to the outbreak lie in the care regiment for those afflicted?
We’ll soon find out. Farmer landed in Liberia this morning, at the center of a coalition quietly formed to specifically – and quickly – test that thesis. In the next few weeks, the Farmer group will open a top-notch treatment facility in one of Liberia’s most rural provinces, along with strategies designed to maximize its effectiveness.
“This has been coming together for years,” Farmer tells Forbes, a few hours before departing on the trip. “The Ebola crisis pushed it over the edge.”
The impetus for this coalition began with a meeting two weeks ago, convened by Farmer’s co-founder at Partners in Health, Jim Kim, who is now president of the World Bank. Attendees included Director-General Margaret Chan of the World Health Organization, Tom Frieden, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Francis Collins, Director of the National Institute for Health. Dismayed by the global response – Kim told the group that the outbreak already ranks among the worst health crises in world history — Kim tabbed Farmer as the World Bank’s special Ebola advisor and also enlisted another attendee at the meeting, Raj Panjabi, who runs Last Mile Health in Liberia. (Full disclosure: Panjabi was mentored at last year’s Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy and I now chair the advisory board for Last Mile Health, which hires, trains and manages front-line health care workers in remote villages.)
George Soros’ Open Society Foundations quickly provided $4 million to fund this project. “The coalition got us a proposal the next day, they answered all our questions the day after, and we got them the funds they needed before the week was out,” says Chris Stone, the organization’s president. The project was appealing to Soros’ team because it features a local group familiar with the turf, an entrepreneurial mentality and the ability to scale.”

Contact Tracers Exposed https://t.co/vv5pUJXyOo

Meanwhile…
Prospective Coronavirus contact tracers in New York City are required to understand “institutional and structural racism” and to support immigrants and the LGBTQ community. The government is employing contact tracers to investigate who infected persons come into contact with, leading to civilian concerns that privacy is being attacked. (RELATED: Democrats Introduce Bill To Authorize Contact Tracing At People’s Homes).
A job posting on Columbia University School of General Studies states: “The Fund for Public Health in New York City (FPHNYC), in partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), is seeking contact tracers to perform case interviews and contact tracing to support the citywide COVID-19 response. using a trauma-informed, culturally respectful approach that builds trust and facilitates the free sharing of information.” The job includes “Conducting in-person investigations into congregate settings and selected cases and contacts.”
Listed requirements include: “Ability to understand the concepts of institutional and structural racism and bias and their impact on underserved and underrepresented communities” and “Have a demonstrated commitment to supporting communities who have experienced systemic oppression and bias (e.g. people of color, LGBTQ people, immigrants, justice involved persons, etc.)”
Democrat Rep. Bobby Rush has introduced a bill in Congress to authorize the federal government to grant approved entities the right to conduct contact tracing for Coronavirus at “individuals’ residences.” Contact tracing involves investigators tracing every interaction that infected people have.
Rep. Rush introduced HR 6666, “COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act” on May 1, 2020 and it has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The bill has 45 co-sponsors. According to the text of the bill: “To authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals’ residences, and for other purposes.”
People are concerned that the government might be angling to use contact tracing to remove people from their homes and place them in quarantine, after a Ventura County, California health official suggested doing just that (and later walked it back, though it’s unclear what his proposed policy actually is at this time).

CHILDREN AT RISK
Child Protective Services (CPS) agencies are facing national scrutiny as Salem, Oregon salon owner Lindsey Graham accuses CPS of questioning her children in a politically motivated targeting operation. Graham is fighting Democrat governor Kate Brown’s state government in an effort to re-open her business during the government-imposed Coronavirus lockdown. Graham’s crusade, predictably, is making her a target of the political establishment.

Salem salon owner fined $14K for violating Gov. Brown's order


I led the way in exposing Child Protective Services with my 2019 investigative journalism series. I spotlighted the massive problems in Oregon, interviewing pro-life activist Heather Hobbs regarding her claim that a nurse targeted her with a vindictive CPS report in the hospital due to her pro-life conservative beliefs, and I showed how the Oregon Treasury invested in a foster care provider accused of lording over patient abuse.
Meanwhile: Washington state’s Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCFY, also known as “CPS” for “Child Protective Services”) posted a job listing for existing CPS workers to volunteer to supervise children in quarantine centers during the Coronavirus outbreak.
The job posting states: “DCYF is seeking current DCYF employees in King, Snohomish, and Benton counties to volunteer to supervise and support children and youth in Emergency Quarantine Centers. While this is a voluntary effort, you will be compensated four ranges (approximately 20%) above you current base salary while performing these duties, and return to your normal position and salary once concluded. We are looking for current DCYF Social Service Specialist 3’s to care for children who are either COVID-19 positive, or who may have been exposed to COVID-19. There are three locations…”
One of the listed locations, Cedar Springs Camp, clarified that they were falsely listed by the state of Washington as a quarantine center, and they asked the state to remove them. The job posting closed on May 11.
Responding to social media uproar, the Washington state’s DCYF put out a clarifying statement that the ad was only referring to children currently in the system. But their clarifying statement contradicts itself, at first stating that the quarantined children will be kids who have tested positive, and then stating that quarantined children will also be kids who may have been exposed to Coronavirus.
DCYF’s clarifying statement reads: “In light of some concerns from the public regarding two recent job postings by the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), the agency would like to clarify the intent of these job listings and address misinformation spreading as a result of the job description.
The job postings targeted current staff interested in Social Service Specialist 3 and Social Service Specialist 5 positions. The post prematurely included sites of potential locations in the community where we could house children in our legal care and authority who’ve tested positive for COVID-19 in the event that a placement home was not available. The facilities listed are not affiliated with DCYF and had not signed off on this job listing.
The listings have since been taken down to avoid further confusion.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, DCYF began internal recruitment of social service specialists to care for foster children who are either COVID-19 positive or may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the event a placement home was not available.
To clarify, those facilities that ultimately open their doors to this effort would only house State-dependent children and youth in out-of-home care who due to being COVID positive or COVID exposed do not currently have a foster home available. These facilities are for this limited scope and not considered quarantine centers or intended for the general public.”
Meanwhile…
Multiple mothers have had their children taken away from them as a direct result of working in the medical profession during the Coronavirus outbreak. Will these disturbing cases register with our political leaders, who are voicing public calls to stand with our medical workers during the pandemic?
Additionally, NATIONAL FILE caught a Child Protective Services worker attempting to use the Coronavirus outbreak to suspend all visits for parents of a child in the government system, citing a statewide policy that the state government says does not exist. What is going on?
(UPDATE: Dr. Theresa Greene, profiled below, got her children back after an appeals court ruling)
The Washington Examiner previously reported:
“A divorced emergency room physician temporarily lost custody of her daughter because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Dr. Theresa Greene, a doctor in South Florida, previously shared custody of her 4-year-old daughter with her ex-husband, Eric Greene, but a judge granted an emergency order granting him sole custody until the ordeal is over, according to NBC Miami.
In the court’s decision, Circuit Judge Bernard Shapiro wrote, “In order to protect the best interests of the minor child, including but not limited to the minor child’s safety and welfare, this Court temporarily suspends the Former Wife’s timesharing until further Order of Court. The suspension is solely related to the outbreak of COVID-19.”…
…Theresa Greene responded to the judge’s ruling by saying that “the family court system now is stressing me almost more than the virus.”
“I was just shocked that the judge would take this stance without talking to medical experts and knowing the facts and take it so lightly, take my child from me, and not think of the effect on her, her me"
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_909105,"China, the World Health Organization and the U.S. National Institutes of Health have dimissed the theory that the virus causing the global pandemic that has killed more than 2 million people and devastated economies worldwide escaped from the Wuhan, China, lab funded by the United States.
But there's no disputing the fact, as Newsweek reported in April 2020, that NIH executive Dr. Anthony Fauci promoted a highly controversial type of research involving the manipulation of viruses to explore their potential for infecting humans. And it's known that more than 200 scientists pressured the Obama administration in 2014 to temporarily halt U.S. funding for that research because of the risk of a manipulated virus accidentally escaping a lab and igniting a pandemic. Nevertheless, under Fauci's direction, the dangerous virus engineering resumed in 2017 and continued until April 2020.
Now, documentary evidence makes it a ""near certainty"" that the coronavirus pandemic originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, where so-called ""gain-of-function"" research was funded by Fauci's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, according to Steve Hilton, who is leading a special investigation for his Fox News show ""The Next Revolution.""
Significantly, his investigation found a direct link between a bat coronavirus discovered a decade ago in a mine in Yunnan province and one that had been engineered in the Wuhan lab, 1,000 miles away.
Hilton noted on his show Sunday night that scientists at the Wuhan lab published a paper in February 2020 stating they had recently discovered a virus in Yunnan province that ""showed high sequence identity"" to COVID-19.
However, Hilton discovered after running the virus's genome sequence through the NIH's GenBank database that only one virus was an exact match to COVID-19. It wasn't the virus discovered recently. It was the once discovered a decade ago in Yunnan province that killed miners who had stirred up bat feces.
Hilton found it curious that the Wuhan researchers not only didn't reveal that fact, they changed the name of the Yunnan virus, as indicated by GenBank.
As evidence that the Yunnan virus was manipulated in the Wuhan lab, Hilton pointed out that the two viruses are the same, except for two key elements: The COVID-19 virus is more infectious and can enter human cells in the respiratory system.
""Those are the exact places in the viral sequence where gain-of-function techniques would be applied, if ... you were funded by the NAID to research bat coronaviruses to explore emergences or spillover potential,"" he said.
""Spillover potential"" refers to the ability of a virus to jump from animals to humans.
That exact gain-of-function research, he pointed out, was touted in a Nov. 30, 2017, progress report tied to an NAID grant.
The crucial question, Hilton said, was whether the virus at the center of that U.S.-funded work was the one that was discovered in the mine a decade ago.
""The match between that virus and the work commissioned by NAID is so perfect, it's impossible to believe they weren't,"" he said.
He noted that workers in the Wuhan lab were the first identified cases of COVID-19 in the fall of 2019.
Implausible coincidences
The WHO and others are leaning toward a ""natural"" explanation for the pandemic, Hilton noted. But if the COVID-19 pandemic originated naturally in the Yunnan mine – as the genome sequence indicates – but had nothing to do with research at the Wuhan lab, you would ""have to believe in a laughably implausible set of coincidences."" The bats in Yunnan province would have had to infect each other and another unknown animal or a human and then travel 1,000 miles – without infecting anyone else – until they got to Wuhan.
Before any mutations, he argued, the virus was 10 to 20 times more infectious than any previously observed virus occuring in nature.
""And most incredibly of all,"" he added, ""the infected animal or human would have somehow chosen to make that 1,000-mile trek to the only place in all of China that had been working for years on the virus it was already infected with,"" the Wuhan lab.
Significantly, the Chinese regime has blocked access to the Wuhan lab. Last week, NBC News reported that a Wuhan Institute of Virology database with 20,000 entries was removed last spring for ""security reasons.""
But Hilton said the U.S. government also has not been forthcoming. After two weeks, the NIH finally responded last Friday to his request for comment on the coronavirus gain-of-function research project that began after the Obama administration's halt in funding.
The NIH replied that the project did not involve gain-of-function research. But Hilton noted that the project to which NIH referred was not the project he was asking about, which clearly was gain-of-function research.
Calling the response ""deceptive,"" he wanted to know whether or not the director of NIH, the famed scientist Francis Collins, was aware of the statement.
The Chinese regime can certainly be blamed for a cover-up allowing the outbreak to become a global pandemic, Hilton said. But the reason the virus exists and is so contagious, he asserted, can be traced back to the decision of Collins and Fauci to go ahead with the gain-of-function research as a ""risk worth taking"" after the Obama administration stopped the funding.
""Of course Dr. Collins or Dr. Fauci didn't create the pandemic on purpose. That is obviously ludicrous. They've dedicated their careers to fighting disease,"" Hilton said.
""But there's little doubt that one of their weapons of choice in that fight did lead to this pandemic.""
And they were warned that it could happen.
Finding the Achilles' heel
A Newsweek report in April 2020 confirmed that NAID funded scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and other institutions for work on gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses. In 2011, Fauci played an important role in promoting the work, arguing the research was worth the risk, because it could enable scientists to prepare treatments and vaccines in advance if a pandemic occurred, Newsweek said.
Fauci and two co-authors defended the work in the Washington Post in December 2011, arguing that ""determining the molecular Achilles' heel of these viruses can allow scientists to identify novel antiviral drug targets that could be used to prevent infection in those at risk or to better treat those who become infected.""
The work was halted by the Obama administration in 2014 under pressure from scientists but resumed in December 2017 when the NIH lifted the moratorium. Going forward, scientists had to get approval from a panel of experts who would determine whether or not the risks were justified.
The research was conducted in secret until, in early 2019, a reporter for Science magazine discovered that the NIH had approved two gain-of-function projects, drawing rebuke from scientists in an editorial in the Washington Post.
""We have serious doubts about whether these experiments should be conducted at all,"" wrote Tom Inglesby of Johns Hopkins University and Marc Lipsitch of Harvard. ""[W]ith deliberations kept behind closed doors, none of us will have the opportunity to understand how the government arrived at these decisions or to judge the rigor and integrity of that process.""
See Hilton's segment:
Wuhan lab the 'most likely' source
In April 2020, a U.S. government report concluded the Wuhan lab was the ""most likely"" source of COVID-19, finding other explanations ""highly unlikely.""
The report noted the activities of Shi Zhengli, a leader in bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan lab. A 2015 academic report in Nature Medicine by Shi and 14 other scientists said that while researching the potential for bat coronaviruses to infect humans, ""we built a chimeric virus encoding a novel, zoonotic (animal-origin) spike protein ... that was isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats.""
The U.S. government analysis, reported by the Washington Times, found virus-carrying animals had been ""sold as pets, dead laboratory animals were not properly disposed of, and lab workers were known to boil and eat laboratory-used eggs.""
The report noted that China was clamping down on efforts to investigate whether the virus came from a lab, issuing a ""gag order"" and putting a military microbiologist in charge of the Wuhan lab."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_396315,"Calling into question any aspect of November’s presidential election is a dangerous proposition these days.  One is liable to be banned from social media or blamed for a riot at the U.S. Capitol even for suggesting that there might be irregularities that warrant further investigation.

It is, however, far from conspiracy-mongering to accept the reality that those in charge of administering state elections here in Wisconsin put their thumb on the scales at every conceivable opportunity.  The Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) violated state law by refusing to remove 234,000 names from the voter rolls and by keeping both Kanye West and the Green Party off the ballot so that they could not serve as spoilers for eventual winner Joe Biden.

Milwaukee and Dane County clerks violated state law by telling voters that they could claim indefinite confinement (and thus avoid voter ID requirements) even if they themselves were not actually confined to their homes.  The City of Madison violated state law by holding a ballot harvesting event (for which the Biden campaign actually advertised) in every one of its city parks.

Now it seems likely that elections officials across the state refused to reject ballots that they normally would have (and probably legally should have).  The WEC’s newly released Election Data Report reveals a staggering anomaly that is nearly impossible to otherwise explain: Despite a massive increase in the use of mail-in voting this November, the percentage of ballots that were rejected dropped to nearly zero.

Just 4,270 absentee ballots out of 1,969,274 cast were rejected—a rate of 0.2%.  This defies both logic and common sense.  In November’s presidential election, there were roughly twice as many absentee ballots cast as in the spring 2016 election, yet in that election four years ago the rejection rate was 2.5%.  If far more people were casting absentee ballots (and presumably casting them for the first time), it would stand to reason that the number of mistakes which cause ballots to be rejected would increase as well.


Source: Wisconsin Elections Commission
Instead, those mistakes all but vanished.  An infinitesimal 0.07% of ballots (1,434 in total) were rejected because of insufficient ballot certification.  An even smaller 0.05% (1,045 total) were rejected because they were received after polls closed.  And a microscopic 0.002% (just 42 total) were rejected because the ballot envelope was somehow compromised.

This is nearly impossible to explain, especially since the ballot rejection rate was 1.8% just seven months earlier in Wisconsin’s spring election, when a then-record 1,101,474 absentee ballots were cast.  Despite a 78% increase in the number of absentee ballots cast in November, there was a 78% decrease in the number of ballots that were rejected.

Did hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites suddenly figure out how to correctly fill out their ballots? Or was there a concerted effort to count as many ballots as possible without regard to whether they were correctly filled out?

The evidence points toward the latter.  The ballot rejection rate in the April 2016 presidential primary was 2.5% with a 1.4% rejection rate the following November even though there were far fewer absentee ballots returned than in the 2020 presidential election cycle.  The April 2020 rejection rate was well within the normal range at 1.8%, but then it suddenly dipped to a minuscule 0.2%.

Interestingly enough, in the November 2018 gubernatorial election—which was also dogged by allegations of fraud following a sudden influx of absentee votes in Milwaukee that propelled Governor Tony Evers past Scott Walker—the absentee ballot rejection rate suddenly dropped to 0.2%.  What exactly would be the odds that ballots suddenly stopped getting rejected in the two statewide races in which unpopular Republicans (Walker and Donald Trump) were on the ballot and both lost because of huge increases in absentee voting?

Given that the Wisconsin Elections Commission has since 2016 been unlawfully telling local clerks to fix problematic ballots instead of returning them to voters as state statutes require, it seems as though it has been WEC policy (unlawful though it may be) to get as many questionable ballots counted as possible.  This, however, doesn’t explain the sudden and dramatic dips in ballot rejection rates only in the 2018 gubernatorial and 2020 presidential elections.

Either voters somehow figured out ballot return rules exceptionally well only in those two races or clerks and poll workers had a concerted effort to reject as few ballots as possible in an unlawful attempt at aiding Democrat challengers in their bid to unseat Republican incumbents whom the clerks and poll workers despised.

Either way, this stunningly low rejection rate with a record number of mail-in ballots demands and immediate and thorough investigation."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_700739,"On Tuesday, November 3rd President Trump was ahead of Joe Biden in the swing state of Michigan by over 100,000 votes.  This appeared to be another solid win for President Trump in Michigan with a greater margin than his 2016 victory. The ballot counting in Detroit, Michigan on election night took place at the TCF Center, formerly known as Cobo Hall.

This is the site where Detroit City Officials put cardboard over the windows to prevent the GOP observers from seeing in, where poll workers were militantly hostile to the GOP observers, and where hundreds of affidavits by election observers claim they witnessed voter fraud.

At least three election observers testified in sworn affidavits that they witnessed vehicles delivering fraudulent ballots to the TCF Center early in the morning on November 4th.

Michigander Shane Trejo witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop that gave Joe Biden an outstanding lift. “There were thousands of ballots in each box,” Trejo says. “There were at least 50 boxes that I saw unloaded at 3:30 am, well after the 8:00 pm deadline for ballots to show up.”

The 3:30 am was the first ballot delivery since 10:30 pm when 138,000 ballots showed up suddenly. Shane later testified that he noticed that the city of Detroit Clerk’s Office and its emblem were written on the white van that showed up with the ballots. City Clerk Janice Winfrey‘s name was on the van and a number presumably for Janet Winfrey’s office. Trejo says the ballots could not be processed when they arrived, so by the time they were counted, a new shift of poll workers had come in for the day.


After these ballot drops Joe Biden took the lead in Michigan.



Shane Trejo explained how the timing was important.  The Biden Ballot Drop took place at the end of one shift. The ballots were left uncounted. So when the new shift came to count ballots they didn’t know where the ballots had come from.

Trejo repeatedly asked about this truck to site supervisors and was STONEWALLED.

Former Michigan State Senator Pat Colbeck was also present at the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th. Senator Colbeck also witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop.  Colbeck spoke with The Gateway Pundit back in November, “I went back there and I witnessed a mini-panel truck if you will with a Detroit Election Bureau regalia all over the side and a vehicle ID number on it… And inside of it, and this gets into some chain of custody discussions, there was no indication that there was a Republican and a Democrat (present) during transfer. We don’t know if they stopped by a sidestreet in Coney Island and picked up a few more ballots during transfer. We have no way of verifying any of that information.”



The authorities and media in Michigan were completely uninterested in following up on this shocking story.

Until today, no one has bothered to review the video footage from the TCF Center on election night.

The Gateway Pundit requested the TCF video back in December!

The TCF Center tried to quote us over $22,000 for one day’s worth of video. 

We requested two hours of video.

Last Friday we were sent the requested video.

Since last week we have been combing through the hundreds of hours of security camera footage from the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th.

And what we found is a political bombshell.



** At 3:23 AM The Gateway Pundit has exclusive video of a white van registered to the city of Detroit entering the gate into the TCF Center.
** At 3:25 AM we discovered video from a second camera showing three individuals unloading over 50 boxes of ballots in a hallway inside the TCF Building and just outside the counting room.
** The ballots were then wheeled away on carts into the ballot counting room.
** The van is then seen on video leaving the center about 25 minutes later.
** Then we saw the van returning an hour later, entering the TCF Center again and unloading more boxes of ballots.
** The white van was escorted by a black sports car for both ballot deliveries.
** The white van was allowed through an electronic gate to enter the TCF complex.

This is video proof of the fraud in Detroit, Michigan. It is exactly as the GOP observers described it to us back in November!

We have more damning video from the TCF Center to release in the coming days.

Here is our video on the election fraud in the Detroit TCF Center on election night:

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_571371,"The claim often repeated by the mainstream media, social-media content moderators, and fact-checkers that lawsuits filed by President Donald Trump’s campaign and Republicans were universally dismissed by the courts is untrue, according to a new analysis.

The findings do not necessarily suggest that if the lawsuits had all been decided before Joe Biden was certified as the official winner of the presidential election by Congress on Jan. 7 that former President Trump would have won the hotly contested election.

Nor would they necessarily have affected many of the Electoral College votes won by Biden in the disputed battleground states. Some of the legal victories took place in states like Colorado and Iowa where the popular vote counts for the respective winners of those states –Biden in Colorado and Trump in Iowa— were not close.

Of the 22 cases that have been heard by the courts and decided on their merits, Trump and Republicans have prevailed in 15, according to citizen journalist John Droz Jr., a physicist and environmental advocate in Morehead City, N.C.

This means Trump has won two-thirds of the cases fully adjudicated by the courts.

Droz and a team of volunteers dug through court filings and legal minutiae to track down 81 lawsuits that were filed in connection with the Nov. 3, 2020 presidential election. The lawsuits were tracked on Droz’s publicly available spreadsheet that was current as of Feb. 6.

Of the 81 cases, 11 were withdrawn or consolidated and 23 were dismissed for lack of standing or on other grounds. Both the cohort of 11 and of 23 should not be considered “wins or losses for either side,” Droz says, because they “have nothing to do with the merits of the case.”

This leaves 47 cases. Of those 47, 22 have been finalized after the court heard arguments, considered evidence, and then issued a ruling.

Of those 22, Trump or Republicans won 15 and lost 7, according to the analysis.

This leaves 25 lawsuits that have yet to be finally disposed of.

This means Trump and Republicans “have WON the majority of 2020 election cases fully heard, and then decided on the merits!” Droz said in a statement. “Is that what the mainstream media is reporting?”

Among the legal victories for Republicans were:

RNC v. Miller, in the Iowa courts, a lawsuit in which the Republican National Committee won an injunction over absentee ballot applications.

RNC v. Gill, in the Iowa courts, in which the Trump campaign won an injunction preventing a county official from distributing and accepting signed forms containing preprinted information.

Trump for President v. Boockvar, in the Pennsylvania courts, in which the Trump campaign was granted an injunction against the counting of mail-in and absentee ballots where voters were allowed to provide proof of identity days after Election Day.

Droz noted that only three lawsuits addressed voting machine inaccuracies.

“One of these was dismissed (due to jurisdiction), one was ruled against (although no discovery was granted), and one is still open (discovery was granted).”

“The likely explanation for so few cases in these two areas is that legally proving fraud or voting machine manipulations are very time-consuming processes, that require substantial investigative work and documentation. There simply wasn’t enough time to do this prior to key points in the process (like the Electoral College).”

“Our view is that the public needs to be much better educated regarding the election integrity issue—and having a more accurate understanding of the lawsuit component is a key part of that,” Droz wrote, explaining the purpose of his report."
Politifact_FALSE_Social media_703960,Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_465227,"This is the nightmare some of us have been warning you about. You probably thought, for the last 3 or 4 months at least, that with highly effective vaccines in distribution, you might get your life back soon- maybe even by the summer of 2021. The masks would come off, schools and restaurants would all open, even weddings and concerts would be back in action.

Think again. The Lockdowners and mask cultists have other plans for you.

Now the media tells us with the pace of vaccinations and the spread of new strains, covid will be around for years, maybe even decades. It will become endemic, “like the flu.”



At a minimum, this means arbitrary, idiotic “mitigation” measures like mask mandates, filling out test and trace forms, and random temperature checks could become the new normal forever. And it will probably be far more intrusive and destructive than that.

One thing is for sure already: they’re going to drag out the pain, misery, and control as long as they can. Too many people have too much emotional investment in their “belief in science” (itself an absurd idea). It just feels so virtuous for MSNBC watchers to sneer at the evil anti-mask Trump supporters while working class people delivery their packages and food to them.

No, they aren’t in any rush to let you have your life back. Quite the opposite. They’ve conditioned much of the American pubic to become brainless sheep who do whatever bureaucrats with stethoscopes tell them, or at least what feckless politicians claim the experts say.

They’ve effectively created a turnkey totalitarian society. Do you really think they want to give all that power back before at least giving it a test drive for a year or two?

The Left loves to leverage a crisis, and this one lets them literally control your ability to breathe.

So they will find endless excuses to extend the Covid lockdown misery. You may have already figured this out, seeing as that totalitarian smurf in a lab coat Dr. Fauci has said that double masking is probably a good idea, until the virus is totally gone.

Actually, Fauci said two masks was logical, then he said there’s no science behind it, then Biden advisor Dr. Michael Osterholm said publicly two masks were worse than one, then Fauci said two masks can’t hurt, then he said they’re waiting on data from CDC to show whether two masks are in fact better (anyone wanna place bets on what that will say?). This all took place in about a week.

“Listen to the science!” they bleat.

This has become a rallying cry for those too frightened to think for themselves or too infatuated with controlling others to understand that life comes with risks and there is no perfect security.

Here’s what the science tells anyone who is being honest about it: open the schools, stop wearing masks outside, and everyone at low risk should start living normal lives. Not next fall, or next year- now. The lockdowns did not work, and weren’t necessary. Florida is the real life experiment that proves it. This debate should be over.

But instead of embracing the truth- and the freedom that would come with it- the lockdown Left is doubling down. They want to tell you to mask up next winter, and the one after that too. Get ready for years of this madness.

Americans can either take back their freedom, or have it doled out to us in small doses like squirts of useless hand sanitizer."

Many of the most troubling voting irregularities took place in states that set aside laws enacted by state legislatures in favor of sweeping changes ordered by governors, secretaries of state, and courts.

While legislators in many states have begun work on election reform to restore public confidence in state elections, unfortunately, congressional Democrats have chosen to sweep those valid concerns and reforms aside and to push forward a brazen attempt to nationalize elections in blatant disregard of the U.S. Constitution.

Congress will vote this week on HR 1, the so-called For the People Act, a massive 800-page election overhaul bill that would increase opportunities for election fraud, trample the First Amendment, further erode confidence in our elections, and forever dilute the votes of legally qualified eligible voters.

In 2008, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Indiana’s new voter ID law, the ruling noted that America has a long, well-documented history of election fraud. The court cited the 2005 report of the bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform headed by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker, which said the “electoral system cannot inspire public confidence if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud.”

HR 1 would eliminate those safeguards and prevent states from implementing new, needed reforms. Polling shows that large numbers of Democrats did not trust the outcome of the 2016 election and that large numbers of Republicans still do not trust the outcome of the 2020 election.

We have to do everything we can to change that and ensure that the American people, no matter which political party they favor, have confidence in the fairness and security of the election process.

HR 1 mandates the most questionable and abuse-prone election rules nationwide, while banning commonsense measures to detect, deter, and prosecute election fraud.

The bill would force states to adopt universal mail-in ballots, early voting, same-day voter registration, online voter registration, and automatic voter registration for any individual listed in state and federal government databases, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles and welfare offices, ensuring duplicate registrations and that millions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered to vote.

States would be required to count every mail-in vote that arrives up to 10 days after Election Day. States must also allow ballot harvesting—where paid political operatives collect absentee ballots from places such as nursing homes—exposing our most vulnerable voters to coercion and increasing the risk that their ballots will be tampered with.

At the same time, state and local election officials would be stripped of their ability to maintain the accuracy of voter rolls, barred from verifying voter eligibility, and voter ID would be banned from coast to coast.

Congressional districts would be redrawn by unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats. Illegal immigrants and law-abiding American citizens would receive equal representation in Congress. Felons would be able to vote the moment they set foot out of prison.

Leftists not only want you powerless at the ballot box, they want to silence and censor anyone who would dare to criticize their unconstitutional power grab.

HR 1 is also loaded with ill-advised changes to federal campaign laws that would impose onerous legal and administrative burdens on candidates, civic groups, unions, nonprofit organizations, and ordinary citizens who want to exercise their First Amendment rights to engage in political speech, including on public policy issues that are vital to the life of our nation.

Under HR 1, donations to many private organizations would be made public, exposing millions of Americans to the radical left’s cancel culture crusade.

Every single proposed change in HR 1 serves one goal, and one goal only: to give leftists a permanent, unfair, and unconstitutional advantage in our political system.

HR 1 would turn a blind eye to very real problems at the state level, exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, and further undermine the American people’s confidence in the principle of “one person, one vote.”

Election reform is a national imperative, but under our Constitution, election reform must be undertaken at the state level. Our Founders limited Congress’ role in conducting our elections for good reason: They wanted elections to be administered closest to the people, free from undue influence of the national government.

Having run for office at both the state and federal levels, I have concluded that the bedrock principles of free and fair elections are access, security, and the ability to engage in free and open debate.

HR 1 is an unconstitutional, reckless, and anti-democratic bill that would erode those foundational principles and could permanently damage our republic.

After a year in which our nation has endured a global pandemic, economic hardship, and a contentious election, now is not the time to further inflame passion and division. It is time for our nation’s leaders to help America heal.

To restore public confidence in our elections, our leaders should uphold the Constitution, reject congressional Democrats’ plan to nationalize our elections, and get about the serious work of state-based reform that will protect the integrity of the vote for every American.

The American people expect us to ensure that every eligible citizen is able to vote and also make sure that their vote is not stolen or diluted through errors, mistakes, or outright fraud.

Every citizen deserves the freedom to support, oppose, criticize, or promote the candidates and causes they believe in. And most importantly, the American people must have the utmost confidence that every voice matters, and every vote counts—or democracy cannot survive."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_588330,"Dumpsters full of shredded ballots were located today in Maricopa County Arizona.  This occurs only days before the Senate’s audit of the county’s 2020 election results is due to start.
For months the Board of Supervisors in Maricopa County have blocked and delayed any independent audit performed by the Arizona Senate of the County’s results in the 2020 Presidential election.  As we’ve reported previously, after being subpoenaed by the Arizona Senate and then suing the Senate to prevent a Senate audit of their 2020 election results, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors (MCBOS) agreed to have an audit if they could pick the auditors. The two firms they picked they claimed were the only two who were certified by the governmental body the US Election Assistance Commission (EAC). However, we found that these firms were not certified at the time they were selected by the MCBOS:
 
The MCBOS went ahead and hired the firms they wanted to perform their audit but the audits were never structured to find any suspected fraud in the county. The validity of the 2 million ballots in the county was never even considered in the programs reportedly used by these audit firms:

This is probably why these audits were set up the way they were (so no fraud would be identified). The auditors came to Phoenix and performed their work and some patriots found out that they could be observed on cameras in the facility where they were doing the work. These patriots watched and even sent a couple of individuals down to the center to check things out late one night. These individuals were greeted with a network that was labeled “f##k you”.
 
And as we reported, the audits were unprofessional in other areas as well:

This is when the Arizona Senate said enough and passed a bill that would grant the Arizona legislature the authority to subpoena election records like ballots and tabulating equipment and ignore any laws to the contrary.
The Senate is now in the process of selecting an auditor(s) to perform their audit.  As the day for their audit approaches the heat must have gotten too hot for those guarding the ballots in Maricopa County.

Per our source on the ground in the County, yesterday an individual went by the Maricopa County Tabulation and election center and found doors wide open with seeming uninhibited access to the facility.

Today some other interested individuals in the county stopped by the same facility and found huge piles of ballots in the dumpster outside the facility.

Someone ordered the ballots be shredded.

This is not the first state where we found shredded ballots after the election.  This also occurred in Georgia, another state where Biden won by a very slim margin.

Spokesman for Schumer, Angelo Roefaro tweeted of the “American Rescue Plan,” “Ok. Thanks to @SenSchumer NYS budget deficit for this year is…..Zero, nada, niete, zilch (NY terms).”

“The American Rescue Plan provides state government coffers with $12.6 billion in unrestricted aid, a measure championed by Schumer, the New York senior senator,” The New York Post reported. “Asked if the geyser of pandemic relief eliminates the needs for tax hikes or spending cuts, Roefaro told The Post, ‘the statement speaks for itself. … How NY decides its budgetary policy is a matter for the state legislature and the administration. Our job was to deliver resources to help NY confront and overcome Covid and its impacts, including the fiscal impact. And we did that fully and completely.’”

Check out what the San Francisco Chronicle reported in relation to Pelosi’s deficit:The federal stimulus package likely to be signed by President Biden this week will erase the majority of San Francisco’s projected $650 million budget deficit over the next two years, saving City Hall from having to make painful service cuts and layoffs — for now.
While the federal stimulus is a boon for the economy in the short term, it will not solve all of the city’s financial woes. San Francisco’s ultimate recovery heavily depends on how quickly parts of the local economy bounce back, from tourists visiting the city to employees returning to downtown offices.

Democrats are the epitome of corruption. Instead of managing their states’ budgets in a responsible manner, they rely on bailing themselves out at the expense of the American taxpayer when their negligence comes back to bite them.

According to a WalletHub report from June 2020, New York has the highest total tax burden at 12.28%. Responsible states like Florida are ranked 46th out of 50 states.

“The Senate-passed bill would waive federal tax obligations on the first $10,200 of jobless benefits. The provision would apply to households with incomes under $150,000,” CNBC reported. “A tax waiver on up to $10,200 of benefits may greatly reduce or eliminate a worker’s tax bill. Taxpayers may ultimately get money back from the IRS if they overpay, but that timing is unclear.”

“With its massive price tag, and major expansion of federal social safety net programs, the package is set to count among one of the largest rescue measures in U.S. history,” The Washington Post said.

“Both House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have labeled the bill a Democratic ‘wish list,’” NPR added."

Brett Blomme, an elected judge for Branch 5 of the Milwaukee County Circuit Court, is also the President and CEO of the Cream City Foundation.
The Cream City Foundation brags openly about organizing Drag Queen Story Hour events in Milwaukee on its website, sponsoring the practice in which impressionable youths are subjected to sexualized and cross-dressing drag queens.

Judge Blomme’s personal page on the Cream City Foundation’s website was purged within days following his arrest. Blomme appears to have been released from jail, with his Linkedin account also swiftly removed. The page attested to his connection with Cream City Foundation before being deleted.
 

An edited roster page on the Cream City Foundation’s website also profiles Blomme, describing him as a CEO and Past President of the organization.

Blomme had written articles about topics such as “trans cultural competency training” on Cream City’s website before the group deleted everything in the wake of his arrest.

The criminal complaint detailing the charges against Blomme alleges that he sent no less than 27 images and videos of child sexual abuse, using the messaging app Kik. In disturbing fashion, the complaint alleges that the abusive acts depicted in the material occurred in a Cottage Grove home owned by Blomme and his husband. The couple are the adoptive parents of two children.
On Wednesday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended Blomme from his duties pending the charges. A preliminary hearing is scheduled on May 27th, and the judge is yet to enter a plea.
Should Blomme be convicted of the criminal charges against him, the incident would be one of the most prominent examples of a child sex criminal securing power in the judicial system.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_913871,"Losing a new born is a heart breaking endeavour, as is the pain of losing an unborn child. Which is why we’re both saddened and shocked to bring you the latest update on the number of unborn and newborn children to lose their lives as a result of the mothers receiving one of the Covid-19 vaccines in the United Kingdom.
The Government have released weekly reports on adverse reactions to the experimental Covid-19 vaccines, the first of which covered data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme from the 9th December 2020 through to the 24th January 2021. Their latest report (find it here), which is the seventh to be released covers data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme from the 9th December 2020 though to the 7th March 2021.
Just six weeks separate the first and seventh report, and the shocking increase in the number of women losing their unborn and newborn child in that time due to having either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is appalling.
This was the Governments own advice upon emergency approval of the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine –
‘Pregnancy’
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2.
Animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine
BNT162b2 is not recommended during pregnancy.
For women of childbearing age, pregnancy should be excluded before vaccination. In addition, women
of childbearing age should be advised to avoid pregnancy for at least 2 months after their second dose.
We told you about this back in December, as the Governments own advice also included comments on breast-feeding and fertility which were as follows –
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is excreted in human milk. A risk to
the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should not be used
during breast-feeding.
Fertility
It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has an impact on fertility.’
It is because of this advice released by the UK Government that we were so shocked to see in the first released report of adverse reactions to the Covid vaccines, using data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme up to the 24th January 2021 a total of 4 women had suffered a miscarriage as a result of having the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

As well as a total of 2 women losing their unborn child as result of having the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

We’re still unable to answer why these women were given one of the Covid vaccines against the Governments own advice. But what’s truly shocking is how much this number has increased in the 6 weeks that have unfolded since.
According to the seventh report released by the UK Government on adverse reactions to the Covid vaccines, using data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme up to the 7th March 2021, there has been a 475% increase since the 24th January in the number of women who have lost their unborn child after having the Pfizer vaccine, bringing the total to 23. This is devastating.
Sadly there is also now 1 report of a premature baby sadly dying after the mother had the Pfizer vaccine.

The AstraZeneca jab has also caused unnecessary pain to expectant mothers. As of the 7th March there has been a 150% increase since the 24th January in the number of women to suffer a miscarriage, bringing the total to 5.
Tragically there has also been 1 still birth reported to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme after the mother had the AstraZeneca vaccine, but shockingly this has not been labelled as a fatality

The question is why are we seeing these numbers when the Governments own advice was that pregnant women should not have the vaccine?
Well we started digging and found that the Government has since updated it’s original advice to the following –
4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There is limited experience with use of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in pregnant women.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy,
embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development. Administration of
the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential
benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus.
This is criminal! We dread to think what sort of numbers of these events we will see in the weeks to come.
Informed consent is important, we don’t believe these women were informed in the slightest, and now they will have to suffer the eternal pain of losing their unborn or newborn child."

This data comes from the CDC’s VAERS database:

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_520421,"As can be expected when new experimental “vaccines” that are not approved by the FDA are given emergency use authorization to fight a “pandemic” that is now over a year old, reported deaths following the injections of these shots have now skyrocketed in the U.S. population by over 6000% here at the end of the first quarter of 2021, as compared to recorded deaths following FDA-approved vaccines at the end of the first quarter of 2020.

These new products, which many doctors and scientists claim do not even meet the legal definition of a “vaccine,” are described by the manufacturers themselves as “operating systems” called the “software of life,” and prior to COVID they have never been approved to be used on human populations.

There are literally thousands of doctors and scientists around the world who have spoken out against these experimental injections, some even calling them “biological weapons of mass destruction.”

Their voices are censored in the pharma-controlled corporate media and by Big Tech, so the people dying and becoming injured by these injections are the pro-vaccine people who primarily only get their information from these censored sources that are funded by Wall Street corporate billionaires, such as Bill Gates.

The CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a U.S. Government funded database that tracks injuries and deaths reported to be caused by vaccines, reported only 36 deaths during the first quarter of 2020 through March 31st, and almost 50% of those deaths were infants below the age of 3.

Since today, the day this report is being written and published, is the last day of March, 2021, we do not have complete stats from VAERS on injuries and deaths following vaccination yet. But here’s what we know based on what the CDC has published through yesterday, March 30, 2021.

The last data dump into VAERS was published last week on March 26, 2021, and it listed 2050 deaths following the experimental COVID injections. See the report here.

However, some of those deaths following the COVID injections occurred in December, 2020, when the Pfizer and Moderna shots were issued EUA’s by the FDA.

So we ran the report for this year, 2021, from which we know the data is only current through March 19, 2021, and it showed 1,754 deaths following ALL vaccines, not just the COVID injections.

Notice that 80% of these recorded deaths are among seniors over the age of 65!

How is this NOT a national tragedy that should be headline news everywhere??

As noted above, there are 2050 deaths recorded following COVID injections as of March 19th, but those include some deaths in December, 2020.

Yesterday, the CDC reported that deaths following COVID injections are now 2,509. (Source.)

That is an increase of 459 deaths from what the CDC reported through VAERS through March 19th. So 1754 plus these 459 deaths gives us the total deaths so far through March 2021, which is 2,213, although after the next data dump in to VAERS this coming Friday, this number will increase even more when we add the non-COVID vaccine deaths also.

That is an increase of over 6000% from last year during the same time period.

The increase in deaths reported is most certainly related to the new experimental COVID injections, and yet the CDC and FDA’s position is that NOT ONE of these deaths are related to the COVID injections.

As we have reported numerous times now, the CDC and FDA are criminal organizations run by Big Pharma insiders controlled by the Wall Street Billionaires and bankers. Their main interest is in protecting Big Pharma and their products, and not the health of the public.

Those in the public who continue to trust them for accurate medical advice will suffer dearly, many with their own lives, as seen happening right now in the first quarter of 2021 with a 6000% + increase in deaths by injection.

So far, these tragic deaths are among the foolish who drank the COVID Kool Aid and did not bother to research these new medical products themselves first, blindly trusting in “health authorities” like Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates who are MASS MURDERERS.

But once all of these pro-vaccine people eager to get the COVID “software of life” have been injected with this new human operating system which will need constant updates (booster shots), the eugencists will turn their attention to the “vaccine hesitant,” and they have all their ducks lined up in a row now.

They control the corporate mass media, including Big Tech, and they also control the American judicial system. At the very top we are dealing with psychopaths, most of them pedophiles involved in the Occult, and their goals are to control the world’s financial system, reduce the world’s population, and destroy the family and take over control of raising children for their own evil purposes.

The time is short now, where not a single person on this planet will be exempt from making very difficult choices that will no longer be optional.

This was written to a different group of people in a different day and age, but its principles are eternal, and as true today as any other point in history, if not more so today:

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_976479,"OPINION: This article contains commentary which reflects the author's opinion
The Biden administration’s border crisis is getting worse by the day, and their solution to the problem is apparently to leverage illegals into possible future votes.
According to a new report from the Center for Immigration Studies, the Biden administration is using a disturbing new policy being called “catch-and-bus.”
Under this policy, they are using taxpayer dollars to bus illegal immigrants caught at the U.S.-Mexico border to different states in America.
Here’s the kicker: the report states the Biden administration is bussing many of these illegals to Red states, meaning those that lean Republican.
CIS reports that the administration is busing many of these illegals from Texas, Arizona, and California into America’s heartland.
“The buses rolling in a steady daily succession out of Del Rio — one charter a day, seven days a week, and before that weeks of filling Greyhound buses — represent a microcosm of a much broader aspect of the unfolding mass-migration crisis at the southern border that has attracted limited media coverage and occurs largely outside public view,” CIS stated.
“Tens of thousands of immigrants caught illegally crossing the border and then released under the new leniency policy of President Joe Biden are now dispersing to four corners of the United States on buses, with some of the more moneyed ones taking passenger jets,” the report added.
“Where are the buses going?” the CIS rhetorically asked.
“They often drop their Haitian, Venezuelan, and Cuban passengers in Florida and New Jersey. Those from Nicaragua and other Central American nations have been delivered to Tennessee, Massachusetts, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, and to large cities in Texas such as Dallas and Houston,” the report added.
Below is a video on the report and what is happening:
The Biden administration’s border crisis has gotten so bad that even CNN is calling them out for it.
An explosive report last week revealed children detained in an overcrowded government-run tent facility at the US-Mexico border say they haven’t been able to shower for days or contact their parents.
Some children get to shower about once a week and sometimes soap runs out, with only shampoo available, she said. One child told Welch she hadn’t showered in six days.
In fact, Democrats in New York are working on creating a fund that would give some illegal aliens and ex-convicts more than $20,000 apiece in direct payments related to the coronavirus pandemic.
New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office is reportedly in talks with state lawmakers to create something called the Excluded Workers Fund, which would offer direct payments to “undocumented immigrants and formerly incarcerated individuals” who missed out on work opportunities amid the pandemic.
“Right now discussions are around eligibility and access,” Democratic state Sen. Jessica Ramos told the outlet.
Just to be even clearer, Politico directly reports: “New York’s proposal would provide some recipients with more than $27,000.”
Some illegal immigrants and ex-convicts could see an immediate payment of $20,700, with an additional $6,600 coming later. "

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_206180,"Rap legend DMX, real name Earl Simmons, is currently in the ICU after suffering from a massive heart attack. Early reports speculated that DMX's condition may have been brought about because of an alleged drug overdose.
Screen Shot 2020-05-27 at 7.55.49 AM
But MTO News spoke with a member of the Simmons family who believes that it was NOT drugs that caused the heart attack.
In an EXCLUSIVE interview, MTO News spoke with DMX' family member who told us that the rapper received the COVID vaccine about a week before he suffered from the heart attack.
DMX's family member told MTO News, ""[DMX] got the vaccine when they opened it up to people over 50. He got it so that he could go travel and perform, stuff like that.""
New York State opened up the COVID-19 vaccinations for people over the age of 50 in mid March.
And the family member suspects that DMX heart attack could have been a reaction to the vaccine. The family member explained, ""Everyone [in the news] keeps saying that [DMX] had a drug overdose. How do they know. I'm in the family and no doctor told me anything about an overdose.""

The family member is FURIOUS about the speculation surrounding DMX drug use. She told MTO News, ""Yes he had past issues with drugs. But nobody knows that he had an OD. It's f**cked up that its being reported like that.""
She told MTO News that she - and the family - are considering taking legal action against news publications prematurely concluding that DMX  suffered a drug overdose.
But what is clear - according to the family member - is that DMX did take the Covid vaccine.
The grieving kin explained, ""He took that vaccine, and he had a heart attack. I'm not saying the vaccine did it, but he never had a heart attack before.""
Over 167 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through April 5, 2021. During this time, The CDC received only 2,794 reports of death among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. "

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_997407,"A recent Stanford study released by the NCBI, which is under the National Institutes of Health, showed that masks do absolutely nothing to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and their use is even harmful. 
NIH published a medical hypothesis by Dr. Baruch Vainshelboim (Cardiology Division, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System/Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States).
NOQ Report uncovered the study:
Did you hear about the peer-reviewed study done by Stanford University that demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that face masks have absolutely zero chance of preventing the spread of Covid-19? No? It was posted on the the National Center for Biotechnological Information government website. The NCBI is a branch of the National Institute for Health, so one would think such a study would be widely reported by mainstream media and embraced by the “science-loving” folks in Big Tech.

Instead, a DuckDuckGo search reveals it was picked up by ZERO mainstream media outlets and Big Tech tyrants will suspend people who post it, as political strategist Steve Cortes learned the hard way when he posted a Tweet that went against the face mask narrative. The Tweet itself featured a quote and a link that prompted Twitter to suspend his account, potentially indefinitely.
The NCBI study begins with the following abstract:
Many countries across the globe utilized medical and non-medical facemasks as non-pharmaceutical intervention for reducing the transmission and infectivity of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Although, scientific evidence supporting facemasks’ efficacy is lacking, adverse physiological, psychological and health effects are established. Is has been hypothesized that facemasks have compromised safety and efficacy profile and should be avoided from use. The current article comprehensively summarizes scientific evidences with respect to wearing facemasks in the COVID-19 era, providing prosper information for public health and decisions making.
The study concludes (emphasis added):
The existing scientific evidences challenge the safety and efficacy of wearing facemask as preventive intervention for COVID-19. The data suggest that both medical and non-medical facemasks are ineffective to block human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, supporting against the usage of facemasks. Wearing facemasks has been demonstrated to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological effects. These include hypoxia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, increased acidity and toxicity, activation of fear and stress response, rise in stress hormones, immunosuppression, fatigue, headaches, decline in cognitive performance, predisposition for viral and infectious illnesses, chronic stress, anxiety and depression. Long-term consequences of wearing facemask can cause health deterioration, developing and progression of chronic diseases and premature death. Governments, policy makers and health organizations should utilize prosper and scientific evidence-based approach with respect to wearing facemasks, when the latter is considered as preventive intervention for public health.
Here is the table for physiological and psychological effects of wearing a facemask:

via Disrn:

Though Biden’s 52% rating ranks a full 10 points higher than his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, it still falls well below the marks typically achieved by U.S. presidents enjoying their “honeymoon period” with the American people.

Trump’s 42% rating was the lowest since official ratings began to be recorded in 1945, followed by President Gerald Ford’s 48%. Biden comes in third worst at 52%.
In contrast, several presidents in modern history have ranked well over 60% after their first 100 days. Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, enjoyed a 69% approval rating. George H.W. Bush was even better at 71%.

Former President Ronald Reagan is still the current record holder for having the highest rating at this part of a presidency, at 73% approval.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_964725,"Pfizer Confirms COVID-Vaccinated People Can ‘Shed’ Spike Proteins And Harm The Unvaccinated
A new study has confirmed that people who have been vaccinated against COVID produce excessive spike proteins that are capable of passing the Blood Brain Barrier causing irreparable damage to the brain — and Pfizer’s own documents warn that vaccinated people actually shed these excessive spike proteins putting the unvaccinated at risk for harm:
In their latest issue brief, America’s Frontline Doctors (AFLDS) warned how spike proteins resulting from experimental COVID-19 gene therapy vaccines have the capacity to 1.) pass through the “blood-brain barrier” causing neurological damage, 2.) be “shed” by the vaccinated, bringing about sickness in unvaccinated children and adults, and 3.) cause irregular vaginal bleeding in women.
Released last week and titled “Identifying Post-vaccination Complications & Their Causes: an Analysis of Covid-19 Patient Data,” the stated purpose of the document is “to provide additional information for concerned citizens, health experts, and policymakers about adverse events and other post-vaccination issues resulting from the three experimental COVID-19 vaccines currently administered under EUA (emergency use authorization)” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The non-profit organization highlighted the thousands of adverse events which are related to these “vaccines” and captured by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). “Yet these complications have received a fraction of the attention paid to J&J’s blood-clotting controversy,” they lamented with dismay, asking, “Why?”
In taking a closer look at this data, AFLDS presents “some major categories of concern as-yet publicly unaddressed by either the FDA or CDC,” asserting that failure of these regulators “to consider these and other ‘known unknowns’ is a dereliction of basic medical research.”
They breakout their general categories of concern as shown below:
First, there are significant fears regarding the wide distribution of these new vaccines, which employ a new technology and remain only experimental without full approval from the FDA. Instead of employing an attenuated antigen response – as happens with conventional vaccines – these experimental agents introduce something called a “spike protein” into one’s system.
“It takes years to be sure something new is safe,” the AFLDS document confirms. “No one knows definitively the long-term health implications for the body and brain, especially among the young, related to this spike protein. In addition, if documented problems with the protein do arise, there will never be any way to reverse the adverse effects in those already vaccinated.”
Second, unlike conventional vaccines, these spike proteins, along with “lipid nanoparticles” have the capacity to pass through the “blood-brain barrier” which provides special protection for these sensitive areas of the body.
“There simply has not been enough time to know what brain problems and how often a brain problem will develop from that,” the document warns.
Risks from such penetration include “chronic inflammation and thrombosis (clotting) in the neurological system, contributing to tremors, chronic lethargy, stroke, Bell’s Palsy and ALS-type symptoms. The lipid nanoparticles can potentially fuse with brain cells, resulting in delayed neuro-degenerative disease. And the mRNA-induced spike protein can bind to brain tissue 10 to 20 times stronger than the spike proteins that are (naturally) part of the original virus.”
Third, as these experimental vaccines produce many trillions of spike proteins in their recipients, these vaccinated individuals “can shed some of these (spike protein) particles to close contacts,” causing disease in them.
In an email correspondence with LifeSiteNews, Dr. Simone Gold, the founder of AFLDS, directed this writer to an April 29 tweet where she posted a document from Pfizer’s experimental trials in which the pharmaceutical giant “acknowledges this mechanism” of potential shedding, she wrote.
As the document states, one can be “exposed to [the] study intervention due to environmental exposure,” including “by inhalation or skin contact” with someone involved in the study, or with another who has been exposed in the same way.
And this, according to AFLDS, can be dangerous. As the issues brief continues, “the spike proteins are pathogenic (‘disease causing’) just like the full virus.” Furthermore, these “spike proteins bind more tightly than the fully intact virus” and thus cases around the world of “pericarditis, shingles, pneumonia, blood clots in the extremities and brain, Bell’s Palsy, vaginal bleeding and miscarriages have been reported in persons who are near persons who have been vaccinated.” Such shedding also “appears to be causing wide variety of autoimmune disease (where the body attacks its own tissue) in some persons.”
In addition, other more serious dangers to even the unvaccinated are possible due to the fact that these “spike proteins can cross the blood brain barrier, unlike traditional vaccines.”
Fourth, such shedding leaves children vulnerable if they are in proximity to parents and teachers who have received these experimental vaccines. While the threat of COVID-19 to the young is rightly described as “irrelevant,” including a 99.997% survival rate for those under 20 years of age, AFLDS is concerned some children may become symptomatic due to such proximity to the vaccinated. At such point there is a danger that “public health bureaucrats” might use such cases to “speculate that a child’s illness is related to a SARS-CoV-2 ‘variant,’” when it is a result of contact with vaccinated adults.
“Our other concern is that children could develop long-term chronic autoimmune disease including neurological problems due to the fact that children have decades ahead of them and trillions of the spike proteins mentioned above.”
Fifth, “AFLDS is aware of thousands of reports involving vaginal bleeding, post-menopausal vaginal bleeding, and miscarriages following COVID-19 vaccination as well as anecdotal reports of similar adverse events among those in close contact with the vaccinated.” While at this point the independent physicians organization “cannot comment definitively on the close contacts” other than to mention they “have heard reports of this worldwide,” the many reported incidents of post-vaccination vaginal bleeding establishes a clear “connection between the vaccine and irregular bleeding.”
“Despite this clear-cut evidence, menstrual-cycle changes were not listed among the FDA’s common side effects in its phase-three clinical participants. Women’s reproductive health needs to be taken seriously rather than waved away by agenda-driven public health officials,” the brief reads.
Finally, acknowledging the “irrepressible economic incentive among pharmaceutical companies” to market unnecessary and dangerous childhood COVID vaccines, boosters, and the like, AFLDS insists “Public health experts should stop and assess data on possible vaccine side effects and related post-vaccination questions before it is too late.”
So Pfizer’s own internal report (on page 69) warns health care workers about being exposed to people who have been vaccinated — which is rather ironic considering most health care workers are required to be vaccinated themselves.
Anyone walking in to a hospital or doctor’s office will be exposed to the spike proteins being shed by virtually the entire staff of workers — but the concentrations will be low compared to what is in the blood streams of the vaccinated.
Of course, the amount of spike proteins you could actually breathe in is miniscule compared to the amount that these vaccines are programming vaccinated people’s bodies to manufacture — non-stop 24/7.
A recent study confirms that the spike proteins produced by the mRNA vaccines can indeed cause serious health problems as they continuously build up in the vaccinated.
As literally trillions of these spike proteins build up and overwhelm your body, your internal organs will begun to shut down and your brain will stop functioning — which is why a U.K. government report is predicting a huge percentage of doubly vaccinated people will be dying in the coming “Third Wave” of the fake pandemic.
This coming massive death toll will, of course, be blamed on new, exotic-sound virus “variant” — or better yet, “scare-iants” — and the “selfish unvaccinated.”
Needless to say, it would behoove everyone who is unvaccinated to avoid extended exposure to the vaccinated, especially in confined spaces.
The entire world has never been deceived on such a massive scale.
It would appear that Satan indeed has been loosed from his prison — and he knows his time is short to make this final move to dominate this world before he is destroyed."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_108582,"Joe Biden and Jill Biden visited an elementary school in Yorktown, Virginia on Monday — and it went about as well as one might expect.
Biden walked into a classroom full of masked children sitting at desks behind massive plastic partitions.
The sight alone of children being fully masked and behind these jail-like plexiglass barriers is enough to enrage most Americans.
But then Biden made matter worse when he asked the clearly young children if they were teenagers in high school.
WATCH:

Biden suffered another embarrassing gaffe over the weekend when he had to ask his wife to help him find his fae mask when it was in his own pocket.
During a speech in Duluth, Georgia, Biden, who is fully vaccinated and wants everyone else to be vaccinated because, he says, it keeps them safer, was in a panic looking for his lost mask at the end of his speech.

President Joe Biden momentarily lost his mask following a speech marking 100 days in office Thursday evening in Duluth, Georgia.
His wife, first lady Jill Biden, walked over to him and pointed to her mask, after which the president, who is fully vaccinated but has made a point of setting an example for others in wearing a mask even when solo as a COVID-19 precaution, started looking around behind the podium.
With Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff approaching them on the stage, Biden could be seen flipping through a binder’s pages before he started shouting about how he could not find his mask.
“I’ve lost my mask! I can’t find my mask!” the panicked Biden was heard saying near the microphone as he looked for his mask.
“I’m looking for my mask! I’m in trouble!” he said into the microphone to the attendees.
Biden eventually got a mask and held it for the crowd to see before putting it on and walking off the stage.
But in a more consequential part of the speech Biden answered protesters who demanded he abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement with a request for more time.
Joe Biden gave an ominous message to hecklers at a rally Georgia when he was interrupted by them and their disdain for the current immigration system.
The protesters shouted, “end detentions now” and “abolish ICE” as well as “communities not cages” as Biden told a member of his staff to give them a microphone.
“I agree with you, I’m working on it, man, give me another five days,” Biden said in an attempt to end the heckling, and then he explained.
“Folks, you all know what they’re talking about. There should be no private prisons period. Private detention centers. They should not exist. And we’re working to close all of them,” he said.
But that is not what the hecklers said. They did not mention a thing about private prison. They mentioned abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“We voted for you too,” one of the protesters said.
“I promise you,” Biden said, The Daily Mail reported.
The speech came a mere two days after the Biden White House announced the nomination of  Texas, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.
“Sheriff Ed Gonzalez is a strong choice for ICE Director. With a distinguished career in law enforcement and public service, Sheriff Gonzalez is well-suited to lead ICE as the agency advances our public safety and homeland security mission. I hope the Senate will swiftly confirm Sheriff Gonzalez to this critical position,” Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas said of his appointment.
“Separating families who arrive at our border harms children and is an affront to American values. Children should not be in immigration detention, period,” the sheriff, a staunch critic of Donald Trump, tweeted in 2018, CNN reported.
It also comes as Kamala Harris has faced criticism for not going to the border to address what many are calling a crisis.

She said that she will be holding a virtual trade mission and then an in person visit later to address the issues of farmers who have been hit hard by natural disasters in Mexico and El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
“We’re making progress, but it’s not going to evidence itself overnight. It will not. But it will be worth it, and I will tell you part of my approach to this is we’ve got to institutionalize the work and also internationalize it,” Harris said.
She said she is working with United Nations Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield to have other nations help stem the tide of migrants.
“Because, again, this is about the Western Hemisphere. We are a neighbor in the Western Hemisphere, and it is also about understanding that we have the capacity to actually get in there, if we are consistent,” Harris said.
And, on brand, she attacked Donald Trump and his administration for damaging ties with other nations and said that she and Biden are working to fix that.
“We have to rebuild it, and I’ve made it very clear to our team that this has to be a function of an American priority, and not just a function of whoever happens to be sitting in this chair,” she said."

Politifact_FALSE_Social media_726257,"""BREAKTHROUGH CASES"": When The V8ccinated Still Get the Virus, V8ccines Fail, and How The CDC Are Attempting to Hide It All
The decisions made by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are indicative of decisions that are being implemented by health authorities worldwide. Aligned with WHO, and utterly complicit in coordinating all aspects of the ""official pandemic narrative,"" a CDC release, or website update, is undoubtedly a revelation of what is being observed in countries everywhere. 
The CDC is acknowledging on their website that 'there will be a small percentage of people who are fully v8ccinated who still get sick, are hospitalized, or die from C.OVID-19.' They also admit that, 'there is some evidence that v8ccination may make illness less severe,' but do not confirm that v8ccination stops transmission, inoculates, or actually protects against C.OVID.
'Some evidence"" is not very convincing.
Indeed, bizarrely, the CDC still recommends:
'...that fully v8ccinated people continue to take steps to protect themselves and others in many situations, like wearing a mask, maintaining an appropriate social distance from others, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and washing their hands often.'
Basically, the official CDC advice is that the v8ccinated should still observe all prior precautions, and behave exactly as if they had not received their shots. It would seem that such “jabbed” individuals have neither reduced their risk, nor improved their plight in the slightest. 
Truthfully - it is because they have not. 
BREAKTHROUGH CASES AND MEANINGLESS “VARIATIONS”
The CDC have also cautioned that a small number of those v8ccinated will experience a rare ""breakthrough"" case, as 'v8ccines are not 100% effective.'
A ""breakthrough case"" occurs when an individual tests positive to C.OVID despite being deemed inoculated after receiving the required sequence of shots. To acquire post-v8ccinated infection is considered a ""breaking-through"" of the protection afforded by v8ccination.
Such cases are supposedly the result of variations, but each variation is a mere 0.3% mutation from the original strand, (according to former Pfizer Vice President, Mike Yeadon*) which means it is essentially 99.7% similar to the original - a clinically identical virus. This is significant, as T cells of those previously infected by SARS-CoV (SARS) in 2003 (a similar precursor coronavirus that is 20% different to C.OVID-19 aka SARS-CoV-2) not only recognised SARS-CoV in the present day (indicating lasting natural immunity) but, according to scientists testing the T cells in blood samples - they were also immune to SAR-CoV-2 (despite the whopping 20% mutated difference). The T cells had no difficulty recognising and reacting and conferring immunity.
Thus, recovered SARS patients from 2003 had a lasting T cell immunity to all coronaviruses, including C.OVID-19. 
Essentially, a v8ccine produced for C.OVID-19, if truly effective, should have absolutely no difficulty in also inoculating against all minor mutations of 0.3%. This infinitesimal percentile change should be within the covered capacity range. However, these v8ccines do not, as they evidently do not protect against the supposed original strain of C.OVID-19 (and those emerging 0.3% mutations that are clinically identical.) 
Quite simply: all current ""mutations"" are clinically identical to the original strain, and any claim of a variant “breaking through” protection is an admission that the v8ccine does not work as promoted - the variation ""breakthrough"" claim is an official excuse to conceal lack of general v8ccine efficacy against C.OVID-19.
CDC’s NATIONAL BREAKTHROUGH DATABASE AND HOW THEY NOW DETERMINE COUNTABLE CASES 
It would seem that such ""breakthroughs"" have neither been 'small' in number, and thus not 'rare' in occurrence - and so the CDC has devised an official protocol to obfuscate evidence of monumental v8ccine failure.
In an endeavour to perpetuate the perception that the v8ccination campaign is successful, the CDC has 'developed a national COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough REDCap database.' One would assume that this is for transparency purposes, but the means of classifying and recording ""breakthrough"" cases reveals the deception.
According to the CDC, from May 14, they are transitioning to only reporting ""breakthough” infection of patients ‘who died or were hospitalised.’ Supposedly, this is ‘to maximise the quality of the data collected on the cases of greatest clinical and public health importance...’
However, the great majority of those who contract C.OVID-19 were neither hospitalised, nor died, and this will also be true of those who are supposedly v8ccinated who then get infected. Such a drastic change in official reporting is inherently disingenuous, and serves to conceal the true number of those who will test positive despite being v8ccinated. This will not ‘maximise the quality of data,’ but has been purposely implemented to ensure the very concealment of data that might reflect the majority of actual ""breakthrough"" cases. The true number would conclusively reveal the worthlessness of v8ccination. 
This is clearly a strategic deception  bolstering support for the ongoing V8ccine Agenda.    
LOWERING THE PCR CYCLES FOR BREAKTHROUGH CASES ONLY (28 cycles or less for “breakthroughs” amongst v8ccinated; 40-45 cycles still recommended for unv8ccinated cases)
The CDC has advised that the PCR test cycles for “breakthroughs” must now be calibrated at below 28 cycles, an amplification rate that will ensure few, if any ‘false positives.’ This is great if the intent is to lower the previous rate of positive case detection; inversely, it also reveals the exact means they have used to generate increasingly more “positive cases.”
With C.OVID-19 positive cases, the PCR tests were calibrated at 40-45 cycles to effectively harvest unlimited false positives (89-94% of the time), and to generate the ever increasing “cases numbers.” 
The daily media promotion of these accumulating ""case numbers” had been crucial to establish the “threat,” and to project a convincing pandemic illusion.
Now it is being used in reverse, to reverse the success of the previous PCR illusion in the instance of the v8ccinated.
This lower cycle PCR methodology will suppress the true number of ""breakthrough"" cases - that is the intent.
A RETURN TO NORMAL – IS NOW.
Given that a 'return to normal' is supposedly predicated on everyone being v8ccinated and rendered immune - these anomalous “breakthroughs” are not anomalies; but, rather, represent the breaking-through of the truth into reality. 
Many fully v8ccinated individuals are inexplicably contracting C.OVID-19. The only logical conclusion is that these v8ccines do not work 100% of the time; and probably not most of the time... if any of the time.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_127874,"In August 2020 The Gateway Pundit’s Joe Hoft posted an article about COVID-19 that sent shockwaves throughout the internet — The CDC website admitted that only around 6% of COVID recorded deaths were due entirely to the Coronavirus-

The gist of the report was that COVID-19 is not nearly as deadly as first projected by the WHO and then by Dr. Tony Fauci and Dr. Debra Birx.  Based on CDC numbers in Ausust  only 6% of all deaths attributed to COVID-19 were instances where the only factor in the individual’s death was due to COVI9-19.
From the CDC website.

For all the other deaths reported by the CDC linked to COVID-19, the individuals who passed away had 2-3 other serious illnesses or co-morbidities.
This came from actual data from the CDC and was tweeted by Mel Q on Twitter.
Twitter user Mel Q shared a calculation which showed that 6% of all COVID-19 deaths as reported by the CDC turned out to be 9,201 deaths at the time. 
Only 9,201 people died in the US according to August numbers where COVID-19 was the only cause of death.

We used Mel Q’s tweet in our report and the President of the United States retweeted Mel Q’s tweet as well.
But  Twitter took down the tweet claiming fake news.  They notified Mel Q that the tweet that used actual CDC data “violated their policy on misleading information about COVID-19.”  Her account was suspended from posting for 12 hours.
Then the far left hacks at CNN wrote an article about this calculation, the President’s retweet and our article entitled – Twitter removes QAnon supporter’s false claim about coronavirus death statistics that Trump had retweeted. They refused to look at the science.
On Sunday CDC Director Rochelle Walensky finally admitted that “many, many hospitals” were counting COVID deaths to include cases that were not COVID deaths.
The Gateway Pundit was right.
Trump was right.
The tech giants and CNN were wrong again pushing fake news.
But we were the ones who were punished.
We see this a lot.
The Epoch Times reported:
Of the people who died after being fully vaccinated, 42 were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19, according to the CDC. Additionally, 342 of the hospitalizations were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19.
“Many, many hospitals are screening people for COVID when they come in, so not all of those 223 cases who had COVID actually died of COVID. They may have had mild disease, but died, for example, of a heart attack,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
Under the usual counting program, people who have not been vaccinated but who die of heart attacks or other causes are typically listed as a COVID-19 death.

This is the first time in a year since the CDC admitted in public that “many, many” of the hospitals are labeling COVID deaths that are actually heart attacks, or cancer, or poisonings, etc.
And it does not just pertain to those who took the COVID vaccine.
The nation needs an audit on this horrible chapter in American history.
Here is the video of CDC Director Walensky on CNN."

""Black Lives Matter stands in solidarity with Palestinians,"" the group tweeted. ""We are a movement committed to ending settler colonialism in all forms and will continue to advocate for Palestinian liberation. ( always have. And always will be ). #freepalestine.""

The announcement prompted a ""thank you"" tweet from the controversial Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, or BDS, which has for years called for an economic embargo of Israel.

""Thank you for your solidarity,"" the left-wing group tweeted in response. ""From Ferguson to Palestine, our struggles against racism, white supremacy and for a just world are united!""

The tweet came as pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in the U.S. and other Western countries to call for a cease-fire in the region.

Amid the ongoing battle between Israel and Hamas militants, at least 12 Israelis and 213 Palestinians have been killed over the past eight days, including 61 children and 36 women. More than 100 Israelis and 1,400 Palestinians had been wounded as of Tuesday evening.

The military conflict escalated dramatically on May 10 when Hamas began firing rocket after rocket at Jerusalem following a violent clash between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters at the Al-Aqsa mosque, a sacred site for both Jews and Muslims. Despite hundreds of Israeli counterattacks and its Iron Dome defense system, the rockets have continued to fly.

But left-wing groups, and progressive lawmakers, have blamed Israel for the violence, describing it as an ""apartheid state"" committing ""war crimes"" and other atrocities on Palestinian civilians, who Hamas frequently treats like human shields, attracting airstrikes on high-rise buildings that share space with civilians.

The Israeli Defense Forces say they warn civilians ahead of strikes on such locations, giving them time to run for safety before leveling Hamas facilities.

""Israel fights to protect its civilians,"" the IDF tweeted Tuesday. ""Hama uses civilians to protect itself."""

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_959225,"The United States military has arrested Dr. Deborah Birx, also known as “the scarf lady,” after authenticating reports that she and her partner in crime, the still at-large Dr. Anthony Fauci, had conspired with the CDC to intentionally deceive the American public into believing that face masks were an effective method to mitigate the spread of Covid-19.
As reported in February, Birx’s name was placed on a sealed indictment after President Donald J. Trump obtained a lengthy email chain between her and Deep State Dr. Anthony Fauci. In it, Birx and Fauci discussed whether face masks mitigated the spread of Covid-19, and they admitted to one another that masks were completely ineffective at preventing Covid-19 from entering the human respiratory system. To the contrary, they acknowledged that protracted “masking” had serious side effects on human physiology, especially among the children, the elderly, and immunocompromised people.
Nonetheless, Birx wrote in an email to Fauci that “regardless of POTUS’s stance, we must continue to encourage and enforce masking because it will give people a sense of calm and make them feel safe.”
That illusion of safety was a major contributing factor in the deaths of 15,000 Americans, according to a military study that evaluated all alleged Covid-19 fatalities in the United States.
For example, a masked 13-year-old boy suddenly dropped dead while playing football in 90-degree heat in Reno, Nevada. It turned out he was asthmatic but had never received a clinical diagnosis. His mother, a mask advocate, had heard Dr. Birx say on television that outdoor activities did not preclude wearing a mask when social distancing was impossible. Since football is a contact sport, she feared her child might contract Covid-19 from another non-masked child, and thus demanded her son mask up anytime he was around other children. Her irrational fear, coupled with Birx’s hysteria, resulted in the boy’s death. Incidentally, the CDC claimed he died of Covid-19, even though the boy had never received a test.
Another example: A 26-year-old Long Island woman died after a short battle with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, more commonly known as MRSA, a type of flesh-eating bacteria that is highly resistant to most antibiotics. She developed the illness, which attacked her face, days after her employer, citing CDC guidelines, imposed a mask mandate. The bacteria literally ate her face, leaving her unrecognizable. She expired three days later, and the CDC listed her cause of death as Covid-19.
Those are only 2 of 15,000 evaluated cases.
A confidential source involved in Donald J. Trump’s Deep State War said: “Along with Fauci, who will soon be apprehended too, the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps is holding Birx responsible for all the fatalities. It’s mass medical malpractice and mass murder. They acted on the indictment Wednesday morning.”
On 26 May, plain-clothed JAG investigators arrived at the multigenerational Pennsylvania home where Birx resides with her husband and the family of their eldest daughter. JAG, our source said, informed Birx she was being placed under arrest by order of the United States military and in accordance with Section 252 of the U.S. Insurrection Act of 1807. Birx reportedly appeared confused, and her husband, a lawyer, protested the “unlawful intrusion” of their home, saying that neither JAG nor Donald Trump had authority over the citizenry.
Birx was handcuffed and escorted from the home, and her family was issued a gag order forbidding them from discussing Birx’s arrest with the media. Violating the order, JAG told them, would carry a stiff penalty, including prison."

Former State Dept. investigator David Asher discusses Dr. Fauci’s leaked emails and the media's dismissal of the Wuhan lab leak theory on ‘America’s Newsroom.'

Former State Department investigator David Asher weighed in Wednesday on leaked emails of Dr. Anthony Fauci, including correspondence with a key figure linked to the Wuhan Institute of Virology who thanked Fauci for using his voice to ""dispel the myths"" that the COVID-19 pandemic may have been a product of a lab leak. 

""I just wanted to say a personal thank you on behalf of our staff and collaborators, for publicly standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural for COVID-19 from a bat-to-human spillover, not a lab from the Wuhan Insitute of Virology,"" said Ecohealth Alliance President Peter Daszak in April of 2020.

""From my perspective, your comments are brave, and coming from your trusted voice, will help dispel the myths being spun around the virus’s origins...""

During an ""America’s Newsroom"" interview with Bill Hemmer, Asher was asked why the Wuhan lab leak theory was dismissed early in the pandemic by scientific experts. 

""We’ve been told in the last three days that lab leaks happen all the time. We’ve had epidemiologists on the air for 15 months—that was not something we heard a lot and suddenly in the last four days everyone’s talking about it,"" Hemmer said. 

Speaking specifically about Daszak, who also served as a member of the WHO-led inquiry into the origins of COVID-19, Asher hypothesized that the Ecohealth president may have been ""prompted"" to dismiss information indicating that the coronavirus escaped from a lab.

""Can you trust these scientists? I don’t trust these scientists right now"" said Asher. ""I trust our national lab scientists, I trust our Army scientists. I don’t trust these paid, in the pocket by Chinese scientists.""

In May of 2020, Daszak said there was ""zero evidence"" that the virus came out of a lab in China during an appearance on ""60 Minutes.""

More than 3,200 emails linked to Dr. Fauci were obtained by BuzzFeed News that have been made available online.  

In addition, The Washington Post received at least 860 pages and hundreds more were made public under the Freedom of Information Act. "

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_121708,"The Joint Vaccination and Immunisation Committee (JVCI) in the United Kingdom has advised that Covid 19 vaccine should be administered to all pregnant women. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States says that all pregnant women can have the Covid-19 vaccine if they want to. But how did these health officials come to the conclusion that Covid vaccinations are safe to use during pregnancy?

According to the JVCI, pregnant women should be offered the Covid vaccines since “in the United States, approximately 90,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated, primarily with Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, with no safety problems reported.” Is this, however, correct?

According to the most recent statistics from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the United States, 395 women have reported losing their unborn child as a result of Covid vaccinations. This may not seem like a lot out of 90,000, but keep in mind that about 1% to 10% of adverse responses are actually reported to the VAERS system, and there is a major backlog due to the large number of adverse responses recorded to the Covid vaccinations. As a result, the data shown in the VAERS system does not include every report submitted up to May 21st, and reports from January are only now being added to the system.

How do we know that only 1% of negative reactions are reported? Because a report commissioned by the US Department of Health in 2011 concludes that way –
“Drug and vaccination side effects are prevalent, but under-reported. Despite the fact that 25% of ambulatory patients have an adverse drug event, only about 0.3 percent of all adverse drug events and 1-13 percent of significant events are reported to the FDA (FDA). Vaccine adverse effects are also recorded at a rate of less than 1%.“"

In today’s world, there are quite a few things that appear to be scarce in 2021. I’m no macroeconomist but I would tend to think that these are probably situations that come in the wake of a post-COVID world where things have shut down for quite some time. Over time, my best guess would be that we will start to see things come back to normal.
I’m not going to speak for everybody but I think that quite a few people abide by this theory. However, telling somebody that there’s no need to frantically resource hoard with a shortage isn’t going to do much for somebody who’s already in a frantic mindset.
One of the most recent instances of mass hoarding of resources happened when the Colonial Pipeline shut down after a hack and a lot of folks were afraid they wouldn’t be able to get gasoline.
The lines at the pumps certainly extended and in some cases, folks were getting all of the gas that they could, even if it meant filling up every container they had and even creating some new ones that weren’t exactly the safest. In one case, we would even see a Hummer go up in flames with a variety of full gas cans in the back.
This time, we join in with a situation that finds a man with a pickup truck at the gas pump. However, instead of filling safe cans or his truck’s tank, he has lined the entire bed of the truck with a tarp and is filling it up like a swimming pool.
Needless to say, this is definitely something that professionals of all sorts would recommend avoiding. We would presume that the majority of this fuel probably didn’t make it home and ended laying on the highway somewhere."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_534017,"The president is borrowing a page from the Obama administration to “never let a serious crisis go to waste.” It’s as clear as the day is long what the Biden administration set out to do since day one of his presidency: Use the pandemic to shift the political landscape, reshape the economy and expand the social safety net by squeezing trillions of dollars from the American taxpayer for generations to come. Biden’s bloated budget overtaxes, overspends and overpromises. It’s a massive government overreach that would saddle future generations with deficit spending as far as the eye can see.

The $6.3 trillion spending blueprint effectively would redesign the size and scope of the federal government, shoehorning Uncle Sam’s footprint into every aspect of American life, from the workplace to households with cradle to grave entitlements that include one-size-fits-all universal preschool, child care, paid family leave, community college, elder care and more. There’s no sugar-coating what Biden’s progressive pipe dream would do to the economy.

America can’t tax, spend and borrow our way to prosperity. In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office agrees how Biden’s agenda would flout the entrepreneurial spirit. Increasing taxes on labor and capital to pay for expansive social welfare programs would decrease economic growth and productivity. When taxes go up on labor, the incentive to work goes down. When taxes go up on capital, the incentive to save and invest goes down. One of the most basic principles of tax policy 101: when you tax something, you get less of it, from wage growth and job creation to investment in innovation.

By the end of Biden’s term in 2024, the debt ratio as a share of the nation’s economy is projected to reach nearly 114 percent. What’s more, the levels of federal spending would average 24.5 percent of the nation’s economy for a decade.

Let’s put that in historical context. Biden’s budget blows beyond the massive government spending during WWII and FDR’s New Deal when public debt measured to economic output reached 106 percent in 1946. Let’s also not forget it was Vice President Biden who promised us that President Obama’s trillion dollar stimulus package and its “shovel-ready” projects would lead us out of recession. Now he’s pitching a $6 trillion spending spree that calls for this Iowa farmer to stick to his guns on fiscal discipline. Otherwise, this administration will hook up Uncle Sam’s fire hose to the U.S. Treasury and fuel the fires of inflation that harm lower-income families and seniors on fixed incomes the most. And that puts the Federal Reserve in a pickle to hike interest rates to keep the lid on inflation, which in turn, would increase the government’s borrowing costs, quickly spiraling our country even deeper into debt.

What’s missing from the president’s budget proposal?

Its detachment from fiscal reality is most glaring. Beyond that, President Biden ignored homegrown biofuels when he put his clean energy proposals on paper. Instead, he proposes massive spending to pump up the sales of electric vehicles (EV) in the United States, including directives for electrification of the federal fleet, from the U.S postal service to the USDA.

As a longstanding champion for alternative, renewable and homegrown energy, I’m disappointed the president shunned America’s biofuels as an environmentally friendly fuel additive that has helped America’s transportation fleet get motorists where they need to be and truckers deliver consumer products across the country with fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Americans expect policymakers to make realistic, reasonable decisions that protect consumer choice and strengthen U.S. energy security in an environmentally sustainable way. Energy policy also needs to take into account the livelihoods and local economies that would be impacted by pulling the plug on renewable and fossil fuels. Biden’s effectively putting America’s transportation energy eggs into one basket.

Even if all U.S. households could afford to kick their gasoline-powered cars to the curb and buy an EV car this very day, our nation’s energy grid needed to charge hundreds of millions of all-electric vehicles would take decades of development, installation and investment to meet demand. Last year 60 percent of electricity generation was from fossil fuels — coal, natural gas and petroleum. That means a majority of electric vehicles aren’t zero emissions at all and replace gasoline with other fossil fuels.

The president’s budget showers hundreds of billions of dollars into federal incentives for U.S. consumers to jump on the EV bandwagon, electrify school buses and install EV chargers across the country. Even that’s a gnat on the windshield when you factor in the heavy lift it would take to shift 250 million cars on the road to electric vehicles and install charging ports at homes, businesses and service stations across the U.S. First, Biden killed the Keystone XL Pipeline and recently suspended drilling leases in Alaska to appease climate activists. Now, his first budget ignores biofuels.

The administration also ignores the negative environmental impact created by lithium mining needed for EV batteries and power storage. As father of the federal wind energy program and champion for the Renewable Fuel Standard, I’ll continue pushing for an all-the-above energy strategy that strengthens U.S. energy security and independence without pulling the plug on entire sectors of the economy."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_730887,"As more states move towards auditing the state election results, let’s look back on what happened in Pennsylvania on election night and beyond.
This will hopefully convince you that Pennsylvania must audit its election results because quite frankly, the results stretch the human imagination and make for a seemingly impossible result.
On election night, President Trump was running away with the election in Pennsylvania as he led by an insurmountable lead of nearly 67-33% or about 750,000 votes in Trump’s favor.
The next day, Trump still led Joe Biden by 675,000 votes. On election day, Trump led in Pennsylvania by 2.7 million votes compared to Biden’s 1.4 million votes.  Then they began counting mail-in ballots but they were unable to say how many of them there were.
That is because they were not sure how many votes they would have to manufacture in order for Biden to win. On election day, Trump got nearly 2/3 of the vote and yet on the mail-in ballots.
Biden took 80% of the absentee ballots. That seems quite unbelievably high, bordering on the impossible.

The state allowed ballots to continue to come in for three days after the election. A court later ruled that it was illegal to accept votes that came in so late because it was against Pennsylvania state law. But for the certification process, those votes were counted. There was a court order that allowed Republican observers to watch the votes being counted but that was just another law the corrupt Democrats disregarded.

When we looked at these statistics we identified a pattern that is virtually mathematically impossible.  The President won two-thirds of the Election Day vote.  But with the basic exception of Philadelphia, the President won around 80% of the vote in each county in the state.  (See the blue line in the chart below showing the percent of total election day votes won by President Trump.)  Philadelphia is so large that it offsets these numbers and brings the President’s results down to around 65% of the state’s votes on Election Day.
What happened with the mail-in votes is almost statistically impossible (See the orange line below).  In almost every county throughout the state, the President was awarded a percentage of votes 40% less than the percent the President won on election day (see the grey line below).  If Trump won a county by 80% of the vote on Election Day, he won 40% of the mail-in vote for a county.  If the President won 60% of the vote on Election Day, he won 20% of the mail-in vote in another county.  This pattern occurred in almost every county with the only noticeable exception of Philadelphia, where the President only earned 30% of the vote on Election Day."

The draft report states that ""appropriate attention"" should be given to the potential damage alcohol can do to babies while still in the womb, and claims that in order to reduce the impacts, almost all women - not just those who are pregnant - should be prohibited from drinking.
Unsurprisingly, fury erupted following the announcement, with critics slamming the WHO for a 'completely disproportionate' and unrealistic approach to the problem.
Some even accused the organisation of sexism.
Colin Angus, an alcohol researcher from Sheffield University, said he would be ""amazed"" if the draft guidance goes through.
The WHO wants all women between 18-50 to be banned from drinking alcohol
""The suggestion that we should actively prevent a substantial proportion of women from drinking is completely at odds with the balance of the risks of drinking and restrictions on personal freedom that we see in almost any country in the world,"" Mr Angus told the Daily Mail.
""There are specific ethical issues around the fact that drinking in pregnancy has a detrimental effect on somebody other than the drinker - their unborn child.
""And the highest risk period for drinking is in the first few weeks of pregnancy when many women may not yet be aware they are pregnant.
""These risks need to be balanced with concerns about policing women's bodies and restricting their civil liberties.
'The suggestion we prevent women from drinking seems to me to be completely disproportionate.""
The WHO's plan aims to raise awareness of alcohol-related harm and its harmful use, but given public reaction, which anyone could have seen coming, they may want to have a rethink on strategy."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_497602,"Documents that Georgia's largest county submitted to state officials as part of a post-election audit highlight significant irregularities in the Atlanta area during last November's voting, ranging from identical vote tallies repeated multiple times to large batches of absentee ballots that appear to be missing from the official ballot-scanning records.
The problems in predominantly Democratic Fulton County potentially impact thousands of ballots in a presidential race that Joe Biden was certified as winning statewide by fewer than 12,000 votes.
The memos reviewed by Just the News include the handwritten tally sheets for all absentee ballots counted by the county as well as a private report from a contractor hired by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to monitor the Atlanta-area election process. The report, which chronicled seven days of problems, recorded troubling behavior like the mysterious removal of a suitcase of sensitive election data known as polls pads, used to authenticate voters.
""Learn that Rick reprogramming poll pads earlier was setting up a new precinct for SC11 because someone took the wrong suitcase but only took one,"" the contractor Seven Hills Strategy wrote late on Nov. 2, the night before Election Day. ""Seems to be a mystery who this person was --> Should have chain of custody paperwork!! That means that a stranger just walked out with sensitive election materials?""
The contractor also observed that sensitive election materials were left on a dock at a warehouse without supervision. ""Several cases (including SC11) were just left out on the loading dock outside the warehouse,"" he wrote. ""Thankfully the seals were intact.""
The revelations come as a state judge has taken the extraordinary step of ordering absentee ballots in the county unsealed so that a private audit led by lawyer Bob Cheeley can examine the actual papers and resolve discrepancies. Cheeley told Just the News on Wednesday the evidence he has seen so far points to ""election tabulation malpractice.""
Private experts and state election officials differ on whether the evidence shows a pattern of potential fraud or simply gross incompetence in the county that encompasses Atlanta.
But they are mostly united for the first time that the top election supervisors in Fulton County should be removed. Some officials are even discussing a dramatic intervention like putting the county's election system in conservatorship so it can be run by state, not local, officials.
""I have continued to call on the elections director to be removed from his position, and the leadership of Fulton County has continued to fail to act,"" Raffensperger told Just the News on Wednesday. 
The secretary said he stands by his private monitor's assessment that fraud did not occur at a scale in Fulton County to impact the election's outcome, but he added the county's election management failures nonetheless warrant dramatic repair.
""It is no secret that Fulton has had issues in their elections department for decades, which is why I insisted on a state monitor being present to be eyes and ears on the ground,"" he said. ""He did not see any evidence of fraud despite having full access, but he saw continued mismanagement, miscommunication, unpreparedness, and sloppiness. Georgia voters deserve better."" 
Fulton County election officials did not respond to repeated requests seeking comment.
Just the News reviewed the documents Raffensperger's office collected from Fulton County during a risk-limiting audit conducted last November. Among the problems those memos exposed:
More than 100 batches of absentee ballots — each containing approximately 100 or more ballots — were assigned tracking numbers before being sent to one of the five absentee vote-counting machines in Fulton County but are not subsequently recorded in the handwritten logs showing which batches were scanned and counted, raising concerns the ballots may be missing.
More than two dozen batches of absentee ballots were identified as having been double-scanned on the tally sheets.
Five sequential batches of absentee votes each appeared with the exact same vote count of 392 for Biden, 96 for President Donald Trump, and 3 for Libertarian Jo Jorgensen, a count that state officials admitted was a statistical impossibility.
Many control sheets for absentee ballot batches counted during the state's audit did not check a box indicating the ballot came from a secure container, raising the possibility that ballots were stored insecurely or that multiple batches of ballots were sealed in a single container.
An official working for Raffensperger, who reviewed the documents flagged by Just the News, said they were clear evidence of significant human failure in Fulton County's election administration. The official said, for instance, the identical ballot batches likely resulted in about 1,000 extra votes being tallied.
The official also said some of the gaps in the absentee ballots might be explained by mistakes in which county officials mixed absentee ballots counted by one machine for another. But he acknowledged other gaps in ballot batches defy immediate explanation and would require extensive investigation to determine if something more nefarious than incompetence was at work.
A second state official said the shoddy nature of the Fulton County paperwork left open the possibility fraud or other misconduct occurred. ""An audit is only as good as the data that's input, and in this case Fulton County's records are so problematic I'm not sure a reasonable person can trust them,"" the official said. ""When you add in the reports of ballots magically appearing under tables or being moved out of the counting center, there are legitimate outstanding questions.""
The findings of the Just the News review closely mirror those of the private audit conducted by Cheeley's team under the judge's supervision. 
A private fraud expert hired by Cheeley, the forensic accountant David Sawyer, specifically flagged scores of batches of absentee ballots that appeared missing from the documents and more than two dozen batches of absentee ballots that appear to have been double or triple-counted in Fulton County.
Sawyer said the fact that ballot batch numbers are missing from the Fulton County audit documents ""contradicts the concepts of completeness and existence and accuracy"" of the November audit, and ""should have been readily apparent to anyone who is performing a reconciliation, let alone an audit.""
""These need to be more fully investigated, and they indicate the possibility that there are missing batches that might not have been counted,"" Sawyer testified.
County lawyers who cross-examined Sawyer offered little explanation or pushback before the judge officially ordered all absentee ballots unsealed so Cheeley's team could investigate more deeply. That process is ongoing.
Cheeley told Just the News on Wednesday night his ongoing audit has now flagged many thousands of absentee ballots that haven't been properly accounted or suffer other serious problems.
""Fulton County's inability to account for so many batches reported from a November hand recount audit amounts to election tabulation malpractice,"" he said. ""Anyone who can count should know that is unacceptable. This evidence produced in court on May 21 justified the audit which Judge Amero ordered of the absentee ballots and envelopes."""

""It used to be thought that a university campus was a place where you'd be exposed to a lot of different ideas,"" DeSantis said, justifying the legislation. ""Unfortunately, now the norm is, these are more intellectually repressive environments. You have orthodoxies that are promoted, and other viewpoints are shunned or even suppressed.""

DeSantis didn't offer any specific examples of that repression but instead claimed he ""knows a lot of parents"" who are worried their children will be ""indoctrinated"" with ideas they don't support, and a pair of state legislators complained that Florida colleges and universities had become ""socialism factories.""

""As the governor said, we are at great risk, as a nation and as a state, on the lack of intellectual diversity that is on our university campuses,"" Sprowls said. ""We have decided that one ideological standard will win the day, but the thing is we're losing because we're not having real conversations.""
DeSantis and the bill's sponsor, state Sen. Ray Rodrigues (R-Estero), suggested funding could be cut as punishment for colleges and universities found to be ""indoctrinating"" students under the measure, which goes into effect July 1.

Rodrigues insisted that faculty would not be promoted or fired based on their political views recorded in the survey, which is not required to be filed anonymously, and will be selected or created by the state university system's Board of Governors and the State Board of Education.

DeSantis also signed a law prohibiting university and college officials from limiting campus speech that ""may be uncomfortable, disagreeable or offensive,"" and will allow students to record lectures without consent that may be used as evidence in a civil or criminal case against educational institutions."

OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR

EXECUTIVE ORDER NUMBER 21-175

(Ensuring Parents’ Freedom to Choose – Masks in Schools) 

WHEREAS, a right to normal education is imperative to the growth and development of our children and adolescents; and

WHEREAS, last summer, at my direction, Florida’s Department of Education ordered schools to be open for in-person instruction for five days per week to ensure the continued well-being of students and families; and

WHEREAS, schools – including those that did not require students to be masked – did not drive community transmission of COVID-19; and

WHEREAS, despite recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) “guidance,” forcing students to wear masks lacks a well-grounded scientific justification; indeed, a Brown University study analyzed COVID-19 data for schools in Florida and found no correlation with mask mandates; and

WHEREAS, masking children may lead to negative health and societal ramifications; and

WHEREAS, studies have shown that children are at a low risk of contracting a serious illness due to COVID-19 and do not play a significant role in the spread of the virus; and

WHEREAS, forcing children to wear masks could inhibit breathing, lead to the collection of dangerous impurities including bacteria, parasites, fungi, and other contaminants, and adversely affect communications in the classroom and student performance; and

WHEREAS, there is no statistically-significant evidence to suggest that counties with mask requirements have fared any better than those without mask requirements during the 2020-2021 school year; and

WHEREAS, on April 29, 2021, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Scott Rivkees issued a Public Health Advisory stating that continuing COVID-19 restrictions on individuals, including long-term use of face coverings, pose a risk of adverse and unintended consequences; and

WHEREAS, on June 29, 2021, I signed into law H.B. 241, the Parents’ Bill of Rights, which prevents the state, its subdivisions, or any governmental institution, from infringing on the fundamental rights of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, health care, or mental health of a minor child without demonstrating that such action is reasonable and necessary to achieve a compelling state interest and that such action is narrowly tailored and is not otherwise served by less restrictive means; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Florida law, all parents have the right to make health care decisions for their minor children; and

WHEREAS, many school districts are scheduled to begin classes on August 10, 2021, which is less than two weeks away, and within four weeks virtually all public schools across Florida will be underway; therefore immediate action is needed to protect the fundamental right of parents to make health and educational decisions for their children; and

WHEREAS, Section 1003.22(3), Florida Statutes, mandates the Florida Department of Health to adopt rules, in consultation with the Florida Department of Education, governing the control of preventable communicable diseases, including procedures for exempting children from immunization requirements; and

WHEREAS, Florida’s State Board of Education, the chief implementing and coordinating body of public education in Florida, has the authority to adopt rules pursuant to Sections 120.536(1), 120.54, and 1001.02, Florida Statutes, and may delegate its general powers to the Commissioner of Education; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 1008.32(4), Florida Statutes, if the State Board of Education determines that a district school board is unwilling or unable to comply with the law, the State Board shall have the authority to, among other things, withhold the transfer of state funds, discretionary grant funds, discretionary lottery funds, or any other funds specified as eligible for this purpose by the Legislature until the school district complies with the law or state board rule and declare the school district ineligible for competitive grants; and

WHEREAS, given the historical data on COVID-19 and the ongoing debate over whether masks are more harmful than beneficial to children and to school environments in general, we should protect the freedoms and statutory rights of students and parents by resting with the parents the decision whether their children should wear masks in school; and

WHEREAS, we should equally and uniformly protect the freedoms and rights of students and parents across the state.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, Ron DeSantis, as Governor of Florida, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Article IV, Section 1(a) of the Florida Constitution, and all other applicable laws, promulgate the following Executive Order, to take immediate effect:

Section 1.        I hereby direct the Florida Department of Health and the Florida Department of Education, working together, to immediately execute rules pursuant to section 120.54, Florida Statutes, and take any additional agency action necessary, using all legal means available, to ensure safety protocols for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in schools that:

Do not violate Floridians’ constitutional freedoms;
Do not violate parents’ right under Florida law to make health care decisions for their minor children; and
Protect children with disabilities or health conditions who would be harmed by certain protocols such as face masking requirements.
Section 2.        Any action taken pursuant to Section 1 above shall at minimum be in accordance with Florida’s “Parents’ Bill of Rights” and protect parents’ right to make decisions regarding masking of their children in relation to COVID-19.

Section 3.        The Florida Commissioner of Education shall pursue all legal means available to ensure school districts adhere to Florida law, including but not limited to withholding state funds from noncompliant school boards violating any rules or agency action taken pursuant to Section 1 above.

Section 4.        This does not prohibit the Florida Legislature from exploring legislation to further protect the fundamental rights of students and parents to be free from excessive, harmful regulation in schools.

Section 5.        This Executive Order is effective immediately.

Politifact_FALSE_Press release_645229,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott released a weekly update on his actions to address America’s debt crisis and rising inflation. As the wasteful, reckless spending of the Biden administration and congressional Democrats leads to growing inflation and rising prices of every day goods, Senator Scott is urging the president to end his failed economic policies and address rising inflation on American families.

This week, Senator Rick Scott spoke on the Senate floor on how Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree is causing rising inflation and hurting American families. Senator Scott also led several of his colleagues in a press conference today on how Congress can work to get government spending under control, including passing his Federal Debt Emergency Control Act to require that two-thirds of the Senate vote to increase the debt before approving any bill with deficit spending, and his amendment to the Senate Rules to require that all committee reports include inflationary impact statements so Americans can see the true impacts of government spending.

Senator Rick Scott said, “Biden and the Democrats say they care about Americans – but they have done absolutely nothing to help families struggling to keep up with inflation. We are nearly $30 TRILLION in debt, but Democrats have no plans to slow down their spending. Now, Biden and the Democrats want to spend another $5.5 trillion on their liberal priorities, with no consideration to how this might impact families. Their message to the American people is clear: they don’t care about inflation. They don’t care that their reckless spending is causing prices to skyrocket. If that’s the cost of getting their liberal wish list, so be it. It’s time to wake up and take action to get government spending under control – our children and grandchildren are depending on it.”

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_561430,"A group of highly trained US military veterans have been conducting secret rescue missions behind the Biden State Department’s back, rescuing hundreds of Afghan allies from Afghanistan with their heroic efforts.
Furious over the terrible situation in they had already sacrificed so much to prevent when they served, the team of retired specialists, including Green Berets and Navy SEALS, risked their lives. They volunteered to travel to Kabul because they were afraid that Joe Biden was abandoning at-risk Afghan elite forces, leaving them to die at the hands of terrorists.
They felt it was necessary for someone to step up and were baffled  “that our own government didn’t do this,” former Navy SEAL Jason Redman told ABC.
“We did what we should do, as Americans,” he said.
“I just want to get my people out” – Maj. Jim Gant, a retired Green Beret also told ABC
The operation started about a week ago and was called “pineapple express.” Team members used images of pineapples on their phones to communicate who they were and would usually smuggle people into the airfield in the dead of night.
The rogue team also used “pineapple express” as a password that was given to US military members who denied their orders to assist the veterans when they brought people to the airfield.
They had been operating until Thursday morning, when some of their team were among those injured in the suicide bombing near the airport that killed over 180, including 13 US Military members. 
According to New York Post:
ABC said some Pineapple Express travelers were injured in the terror attack, and the group was still assessing whether any were among the more than 180 killed.
Some of those rescued said they witnessed people just inches away from them being killed, while others refused to leave unless their family members were also evacuated.
We pray for their safe and full recovery. If any of them were among those killed, their blood is on Biden’s hands.
The heroic team started with the goal to rescue an ex-Afghan commando that was under imminent threat from the Taliban for having worked with US military forces in the past. They were able to get him and his family safely out of danger.
After that mission was a success, they waded through sewers and used satellite imagery to avoid dozens of Taliban checkpoints so they could covertly smuggle people to the airport.
Their courageous efforts have enabled 630 people to safely get to their evacuation flights out of Afghanistan. 
The volunteer unit was commanded by Lt. Col. Scott Mann, a retired Green Beret commander. He explained how the team was proud to have risked their lives to save “dozens of high-risk individuals, families with small children, orphans, and pregnant women.”
He explained to ABC: “This Herculean effort couldn’t have been done without the unofficial heroes inside the airfield who defied their orders to not help beyond the airport perimeter, by wading into sewage canals and pulling in these targeted people who were flashing pineapples on their phones.” 
These brave heroes had already sacrificed so much fighting in Afghanistan so the Taliban could not continue their evil reign of terror. The last thing they should have to do is go back into a hostile war zone to rescue people that have been left behind by the Commander in Chief. 
These men deserve to be accommodated and recognized for their amazing strength and resolve. Thank You!

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_895897,"New Orleanians who fled their homes ahead of Hurricane Ida’s terrifying wrath and later tried to return to salvage keepsakes and mementoes met unwelcome visitors along the treacherous stretch of road, highway 610, just south of Lake Pontchartrain.
At an intersection due east of Metairie, sat four amphibious vehicles with FEMA logos stenciled on either side of the carriage. Beside the vehicles, armed FEMA agents peered through binoculars, watching for persons braving the deluge. Next to them, two CDC personnel handled a cooler brimming with Covid-19 vaccinations.
Dennis Farrell, a New Orleans native, and his son Chris had been traversing the perilous stretch of road when he spotted the curious roadblock ahead of his GMC Yukon. He knew that Louisiana’s Governor, John Bell Edwards, had ordered evacuees to avoid the city at all costs, citing flooding, downed power lines, scorching heat, lack of potable water, and potential death as his gravest concerns.
But at the hotel where Mr. Farrell had been staying, he had heard other Ida refugees discussing ignoring the governor’s mandate because roving bands of looters reportedly had been pillaging the city and plundering washed-out homes and businesses.
Mr. Farrell was concerned because he had left behind a locked gun cabinet and his wife’s jewelry box, and he sought to recover those items before they fell into criminal hands. So early Tuesday morning he and his son took to the road in hopes of recovering the valuables—until FEMA stopped them in their tracks.
FEMA, Mr. Farrell told Real Raw News, intercepted his Yukon and demanded he and his son exit the vehicle.
“They weren’t concerned for our safety or anything. Those guys had their hands on their rifles while the CDC folks hung behind them. First thing they asked me was if me and Chris had gotten the Covid-19 shot, and if so, to show them our vaccination cards,” Mr. Farrell said.
When Mr. Farrell admitted neither he nor his son had gotten a vaccination, the FEMA agents became combative and belligerent, and admonished them for “putting their friends and family at risk by not taking the shot like patriotic Americans do.” Mr. Farrell told FEMA he didn’t trust the vaccine, citing rushed development and safety an efficacy concerns, and that his family was in excellent health, with no comorbidities, and at little risk of dying from a virus with a 99.6% survival rate.
“They told me my stupidity was a comorbidity,” Mr. Farrell said.
The agents, Mr. Farrell added, had “great” news for him; fortunately, they had a cooler full of Covid-19 vaccinations, and CDC medical technicians on hand to administer those vaccinations.
“They told me there was a massive Delta outbreak going around New Orleans and they weren’t letting people back without proof of the shot or getting the shot right then and there. When I told them I didn’t want my property looted, they told me if my valuables got stolen, it’d be a small price to pay compared to the damage I might cause by spreading Covid around the community. They said if I wanted to pass, I had to take their shot. If I didn’t, I’d have to turn around,” Mr. Farrell said.

UPDATE: Champion show jumper, 22, who suffered extremely reaction to Moderna vaccine may never ride again as two massive blood clots formed on her lungs after she had Covid jab. This is how the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine ruined the career of a future detective with two massive blood clots on her lungs.

A six-week-old breastfeeding baby became inexplicably ill with a high fever after his mother received a COVID-19 vaccine and he died weeks later with blood clots in his “severely inflamed arteries,” according to a vaccine adverse event report filed with the U.S. government.

An unidentified 36-year-old woman from New Mexico said she received a first dose of Pfizer’s Covid-19 jab on June 4, 2021 when she was breastfeeding her six-week-old infant son, according to a report (archive link) filed with the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

Democrats and no selected party votes made up a whopping 73.8% of the votes or 63,757 ballots total. Not selecting a party makes monitoring of nefarious registrations nearly impossible to verify.
Even the new registration forms include only three categories, R, D, and other.

Cyber Ninjas used Melissa Personator which is arguably the best program for confirmation of the citizenship of Americans and Canadians. It searches various databases including USPS and the Social Security databases.
Since Social Security lists everyone’s name, DOB, SS#, and addresses, there is no reason why legitimate voters cannot be found using the program. All voters should be readily listed except for the possible exceptions of illegal aliens.

Remember, these numbers are in addition to the 50,000 plus duplicate votes. They make no consideration the database might have been manipulated, but know it was hacked on Nov. 5th, 2020.

From The Gateway Pundit
In March 2017 the new Maricopa Recorder disclosed that tens of thousands of unprocessed voter registration forms were sitting in stacked boxes in their office. Helen Purcell (Republican) had been the Recorder up to this point and was replaced 2 months earlier by Democrat activist Adrian Fontes. These boxes were voter applicants who couldn’t provide proof of U.S. citizenship or identity. They were notified by mail to provide additional documentation and the forms had been held indefinitely. Why?
Arizona’s Prop 200 was passed in 2004. To register to vote, citizens were now required to provide proof of U.S. citizenship and identity. Arizona changed its State registration form to accommodate the new law. Democrats resisted and started using the Federal Voter Registration Form, which doesn’t require proof of U.S. citizenship. In 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that AZ must accept this Federal Form. However, those voters would only receive ballots that list Federal candidates – President and Congress. These are classified as “Federal Only” voters in AZ. It’s bullshit. Democrats exclusively use the Fed Form in AZ to bypass citizenship and other ID issues.
Voter registrations between the 2018 and the 2020 elections jumped by an unbelievable 13.1. That’s 340,676 new voter registrations in just 2 years. That is unheard of in a state the size of Arizona."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_677339,"Another piece US anti-Ivermectin puzzle may have emerged. On Monday, Pfizer announced that it's launching an accelerated Phase 2/3 trial for a COVID prophylactic pill designed to ward off COVID in those may have come in contact with the disease.
Coincidentally (or not), Pfizer's drug shares at least one mechanism of action as Ivermectin - an anti-parasitic used in humans for decades, which functions as a protease inhibitor against Covid-19, which researchers speculate ""could be the biophysical basis behind its antiviral efficiency.""
Lo and behold, Pfizer's new drug - which some have jokingly dubbed ""Pfizermectin,"" is described by the pharmaceutical giant as a ""potent protease inhibitor.""

As Zero Hedge readers might recognize, that's exactly what ivermectin, the prophylactic used for a number of reasons in both humans and animals, does. And unlike Pfizer's experimental drug, ivermectin already may have saved hundreds of thousands of lives from India to Brazil.
We aren't the only ones to have put this together, as twitter users have commented on the similarities. The timing - which coincides with the whole ""horse dewormer"" smear campaign - just seems odd.
The similarity between Pfizer's upcoming offering and Ivermectin has not gone unnoticed.

But Pfizer, Moderna and their executives have already shown the world with their actions that they see COVID as ""manna from heaven"" - to quote legendary defense attorney Johnny Cochran -  a new 'profit center' that will keep shareholders in butter brickle, especially since the companies have quietly raised prices on their vaccines.

But since a large portion of the American market has rejected the vaccines, Pfizer needs another medication that can be used to treat them as well (otherwise, the company is missing out on nearly one-third of the American market).
According to Reuters, Pfizer said on Monday it has ""started a large study testing its investigational oral antiviral drug for the prevention of COVID-19 infection among those who have been exposed to the virus.""
Pfizer isn't the only drugmaker hoping to develop a prophylactic treatment for COVID exposure (especially since variants raise the possibility that vaccinations just might not be enough). Merck and Swiss rival Roche have been racing to develop an easy-to-administer antiviral pill of their own - so the clock is ticking for Pfizer.
Reuters explains that the mid-to-late-stage study will test the Pfizer drug's - known as PF-07321332 ability to prevent COVID symptoms in up to 2,660 healthy adult participants aged 18 and older who live in the same household as an individual with a confirmed symptomatic COVID infection.
The drug, designed to block the activity of a key enzyme needed for the coronavirus to multiply inside the human body, will be administered along with a low dose of ritonavir, an older medication widely used in combination treatments for HIV infection.
At present, Gilead's much-hyped but not-all-that-effective IV drug remdesivir is the only approved antiviral treatment for COVID in the US. Several antibody cocktails have also been widely tested and trials are ongoing - including Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, which recently launched a late-stage trial for experimental COVID prophylactic, molnupiravir.
In the mean time, concerned citizens should keep an eye out for any new information about Ivermectin - if you can find it."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_139440,"Are you aware that Australia is currently in the grip of dictatorial tyranny due to a handful of Covid-19 deaths occurring every day? What’s happening in that country has absolutely nothing to do with a virus, and everything to do with control, and you only need to look at what’s going on in the United Kingdom to confirm that.

Because the latest Public Health data shows that Covid-19 vaccinated people have accounted for 81% of Covid-19 deaths this summer, whilst UK Government data shows that Covid-19 deaths are over 11 times higher than this time last year, and Office for National Statistics data shows that since teens were first given the Covid-19 vaccine there has been a 63% increase in deaths among teen boys compared to the same period in 2020.

The UK is essentially in the midst of a national disaster with a vaccine programme that has clearly failed, but more worryingly has also killed children, and will kill more. because we seem to have a problem in the UK where a huge majority of the population do not believe a single thing unless it is shown on the BBC News.

But the data could not be more clear. Just take a look at Public Health Scotland’s latest Covid-19 Statistical report published September 29th. Table 18 of the report shows that the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths between August 21st and September 17th 2021 were among the fully vaccinated population with 233 deaths recorded, accounting for 77% of all Covid-19 deaths.

Throw in the 10 deaths to have occurred among the partly vaccinated and that means the vaccinated population accounted for 81% of Covid-19 deaths in Scotland between August 21st and September 17th.


Source
UK Health Security Agency (the sinister replacement for Public Health England) data doesn’t look much better either. Table 4 of the report published by UKHSA shows that there were 687 deaths among the unvaccinated, 110 deaths among the partly vaccinated, but a frightening 2,338 deaths among the fully vaccinated between August 30th and September 26th 2021.


Source – Page 16
This means that the unvaccinated account for just 22% of Covid-19 deaths during September 2021, whilst the vaccinated account for a disastrous 78%.

And don’t even attempt to argue that this is normal because the majority of the adult population have allegedly been vaccinated. If this were normal then how do you explain the fact that Covid-19 deaths are over twelve times higher than the same period last year when there wasn’t a Covid-19 vaccine available?

With only a claimed 95% effectiveness (The latest UKHSA data actually shows the vaccines have a negative efficacy as low as MINUS 66 percent), you would of course expect to still see some Covid-19 deaths. But not when seasonality should be on our side, just like it was in 2020 when deaths dropped to nearly zero.

Mix seasonality in with an effective vaccine and you would have thought the UK would have just enjoyed a Covid-19 free summer, but the reality has been far from it.


The above numbers are what you would expect to see in the middle of winter with an effective vaccine, not the middle of summer.

But as if having a Covid-19 vaccination programme which is proving to not only not work, but also make the recipients of the jabs much worse, wasn’t bad enough, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty decided that he wouldn’t accept the decision made by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, and overruled them because he clearly wants to kill children.

Just like he helped to kill the elderly and vulnerable with a blanket policy of Do Not Resuscitate orders being used as an excuse to start end of life care which involved starving and dehydrating the patients whilst overdosing them on a drug called Midazolam, that is known to cause the same symptoms as serious disease due to Covid-19.

It’s too soon to tell if children have already died due to Chris Whitty’s decision to offer them an experimental leaky Covid-19 injection, but official Office for National Statistics data does show us that teens over the age of 15 have already seen a significant rise in deaths since they started to be given the Covid-19 vaccine.

The 2020 edition of ‘Deaths registered weekly in England and Wales’, which can be downloaded here, and accessed on the ONS website here, shows that between the week ending 8th May 2020 and the week ending 18th September 2020, a total of 219 deaths occurred among 15 – 19-year-olds. Of these 142 deaths were among teenage boys, whilst 77 deaths were among teenage girls.


Whereas the 2021 editions of ‘Deaths registered weekly in England and Wales, which can be downloaded here, and accessed on the ONS website here, shows that between the week ending 7th May 2021 and the week ending 17th September 2021, a total of 320 deaths occurred among 15 – 19-year-olds. Of these 231 deaths were among teenage boys, whilst 89 deaths were amongst teenage girls.


This shows that the number of deaths between May 7th 2021 and September 17th 2021 among teens aged 15 and over were 46% higher than the number of deaths in this age group during the same period in 2020, and the increase in deaths began at precisely the same time teens started receiving the Covid-19 vaccine.


Source – Page 82 (older age groups removed for clarity)
But what this also shows is that since the Covid-19 vaccines began being given to teens over the age of 15, deaths among teenage boys have increased by 63%, whereas deaths among teenage girls have still increased, but at a much lower rate of just 16%.

We compiled the following table of ONS figures so that we were able to easily compare the number of deaths per week among teens over the age of 15 separated into males and females.


Source – ONS 2020 + 2021 datasets
The largest increase in male teen deaths came in the week ending September 3rd 2021 which saw a 700% increase in male teen deaths, but just a 17% increase in female teen deaths.

We were also able to discover from the table above that deaths in male teens have seen a significant increase in 17 of the 20 weeks since a sizeable amount of teens started getting the Covid-19 vaccine, with the remaining 3 weeks registering a 0% increase, a -45% decrease, and a -22% decrease registered in the week ending 17th September.

Whereas deaths among female teens only saw an increase on the previous year in 8 of the 20 weeks since this age group began receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. Five of the 20 weeks saw a 0% increase in deaths on the previous year, whilst 7 of the 20 weeks actually saw a percentage decrease in the number of deaths registered compared to the previous year.

We carried out a full investigation of the above data on Teen deaths which can be viewed here, which clearly shows correlation with emergency calls requesting an ambulance due to cardiac arrest rising to an all time high against the expected level.

When you consider that myocarditis, a condition which causes inflammation of the heart muscle and can lead to cardiac arrest, has been officially added to the safety label of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines, and is known to occur much more often in males, it’s not hard to work out what’s happening here.

The problem is that it shouldn’t be us, and us alone who are seeing this. The British taxpayer funds several public institutions including the ONS, UKHSA (formerly PHE) , and MHRA (UK Medicine Regulator) which are supposed to be actively monitoring all of this data and looking for warning signs.

Which leaves us with three possible answers –

They’re too stupid to see what’s happening
They’re not looking
They don’t care, and are quite happy to kill Teenagers and Children
81% of Covid-19 deaths are among the vaccinated, Covid-19 deaths are over twelve times higher than this time last year, and deaths among Teen Boys have risen by 63% since they started to get the Covid-19 vaccine, yet the United Kingdom is just carrying on as normal as if none of this is actually happening.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_548119,"In August 2020, we wrote about Bill Gates after an unearthed video showed him talking about using new vaccines for population control. However, it didn’t take long before the fact-checkers called the video misinformation and fake news.

Fast forward a little over a year later, AP now confirmed the existence of the video. In a piece titled, “Bill Gates said health care and vaccines could reduce unsustainable population growth in a 2010 TED Talk, fact-checkers say,” Reuters, the Associated Press, and FactCheck.org, now confirmed what we’ve been saying all along.

Here is how Reuters explained the story:

“Gates was referring to the reduction of population growth, not the reduction of the population by 10 or 15%.”

The Associated Press describes it this way:

“The billionaire philanthropist has spoken about the benefits of slowing the rate of population growth, but he has not advocated killing people.”

But what did Bill Gates really say? At a 2010 TED Talk about reducing carbon emissions, Gates said that one of the factors contributing to high levels of carbon emissions is population growth and that better health care could help lower unsustainable population growth.

Gates said in a 2010 TED Talk “Innovating to zero!” that improving public health using vaccinations can reduce unsustainable population growth, and with it, lower carbon emissions.” Gates’ remark was part of a larger strategy to slow down population growth in order to reduce CO2 emissions. During the 2010 TED talk presentation, Gates also shared a mathematical formula that he believes could one day solve the climate change problem we are facing.

CO2 (carbon dioxide output) = P x S x E x C (= People x Services per Person x Energy per Service x CO2 per unit of Energy).

Looking at this from a larger context of the speech, Gates is talking about the need to reduce CO2 emissions by humans and he presents this formula for calculating how big these emissions are. Gates’s formula supports the mathematical rule that to get something to zero by multiplying you have to multiply it by zero.

The “P” in the formula stands for People. Gates is advocating for a reduction in the number of people on the planet “by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent using new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services. Rather than misrepresent what Mr. Gates said and take him out of context, below is the entire video and exact quotes from Mr. Gates.

“First, we’ve got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent …”

Could this probably explain why Bill Gates and his foundation have spent $4.3 billion to vaccinate 80 million children in third world countries? Shouldn’t sufficient food supply and clean drinking water be the first priority? What good is a healthy immune system if you’re going to die of starvation or be poisoned by your water?

Some experts object to Gates’s mathematical formula. For example, Professor Hans Rosling shows that people living in poverty have many children. Poor families suffer from high child mortality, and the largest population growth occurs where people are poor.  He said saving poor children is an important factor in ending both poverty and population growth. He went on to say that the death of children is not holding back population growth. It is one of the reasons poor people still have many children.

Below is a video of Bill Gates’s presentation in 2010. Watch and listen to the video very carefully and draw your own conclusion.

It was a disastrous weekend for Southwest Airlines. Across Saturday and Sunday, they canceled more than 2,100 flights, about a quarter of their total. Now here’s where it gets interesting: It’s extremely obvious someone is lying about why. In a statement, Southwest blamed bad weather and air traffic control problems. But the Federal Aviation Administration says, no, there haven’t been any air traffic control issues since last Friday. And if “Bad weather” was forcing cancellations, it was a peculiar kind of weather that only affected Southwest and its airplanes. Other airlines didn’t have mass cancellations. There was some rain and thunderstorms in Florida, but no hurricanes. Nothing that required a mass shutdown.
No, somebody is lying here. And it could be from both Southwest and the FAA. There are reports that in Jacksonville, Florida, air traffic controllers walked off the job to protest against vaccine mandates. But that might not be all. Southwest announced a vaccine mandate for all personnel last week, and there are reports that pilots are joining the resistance as well. But Southwest’s pilot’s union claims there is no such protest action underway; they say that “poor planning” by Southwest management caused the cancellations.

Politifact_FALSE_Social media_760631,"Amazing! Fluoride is so safe that if applied to your skin, it will burn right through it. It also can rip right through metal! So why not put some in our drinking water?
.
Is this not absolutely preposterous?
.
It’s important to understand that the forms of fluoride added to the water supply are NOT natural.
.
Fluoridation of water started almost 60 years ago because at the time people thought it helped prevent tooth decay. Today, the United States is 1 of only 8 countries that supplies over 50% of its population with fluoridated water. Think something is up here?
.
The Lancet has defined fluoride as neurotoxic, and can play a role in developmental disabilities and is linked to lowered one’s IQ.

.
There are also studies that show increases in the development of osteosarcoma in boys who drink fluoridated water during their childhood. 
.
In fact, it has gotten so concerning that 98% of Europe, China, India, and Japan do not fluoridate their water at all.
.
There are two forms of fluoride that end up in our water: sodium fluorosilicate and fluorosilicic acid. Both of these are by-products of the refining and fertilizer industries. These are so toxic that the CDC clearly labels these chemicals extremely toxic in both animals and humans. So why not put it in our drinking water?!
.
We are able to excrete about 50% of the fluoride we ingest through urine. The rest gets stored in our bones and pineal gland! The pineal gland is extremely important for releasing the antioxidant, anticancer, and sleep regulating hormone, melatonin.
.
Since the 1970s, tooth decay rates have declined in both countries that have and have not fluoridated their water at similar rates, according to the WHO.
.
This is a known poison that we add to the drinking water, where we slowly consume low-grade doses of it daily. Think about it: a pea sized amount of toothpaste has 0.3mg of fluoride. A 16oz glass of water has 0.5mg.
.
Why is there a warning saying to call poison control if we swallow more than we use to brush?

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_81380,"In a podcast episode released last Tuesday, New York Times best-selling author, Alex Berenson, who was permanently suspended from Twitter, appeared on “The Joe Rogan Experience” to discuss the latest reports on the COVID vaccines out of the UK.
Berenson showed Rogan a report entitled “COVID-19 Vaccine Surveillance Report Week 38” from Public Health England (PHE), which is equivalent to the Center for Disease Control in the United States. He pointed to the fact that the British Government’s own data shows the majority of COVID cases and deaths occurred in the fully vaccinated during the month of September, or more specifically, between the weeks of 34 and 37 2021. Berenson said:
“I have to keep saying this to people because they almost don’t believe it. In the UK, more than 70% of the people who die now from COVID are fully vaccinated.”
According to Table 4 from the PHE Report, during the month of September, there were a total of 3,158 COVID deaths in England. PHE defines deaths as occurring “within 28 days of a positive specimen (COVID-19 test) or COVID-19 reported on death certificate”. And, they define fully vaccinated as “14-days or more after the second dose of a 2-dose vaccine”. In total, 2,284 of the 3,158 total COVID deaths in England for the month of September were fully vaccinated. In other words, 72.32% of COVID-19 deaths in England during September were fully vaccinated.

Berenson continued, “I’m going to keep saying it because nobody believes it, but the numbers are there in the government documents. They are not a secret. It’s not a conspiracy theory. It’s not somebody saying I heard this from my cousin. It’s in British government documents.”
“What I want everyone to see,” he said. “Is that the vast majority of people in Britain who died in September were fully vaccinated. Those are the numbers.” Berenson also discussed England’s “case rates by vaccination status” featured in Table 2 of the same PHE Report. Berenson said:
“This is UK Government data and what it says is that the idea that it is a ‘pandemic of the unvaccinated’ is a total lie. You are more likely to become sick if you are vaccinated than if you are not if you are older than 40.”

According to Table 2, during September, there were a total of 256,686 cases recorded for people above the age of 40. In total, 205,197 of the 256,686 cases in England during September were fully vaccinated. More specifically, 79.94% of the COVID-19 cases in England above the age of 40 during September were fully vaccinated. Furthermore, for those 40 and older, the average rate of COVID-19 per 100,000 was higher in the fully vaccinated at 724 per 100,000 compared to the unvaccinated at 520 per 100,000. This means in England during the month of September, if you were 40 or older, you were more likely to catch COVID-19 if you were vaccinated, rather than if you were unvaccinated.

The rate of cases per 100,000 classified by age group and vaccination status can be better visualized with Figure 2 from the same PHE Report. Note, the 40 and older age groups, where the fully vaccinated (blue) have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 than the unvaccinated (pink). Now, on the other hand, for those 39 and below, according to this data, the unvaccinated have a higher chance of contracting COVID-19, but considering the 10,000-fold difference in mortality rates between the old and the young, high COVID-19 rates in people under the age of 40 is exponentially less of a risk of hospitalization and death compared to high COVID-19 rates among the elderly. For example, according to the UK Government, between March 2020 and January 2021, 436 of 80,820 total COVID-19 deaths were 39 and below, representing half of one percent of the countries deaths, while the median age of death was 82 and the mean age of death was 80.

Alex Berenson came on the “Joe Rogan Experience” as it is now established fact across the medical community that these vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission. They are by definition “leaky vaccines”. In other words, they are vaccines that lower the chance of severe illness but still allow for infection and transmission of the virus. The real revelations here are the extent of cases and deaths occurring in the fully vaccinated in England during the month of September. How is it possible that public health officials and media pundits in the United States continue to call it a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” when 72.32% of COVID deaths in England occurred in the fully vaccinated last month? Why is no one in the mainstream media acknowledging the United Kingdom’s publicly available data showing for the 40 and older age groups, 79.94% of COVID-19 cases in England during September were fully vaccinated?
There is simply no way that England has completely contradictory data to the United States with the same virus and vaccines. Similar patterns to Public Health England’s data can be found in other countries around the world. For example, data from Israel, Iceland, and Singapore also show the majority of COVID cases in the fully vaccinated. In summary, U.S. public health and political officials with the help of corporate media outlets are lying, manipulating, and deceiving the American public. Meanwhile, an independent journalist like Alex Berenson will continue to seek out publicly available data from foreign nations to hold U.S. officials accountable.
In contrast, the fact-checkers at Reuters, the Associated Press, and the New York Times will debunk these statements by saying that the majority of people over the age of 40 are fully vaccinated in England, therefore it is to be expected that the majority of COVID-19 deaths would be fully vaccinated. Which does not change the fact that 72.32% of COVID deaths in England last month were fully vaccinated. Nor, does it debunk the fact that, if you are above the age of 40, you are more likely to catch COVID-19 if you are vaccinated rather than if you are unvaccinated according to this report from Public Health England.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_406753,"Barack Obama has signaled not-so-subtly that the Democrats fully intend to cheat in the Virginia governor’s election. In front of a modest crowd at a ticketed event at Virginia Commonwealth University, the former president endorsed gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe and emphasized repeatedly that voters can cast their ballots for him in the mail or at drop boxes.

“Before we start anything else, I want to remind you and everybody who’s watching, you don’t have to wait until November 2nd to cast your ballot,” he said. “You can vote early, right now. Either by mail or in person.”

“Don’ be lollygalling [sic],” he said. “Don’t be, don’t be sitting on the couch saying, ‘I’ll get to it later.’ You can vote early right now. If you get a ballot at home, you can return it by mail. Or you can hand it in at your local registrar’s office. Or you can take it to a drop-off location today. Don’t leave it on your desk.”
“Millions of Virginians voted early next year,” he added. “Let’s do it again this year.”
Terry McAuliffe, ex-DNC Chair and former Virginia Governor, is running neck-in-neck with Glenn Youngkin, a political newcomer, after once coasting at a comfortable lead. The latest Monmouth polling on the race show both are drawing about 46 percent, indicating that there are few undecideds. However, independents are late-breaking types and the longer McAuliffe and Youngkin are in a political heat, the higher the likelihood that independents may tilt for Youngkin.
Ahead of the speaking event, turnout at Virginia Commonwealth University appeared to be modest. It wasn’t Joe Biden-level paltry, but it was underwhelming nonetheless. The speakers at the event included Governor Ralph Northam, former presidential candidate Tim Kaine, Terry McAuliffe and Barack Obama himself.

“Just hours before the event, the former president endorsed 21 other Virginia Democrats running for office,” WAVY also reported. For comparison, this is what a Barack Obama rally looked like in May 2012:

Youngkin is also holding a statewide bus tour today with stops in Hanover, Richmond, Midlothian and Glenn Allen, the report added.
While dozens of McAuliffe organizers and supporters turned out, many of them without masks, the Democratic Party continues to act like the coronavirus pandemic is stopping a significant number of voters from going to polling places in-person. The same Virginians that go to supermarkets and Virginia University home football games are being treated as if voting is a special case requiring no-excuse mass absentee ballots, which have been shown repeatedly to cause serious questions about election integrity and the validity of election results.
As WRIC reported, Virginia implemented ballot drop boxes in 2020 amidst the surging coronavirus pandemic.

“Gov. Ralph Northam (D) signed legislation in early September to allow localities to have ballot drop boxes inside and outside local registrar’s offices, at satellite voting sites and polling locations on Election Day,” WRIC reported.
“Before the measure was passed, Virginia Democrats stressed that the boxes would provide a secure alternative for voters to drop off their ballots without having to mail them or going to the post office while Republican lawmakers argued that the drop boxes could create opportunities for voter fraud,” the report added.
The election regulations provided to 8News show that the security of the ballots is far from ideal.
“The standards, which were provided to 8News, state that localities can decide whether to have a secure drop box or one monitored by a staff member,” the report said. “Secure drop boxes ‘must be constructed of durable material able to withstand vandalism, removal, and inclement weather, and be securely fastened to prevent moving or tampering’ and a video surveillance system must monitor them.”
“Staffed locations do not need to use a drop box, and instead may have ballots placed into either 1) a container placed behind a counter; or 2) a portable container that can be transported to a curbside or mobile voting area,” the Virginia Department of Elections stated. Absentee ballots dropped off inside the boxes will be collected at least twice a day “by two officers of election representing the two major political parties,” the department added.
A Capitol Research Center report on the 2020 elections updated in May 2021 shows the extensive interference in the Virginia election that was caused by drop boxes funded by the Mark Zuckerberg-backed Center for Technology and Civic Life (CTCL).
“Many Americans now know that Facebook founder and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg interfered in the 2020 election, pouring $350 million into an obscure Chicago-based nonprofit that redistributed the funds to county elections officials nationwide. What they might not know is just how widespread those grants were,” the Capital Research Center said.
“Meet the Center for Technology and Civic Life (CTCL), a group that burst into prominence after Zuckerberg increased the tiny nonprofit’s revenues—just $1.4 million in 2018—by a bewildering 24,900 percent in the lead-up to the 2020 election. CTCL used its newfound fortune to funnel five-, six-, seven-, even eight-figure grants to the government officials responsible for administering the 2020 election—with devastating results for Republicans,” the report continued.
“Now we’ve traced nearly $4 million from CTCL to Virginia, a state Democrats have eagerly colonized from their holdfast in Washington, DC, transforming the once reliable Republican Old Dominion into a leftist stronghold,” the report added. “In the spirit of disclosure—and because CTCL has not yet publicly disclosed its grant data—CRC has released its data for viewing here.”
The CRC then digs into the specific impact that Zuckerberg boxes played in the 2020 election. It is worth noting in detail.
“So what role did CTCL play in the Old Dominion? Virginia was always expected to be firmly in Biden’s grip, so the question isn’t whether CTCL funding flipped the state but rather how much its grants aided turnout in Democratic-leaning counties,” the CRC said. “A list of ‘preliminary grants‘ discovered online notes 38 counties and cities in Virginia that evidently received funding from CTCL. Of these, CRC has uncovered $3,968,221 in grants flowing to 38 Virginia counties and cities (including one not listed in CTCL’s preliminary document), leaving at least one more jurisdiction (Hanover County) that almost certainly received some money from the group.”
“How these funds were spent is generally unclear,” it stated in 2020. “In Fairfax County—the source of Biden’s greatest vote haul and recipient of the largest yet identified CTCL grant ($1,431,950) in Virginia—elections officials used the funds to ‘support in-person early voting’ and ‘vote by mail’.”
The May 2021 update on how Fairfax County spent its funding is telling:
$967,294 for “temporary staffing support”
$59,850 for “vote-by-mail/absentee voting equipment or supplies”
$102,765 for “election administration equipment”
$54,802 for “voting materials in languages other than English”
$58,530 for “security for office and polling locations”
“Interestingly, categories included in the CTCL form (but which Fairfax didn’t apparently spend money on) include ‘ballot drop boxes,’ ‘drive-through voting,’ and ‘non-partisan voter education,’ as well as less alarming things such as ‘personal protective equipment’ for staff and cleaning expenses,” the CRC noted. “Fairfax County also applied for a 6-month extension for its grant (the report was filed in late January) to expend its remaining $187,709, which theoretically brings its CTCL funding through July 2021 and primary season for the state’s coming gubernatorial election in November.”
The effect of CTCL’s private funding of elections in Virginia appears to have had a significant effect. “The 14 CTCL-funded counties that Biden won received $3,563,610, or 89.8 percent of all the CTCL funds CRC has identified in Virginia,” the report pointed out.
“In July 2020, Virginia’s Democratic majority in the state legislature enacted statewide no-excuse absentee voting and early voting,” CRC added as background. “CTCL effectively bankrolled the Democrats’ biggest step toward replacing Election Day with ‘Election Month’ in the state’s largest county and a leftist stronghold.”
The Amistad Project of the Thomas More Society has been a frequent critic of ballot drop boxes and has filed lawsuits seeking greater accountability regarding their usage in elections, such as the 2020 election in Georgia. These election integrity lawsuits have tended to be dismissed by the courts.
In a statement to The Georgia Star News, national survey research and strategic services company McLaughlin & Associates CEO John McLaughlin explained why many Americans are alarmed by the use of “drop boxes.”
“The drop boxes which have been devised by President Obama’s former campaign manager David Plouffe and paid for by Mark Zuckerberg’s millions are a partisan tool for unconstitutional Democratic ballot harvesting and fraud,” stated McLaughlin. “They were never authorized by the state legislature. They are overwhelmingly located in Democratic areas, have no secure chain of custody by the Secretary of State who had no clue where they are coming from and according to our polls gave Joe Biden 273,000 net votes in a race that is separate by roughly 12,000 votes out of 5 million.”
“McLaughlin stated that the lack of clarity concerning these drop boxes is disconcerting. He pointed out the suspect nature of the relationship between Big Tech’s involvement in these election processes and their coordinated efforts through fact-checkers, warning labels, and other forms of censorship about the election,” The Georgia Star News noted.
“Who really knows how many fraudulent votes cited by the Amistad Project evidence hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes came via Zuckerberg drop boxes? No wonder Zuckerberg and other Big Tech oligarchs are censoring Americans on social media,” he said. “It’s a coverup. I’ll bet the midnight ballots on the infamous Fulton County videos that were counted on election night after they sent Republican monitors home came from these drop boxes. They stole Georgia from President Trump. Now they will steal the U.S. Senate from the American people.”
Now, the Virginia governor’s race may be next. It is a worse form of disenfranchisement to cancel a legitimate voter’s ballot with a fraudulent one than any issue stemming from the illegitimate belief that “convenience” is a voter’s right. Every single ballot in every single “drop box” and polling location should have a clear chain-of-custody. If that doesn’t take place on November 2nd, then the election is fraudulent.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_40371,"The eight previous Public Health England / UK Health Security Agency ‘Vaccine Surveillance’ reports on Covid-19 cases show that double vaccinated 40-79 year olds have now lost lost 50% of their immune system capability and are consistently losing a further 4-5% every week (between 3.7% and 7.9%).

Projections also now show that 30-49 year olds will have zero Covid / viral defence at best, or a form of vaccine mediated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome at worst, by the first week in January and all double vaccinated people over 30 will have completely lost that part of their immune system which deals with Covid-19 in the next 18 weeks.

By a concerned reader


The Vaccine Surveillance reports published by the UK Health Security Agency (previously Public Health England) of all fully genome sequenced UK Delta Covid-19 cases (mainly using a genome identifying PCR test), clearly show the progressive damage that the vaccines are doing to the immune response of the fully vaccinated.

Here is the weekly decline in double vaccinated immune system performance compared to unvaccinated people.

Vaccine efficacy is measured using Pfizer’s vaccine effectiveness formula… 

Unvaccinated case rate per 100k – Fully Vaccinated case rate per 100k / the Larger of Unvaccinated or Vaccinated case rate

We are using the normalised absolute ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated case numbers to determine vaccine effectiveness just as Pfizer itself does.


A vaccine effectivenessof +50% means that double vaccinated people are 50% more protected from Covid than unvaccinated people. It means that the Delta case rate in the vaccinated is half the delta case rate in the unvaccinated. 

A Vaccine efficacy of -50% means that unvaccinated people are 50% more protected from Covid than doubly vaccinated people. It means that the delta case rate in the vaccinated is double the Delta case rate in the unvaccinated. 

A Vaccine efficacy of 0% means that doubly vaccinated people are 0% more protected from Covid than unvaccinated people. It means that the delta case rate in the vaccinated equals the Delta case rate in the unvaccinated. It means the vaccines have lost all their effectiveness.



These new figures show a slowing down in degradation last week which is good news. But they also show children are beginning to suffer immune system degradation which is despicable news. Their figures went up due to more and more 12-15 year olds being included in the cohort since Chris Whitty overruled the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They have now just about finished being included. So the slow degradation can now begin to be seen.

At the other end of the age scale, the 80+ group saw a major improvement, due to the boosters which will buy them a couple of months of improved Covid immunity which will hide the continuing gradual immune system degradation. These boosters are the same as the original vaccinations (because no other shot has yet been approved).

So the worry is that whilst Covid-19 immunity may be improved for a couple of months, their general immunity will begin to degrade even faster than it would have done had the booster not been taken. We shall see if that turns out to be the case from future data.

The 70-79 year olds are also seeing a slow down in apparent degradation due to the boosters improving their Covid response. It may also be the case that other age group are already taking boosters. There is no shortage of places who will vaccinate people on demand without offering the necessary information for giving an informed consent. The latest clinical information from Dr Richard Fleming detailed below is terminal for vaccines and boosters.

The risk benefit analysis for these vaccines has now become a risk detriment analysis for everyone over 30.

Latest Projections
Everybody over 30 will have lost 100% of their entire immune capability (certainly for Covid and most likely for viruses and certain cancers – following the evidence from Cole Diagnostics in Idaho and Dr Nathan Thompson and Dr Ralph Baric) within 18 weeks. 

Fully vaccinated 30-49 year olds will have lost it by the 1st week in January. These people will then have no immune defence against Covid-19 at all. The question then becomes how much of the immune system is involved in defending against Covid-19? The worst case scenario is that they effectively develop full blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and destroy the NHS.

“In individuals aged greater than 30, the rate of positive COVID-19 test is higher in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated”. – PHE Vaccine Surveillance Report for week 41.

“There is the potential for ADE, but the bigger problem is probably Th2 immunopathology,” says Ralph Baric, an epidemiologist and expert in coronaviruses—named for the crown-shaped spike they use to enter human cells—at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

In previous studies of SARS, aged mice were found to have particularly high risks of life-threatening Th2 immunopathology in which a faulty T cell response triggers allergic inflammation, and poorly functional antibodies that form immune complexes, activating the complement system and potentially damaging the airways.

Baric expresses his concern about what that might mean for use of a COVID-19 vaccine in elderly people. “Of course, the elderly are our most vulnerable population,” he adds. – https://www.pnas.org/content/117/15/8218  (the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA)

The underlined passage (which has been redacted from the online PNAS report – but is in many other online copies – https://principia-scientific.com/study-covid-19-vaccine-can-destroy-your-immune-system/) is critical as it relates to an immune deficiency in killer T cells.

This was seen by Dr Ryan Cole who has done over 100,000 pathology lab examinations from Covid patients. He identified it as a form of AIDS (reverse HIV he called it – where you lose CD8 killer T cells rather than CD4 Helper T cells). Ralph Baric should know. In 2002 on April 19, the University of North Carolina filed US patent 7279327 for an infectious replication defective coronavirus (to be used as a virus vector for an HIV vaccine), claiming priority from US28531801P. Inventors were: Kristopher M. Curtis, Boyd Yount, Ralph S. Baric

These immune system degradations could be caused by ADE (Antibody Dependent Enhancement – where the vaccine induced antibodies start working in reverse) and be specific to Covid, or could be more general and result in a form of vaccine mediated AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). Baric suspects the latter above.

The fact that the 3rd Jabs worked in Israel (for a short period of time before the 4th jabs were proposed) means that vaccine antibodies do still have a protective effect immediately after vaccination. So that may rule out ADE. The latest figures suggest that boosters are working, in the short term for 70-79-year-olds and 8the 80+.

The falling efficacy of the vaccines does not asymptotically approach zero (which would mean that vaccines merely lose effectiveness over time). It goes straight through zero and then goes dangerously negative (which means the vaccines become toxic to the immune system). Then it goes more negative in a linear manner week on week. If this continues then the vaccines will completely destroy the part of your immune system which deals with Covid by the end of January. 

This may well result in more cases of Shingles, HPV, Herpes, Epstein Barr, Endometriosis and other viral infections – https://www.nbc12.com/2021/10/15/reports-shingles-outbreaks-not-directly-linked-covid-19-vaccine/ 

HARRISONBURG, Va. (WHSV) – There have been case studies showing people are experiencing recurrences or outbreaks of shingles after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Local doctors say that is rare and not necessarily caused by the vaccine.
“I’ve seen a lot of shingles recently, but I haven’t seen it associated with the vaccine personally. That’s my personal experience,” Dr. Jennifer Derby, a family physician with Sentara RMH, said. (2021October15)

Choosing your formula…

The Immune System boost/degradation column is a measure of the boost or damage to your immune system – see report
The Vaccine Effectiveness % for double vaccinated column shows how much more or less resistant to Covid the double vaccinated are than the unvaccinated – see report

So if you are 40 years old and double vaxxed then your immune response is now degraded by 56.9%.  This means that unvaccinated 40 year olds are 56.9% less likely to catch covid than the fully vaccinated, and the fully vaccinated 40 year olds are 131.9% more likely to catch covid than the unvaccinated.

You can look at it either way. It just depends whether your chosen parameter is the double vaccinated or the unvaccinated. But whichever one you choose, the outlook this winter for those who have been fully vaccinated with the experimental Covid-19 injections looks terrible.

PHE death rates verses ONS death rates
There is a massive immunological contradiction between the PHE case rates which crudely speaking now show that the vaccinated are twice as likely to be infected as unvaccinated whereas the PHE death rates show that the unvaccinated are 3 to 6 times more likely to die than the vaccinated.

The contradiction arises because the immunological functionality of the vaccines is merely to increase or decrease the viral load, but we now know that the viral loads are the same in the vaccinated as in the unvaccinated (see here).

This was also confirmed by Dr Fauci earlier this year –

“What we learned that’s new … is that when you look at the level of virus in the nasopharynx of people who are vaccinated who get breakthrough infections, it’s really quite high and equivalent to the level of virus in the nasopharynx of unvaccinated people who get infected,” Fauci said in an interview with CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. The nasopharynx is part of the nasal cavity near the back of the throat https://www.theepochtimes.com/fauci-amount-of-covid-19-in-breakthrough-delta-cases-almost-identical-to-unvaccinated_3929532.html

Furthermore it is known that the vaccines have been becoming progressively less effective/more damaging since then. So what is happening with case numbers should also be occurring with deaths unless the vaccines only kick in at near lethal viral loads. But that is nonsense because they merely train the immune system to recognise a new antigen. They should be altering the manner in which it responds upon recognition. Vaccines do not do that.

Although of course these gene therapies are a lot more than vaccines. So from Fauci’s own mouth the death should be following the case numbers not going in the other direction. Fortunately the ONS (Office of National Statistics) produce overall mortality figures and Profs Norman Fenton and Martin Neil of Queen Mary College University of London have analysed these as follows –


Week 26 was 2021 June 28th -July 4th. Below is the mortality rate for those who had received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine for the first half of 2021 –


Since 19th March the double dose vaccination mortality rate has increased week-on-week more or less consistently. – Prof Norman Fenton – https://www.normanfenton.com/post/comparing-age-adjusted-all-cause-mortality-rates-in-england-between-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated 

So the ONS death rates as analysed by Prof Fenton are consistent with the PHE case rates as analysed in the article. The PHE death rates are not credible. So the ONS death rates show the same linear increase as the PHE case numbers are showing. That makes a lot more sense immunologically.

The effect of the Pfizer Vaccine on the blood
Dr Richard Fleming teamed up with Prof Luc Montagnier, who won the Nobel prize for discovering HIV, and filed a case in the Hague along with Holocaust survivors on breaches of the Nuremberg Code by Government worldwide forcing vaccines on their citizens (see here).

Then he had the simple idea (which no one else appears to have thought of) to look at blood samples under the microscope and then add the Pfizer Vaccine.

The vaccine destroys all the Haemoglobin in the blood and makes the red cells stick together and form clots. It is amazing – the blood just stops being red. That is why people cannot breathe. Watch minute 9 to minute 20 of this video and you will see precisely what the vaccines do to human blood. 


When you are jabbed, the vaccine goes into your deltoid muscle hopefully (they are supposed to withdraw the plunger slightly to make sure they have not hit a blood vessel – but they are not generally doing that now). If it hits a blood vessel then what you see in the video happens immediately

If the jab does hit the muscle then the above happens more slowly.


The lighter areas on the left and right pictures are where a drop of the Pfizer vaccine has hit the blood on the 40x microscope slide. You can see that the red colour is missing from the red cells in the vaccine droplet areas. This is the destruction of your haemoglobin by the vaccine. It occurs within seconds according to the video.

If you have no haemoglobin, then your blood cannot carry any oxygen to your tissues and your breathing fails. The video also show that the haemoglobin depleted red blood cells start to stick together. They start to clot within minutes of the vaccine mixing with the blood, destroying the blood’s ability to carry oxygen."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_989904,"In a new peer-reviewed Rapid Communication published in Science, Public Health Policy & the Law, scientists affiliated with the University of Auckland Epidemiology and Biostatistics division in the School of Population Health report that the US CDC made a grave error in its own report on whether COVID-19 vaccination leads to spontaneous abortions when used during pregnancy.
Drs. Simon Thornley and Aleisha Brock report: 
“…the influential CDC-sponsored article by Shimabukuro et al. (2021) used to support this idea, on closer inspection, provides little assurance, particularly for those exposed in early pregnancy. The study presents falsely reassuring statistics related to the risk of spontaneous abortion in early pregnancy, since the majority of women in the calculation were exposed to the mRNA product after the outcome period was defined (20 weeks’ gestation).”
The authors then performed their own re-assessment and estimated that unexpected termination of pregnancies actually occurred at a rate 7-8 times higher in vaccinated pregnant women than the rate in the baseline over the same time period.
The report, which was peer-reviewed using a blinded review process in which the authors were unaware of the reviewers’ identities, is one of a growing number of reports and studies by academic researchers who find the studies and reports from official sources flawed, fraudulent, or rife with unacceptable errors.
The article includes a note from SciPub Editor-in-Chief Dr. James Lyons-Weiler which reminds the reader that Dr. Shimabukuro, who authors the flawed report, also failed to detect any signal of myocarditis in his analysis of data from another system (the Vaccine Safety Database) in a report to the HHS Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices as well as in his report to the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). Myocarditis is a medical condition that is now known by the FDA as a risk that must be communicated to people receiving COVID-19 vaccinations.
Science, Public Health Policy & the Law is an official publication of the The Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, Public Health Policy Initiative (IPAK PHPI) that publishes peer-reviewed studies, reports and analyses of the mismatch between science, public health, medical practice and the law.
The same journal published a review critical of CDC’s COVID-19 reporting practices, which are now known to be biased downward due to a number of important factors, including an unacceptably high false positive rate in the use of PCR tests to diagnose COVID-19 and to determine cause of death in persons who may or may not have a SARS-CoV-2 infection. It also recently published an analysis of the CDC’s vaccine adverse events reporting system (VAERS) which found that more deaths had been reported in the months following the start of the COVID-19 vaccination program than in all of the years that VAERS has been collecting data, for all vaccines combined.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_596390,"As most of my followers on social media and Substack must know by now, I have spent a considerable amount of time the last two years trying to discover the actual ingredients of the new COVID vaccines. The reason is simple: Big Pharma has gone to considerable trouble to hide them.

Do the Big Pharma companies want to submit the vaccines to independent analysis? They do not! Do the Big Pharma companies want to disclose all the ingredients? They do not! Do the Big Pharma companies have any liability for lying to the public about the proprietary ingredients in their vaccines? They do not.
We have a leaked copy of the legal agreement that Big Pharma companies (allegedly) have forced nation-states to sign in order to get the new COVID vaccines. These contracts include indemnification clauses that no sane human being would ever sign. This copy leaked from Albania:

One thing is certain: Big Pharma is not standing behind these products. They’re totally experimental and untested and so forth — so why are the world’s governments so hellbent on injecting their citizens with this stuff?
I received a tip regarding some of these ingredients, and so I did what nobody in American corporate journalism does anymore: I checked the primary sources.
Allow me to share my secret and very profound methodology:
1) I went to the MODERNA website.
2) I clicked to the PATENTS page.
3) I found PATENT US 10,703,789
4) I conducted a keyword search for something called: Luciferase.
Such are the complex technical skills which have been lost by corporate journalists. So what did I find there? Well, sitting on page 46 in table 4, you will see that I found something called Luciferase:

What’s Luciferase?
Luciferase is an enzyme that can produce bioluminescence. (It can make things glow, basically.) That’s why Luciferase is commonly used in the biomedical industry. It’s used to tag very tiny things like cells or proteins so that you can track them.
It tags things so you can track them.
Was Luciferase listed as an ingredient in the COVID vaccines by Big Pharma? No it was not. (You can check here at the CDC website.) So the next question becomes: why would Big Pharma not disclose that Luciferase is an ingredient in the vaccines - since it’s clearly listed (in at least one patent from one company) as being used?
The reason is rather ominous: Big Pharma has big plans for Luciferase and Big Government has big plans for it too. The U.S. military’s technology arm DARPA is currently fighting with Moderna over the ownership of the COVID vaccine because DARPA has “funded an implantable biochip” that could be used “to deploy” it:
Despite this, however, one obstacle to the deployment of Moderna’s vaccine is the method of delivery. While Moderna is developing its own system, it’s unlikely to get Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval any time soon. Enter Profusa, which is developing a nanoscale biochip that can detect symptoms of an infection.
Profusa’s biochip is made using a technology called “hydrogels” that were a product of the “In Vivo Nanoplatforms” (IVN) program that DARPA’s Biological Technologies Office (BTO) launched in 2014 to develop implantable nanotechnologies.
These hydrogels are soft, flexible nanomachines that are injected beneath the skin to perform monitoring. This hydrogel includes a specially engineered molecule that sends a fluorescent signal outside the body when it begins to fight infection. This signal can then be detected by a sensor attached to the skin that can then be sent to an app or even to a doctor’s website.
Why is the U.S. military working with vaccine companies to create micro-chips (that’s “hydrogels” or “nanotech”!) that will send a “fluorescent signal” (that’s Luciferase!) detectable by an app on your smartphone? When did DARPA get involved in public health policy exactly? That strange question leads to other strange questions like: why did the Pentagon fund the Wuhan Lab of Virology to “study” weaponizing bat coronaviruses? Neither DARPA nor the Pentagon are well known for being leaders in health care, to say the very least.
In fact, Big Pharma and Big Government have big plans for future vaccine shots that have “dissolvable needles” and quantum dot tattoos along with other amazing technology like embedding vaccine records beneath the skin of your children with invisible ink. According to one article: “Along with the vaccine, a child would be injected with a bit of dye that is invisible to the naked eye but easily seen with a special cell-phone filter, combined with an app that shines near-infrared light onto the skin.” That article was written in 2019: that’s just before the COVID crisis. That leads me to another thought: COVID-19 seems to be a very convenient “accidental lab leak” from China for introducing new technology.
Under the cover of vaccinating people, we are really preparing to tag and track people. The once free nations of the West are testing a new authoritarian system of total control under the guise of public health. Just look at Australia or New Zealand or Canada or Italy to see how basic civil rights have been suspended indefinitely and a pseudo-medical tyranny has been installed. The Great Reset is being implemented with the lie that it’s all about “protecting your health.” Our military and intelligence agencies are not confronting China — they're copying China. A totalitarian nightmare is being imported into free countries through surveillance technologies.
You don’t have to be a Christian to understand that such technology will be used to build a global surveillance state. The vaccine mandates have already led to vaccine passports. The vaccine passports are basically QR codes to track you by connecting to your smartphone. This will inevitably lead very soon to biometric ID embedded into your body. You won’t be able to enter restaurants or buy groceries or go to work without it. As the Bible says: no one will be able to buy or sell anything except those that have the mark. You will know the mark by its name, which is the name of the beast: the enemy of all mankind who, before he fell, was an angel of light named Lucifer. That’s why “Luciferase” should send a chill down your spine.
So I sent out the following tweet to my followers (with a video showing the Luciferase patent information) earlier this week:

This one tweet was sufficient, apparently, to get the word “Luciferase” trending on Twitter. (I didn’t notice at the time because I was busy covering the Glenn Youngkin victory on election night.) It was not until the next day that it became clear this one tweet had stirred up all the Big Pharma bots working remotely from Beijing.
The largest producer of misinformation in America, The Washington Post, ran a piece on my tweet where I was branded a “COVID conspiracy theorist.” The Daily Beast ran a piece and then ran a second piece. Something called The Hill ran a piece. The forgotten boomer finance magazine Forbes got involved. Vanity Fair, the perfume ad magazine, did a little column on it. Then it became an international thing with The Independent and The Daily Mail chiming in.

Now you have to ask yourself: are my tweets about vaccine ingredients really making headline news around the world? I checked with my husband first to see if I was indeed that famous. His response was disappointing. He told me: “At best, you’re semi-famous.” When corporate media outlets around the English-speaking world all start to scream in such coordinated fashion, you know you’ve hit a nerve. Why would they suddenly go crazy over the COVID vaccine ingredients?
It’s because Big Journalism is being paid by Big Pharma to not disclose the truth. In fact, Big Pharma is paying Big Journalism to actively hide the truth around the world. Why do you think the COVID journalist Alex Berenson got kicked off Twitter? Why did the corporate media unleash a hate campaign against feminist icon Naomi Wolf? Why isn’t ex-Pfizer chief scientist Dr. Michael Yeadon allowed to speak? How is it possible that the inventor of mRNA vaccines himself, Dr. Robert Malone, is not a household name around the world? You know the answer: they have all warned us about the dangers of the new COVID vaccines. They have been silenced by Big Tech and Big Pharma because they have all dared to tell the truth.
They are not alone. How many thousands have been banned or suspended already by Big Tech for questioning the COVID vaccines in our supposedly free nation? How many of your civil rights, your constitutional rights, can they trample before your very eyes? America is no longer a constitutional republic: it’s more like a corporate oligarchy where Big Pharma and Big Tech and Big Government tell you every day what you’re allowed to do on Zoom calls from the CDC with Dr. Fauci. They’re not even pretending anymore. This is something like Day 575 of “15 days to slow the spread.” Our so-called civil servants and elected officials are never going to give up their new “emergency powers” on their own. They mean to rule over us, and everybody knows it.
That’s why the COVID-19 pandemic is being used to force everyone to get the new vaccines. That’s why natural immunity doesn’t count to anyone in the medical community. That’s why religious exemptions have disappeared at your work, along with medical exemptions. That’s why Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (and every other therapeutic drug) were swiftly outlawed. That’s why your 5 year old child will be “encouraged” and then coerced and then forced to take the jab, just as you were “encouraged” and then coerced and then forced to take the jab. That’s why the global vaccination campaign never stops when the already vaccinated start to get sick with COVID, or young boys suddenly die from heart inflammation, or world famous soccer players collapse on TV in the middle of games. That’s why health data (whether from Israel or Sweden or Florida or your local hospital) is totally irrelevant. The vaccine is being forced on everyone because the vaccine and the vaccine passport are the essential tools of a global surveillance system that will end everyone’s basic human freedom.
You have been warned."

A source close to Gavin Newsom told The Defender the governor experienced an adverse reaction to the Moderna COVID vaccine he received Oct. 27.
This also explains why nobody has seen him in public since then; anyone who saw him would instantly know.
I checked into this and I’m over 90% sure that this is true (but I can’t tell you publicly about it without revealing my source) which prompted me to write this article.
Am I 100% certain? No. This is just my personal educated hypothesis piecing together the information (both from public and private sources) that I’ve gathered.
What’s your best guess?
The latest info I have is he is going livestream 11:45 am on November 9 at the California Economic Summit per this article.
This Fox News article says: “Newsom press secretary Daniel Lopez said the governor worked at the state Capitol last week and would begin making normal appearances again sometime this week, according to a statement provided to SFGATE.”
Really?!?! “Sometime this week???” And no explanation for why he’s dropped out of sight for 2 weeks and cancelled his appearance at the UN Climate Summit on Nov 1-3?
This seems really suspicious to me.
On the other hand, this article claims he’ll appear tomorrow (November 9). And another article doesn’t even speculate as to when he’ll be back.
Look, it can’t be a family emergency… Why not do a quick video on Twitter saying that he’s fine and dispel the rumors? He’s completely off the grid.
Alex Jones did some digging and found a story that is consistent with a vaccine injury: Newsom is isolated in his home with doctors going in and out.
So we’ll soon see who got it right.
How I arrived at my hypothesis
Here’s the background for my hypothesis:
Twitter reports of facial paralysis (my first thought was Bell’s Palsy).
Emails with my friends say it is GBS (either can cause facial paralysis).
I had a “soft” confirmation from a friend who absolutely knows him. The friend acted in a way consistent with the hypothesis that he has GBS or Bell’s Palsy.
I’ve heard from two lawyers, both of whom told me he has GBS. One lawyer talked to two different very close friends of Gavin and got the exact same story: GBS.
There is an article about it on the CHD website (archived here)
Confirmation in multiple checks done by Alex Jones.
Albert Benavides (aka WelcomeTheEagle88) recently did a VAERS analysis for me looking at symptoms which are elevated by the vaccine versus a 5-year baseline rate (VAERS reports from 2015-2019).
Look at what popped up on #11 (the 11th highest elevated adverse event). You are 1,533 times more likely to get Bell’s Palsy after the COVID vaccines than any other vaccine.

NOTE: This screen shot is the “tip of the iceberg” as far as serious adverse events caused by the COVID vaccines. The full list is over 5,000 elevated adverse events and I’ll be writing about this later today on substack (subscribe to be notified).

Guillain-Barre after these vaccines is less likely than Bell’s Palsy by a factor of 4.5, so I’m guessing it is more likely Bell’s Palsy (but it very well could be GBS).
Did the vaccine cause Bell’s Palsy (or GBS) for Newsom? He was perfectly fine before the shot and within hours after the shot he’s paralyzed. Could be bad luck. But come on.
Why doesn’t he just admit the truth, that he got Bell’s Palsy (or GBS) from the vaccine? Well truth telling is not how it is done in politics. The reason he won’t tell the truth it:
It would create vaccine hesitancy because it would be an admission that the vaccines aren’t safe like he claims
It would make him look silly for mandating very dangerous vaccines in California.
He doesn’t want to make the CDC look incompetent for never spotting the safety signal.
Newsom is still mandating that your kids get the vaccine. He’s even tweeting about it after being injured!
You can’t make this stuff up. Check out the tweet and the date. He’s acting like nothing happened to him:

Hundreds of previously healthy kids will suffer neurological damage just like he did as a result of his mandate. Hundreds of kids will die from the vaccine.
Bell’s and GBS are just two of over 5,000 adverse events that are elevated by these vaccine. More troubling is that the risk-benefit analysis for 5 to 11 I’ve seen shows we will kill 117 kids to maybe save 1 kid from COVID.
Governor Newsom and the CDC don’t seem to care about that; there’s not even a CDC category for vaccine deaths.
Over 120,000 Americans have suffered from Bell’s Palsy after vaccination (you take the incidence rate from the table and multiply by the minimum VAERS underreporting factor (URF) of 41 which is calculated here) and it could easily be over 250,000 cases.
A neurologist I know has over 2,000 clients with vaccine injuries (out of 20,000 client base). The neurologist never had any events before now in his/her practice caused by the vaccine. This shows you it is the vaccine causing the events, not “over reporting” as is claimed by the FDA.
When will it end?
I hope soon. But nobody in America likes to admit they were wrong. Even after they’ve been injured.
Joel Kallman, the creator of the V-safe application, died shortly after he was vaccinated. He never got a chance to tell people what he thought of the safety of the vaccine.

Let’s hope that Newsom gets the chance to learn from this and change his thinking.
P.S. If you think you know whether it is GBS or Bell’s Palsy, please comment below."

This should all sound familiar because it’s how we got into this mess to begin with….
In 2020, during the Kenosha riots when Kyle Rittenhouse was arrested, mysterious bricks were delivered. In fact, every single city where a riot broke out had stacks and stacks of bricks delivered, seemingly out of nowhere. In most places, security had been disabled so that no one could access security camera videos and see who delivered the bricks in stacks off of trucks on huge pallets.
Naturally, if you happen to put this question in front of thousands of curious researchers who have fun working together and you ask, “Who is the Brick Wizard?” it’s basically like firing off a shot at the beginning of a race.
Urged to “follow the bricks,” we dove right in….

Pro tip: Many of the tweets from the corresponding dates in late May through early June 2020 regarding the bricks and their timeline have mysteriously since disappeared from Twitter. (Really. I’m shocked.)
It’s a good thing Telegram creates a hard backup of the media when you post so you never have to lose anything that Twitter decides to censor.
Note: these tweets I’m posting - these are ALL GONE.
ALL OF THEM.

Aww. “Acme Brick.” That’s real cute….

And… it’s go time.
From here, it takes us all of ten seconds to figure it out after grabbing the photos down off of Twitter.
We’re a smidge kind of good at what we do….
And, you know, humble.
Acme Brick is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway.
And that would be Warren Buffett.
And that's Bill Gates's mentor.
Behold the Brick Wizard.
List of assets owned by Berkshire Hathaway. First on the list is Acme Brick Company.
So we wonder, “Do the rest of these links from the budget disclosure track back to BH? Huge stakes in Amazon (made billions off the lockdowns) and Apple (contact tracing). Also Costco.”
And I’ll be honest - I wasn’t thinking this through entirely yet. Later, it dawned on me that the purpose for holding that much Apple clearly would be to short it when the Three Gorges dam finally collapses and all of Apple’s production facilities are downstream of the water flow in a place with zero drainage infrastructure… like, say… nowish?
So… we wanted to know what else he owns. And the pieces started to fit together. Kinda like interlocking bricks….

Buffett's stocks have made a killing off of covid lockdowns. (Also, he shorted the airlines and made a killing on that too.)
The Trump administration was bringing antitrust/conspiracy charges against Teva (in Buffett’s portfolio) which Teva tried to simply walk away from, thinking there was no way the admin would pursue this during a “pandemic,” and even published a ballsy press release to that effect when the US did bring charges. Teva is in generics. They ended up donating an obscene amount of hydroxychloroquine. And they make azithromyacin. Both are, of course, used as treatments for covid.

At this point, coverage from Zero Hedge drops:

Baltimore, huh? You'd think with all that Baltimore aerial surveillance we'd have an ID on who's dropping bricks by now....
At that time, Arnold Ventures had funded an entire Baltimore aerial surveillance program. The same pallets have surfaced in multiple cities, including Baltimore, which has crazy aerial surveillance in place. So Baltimore should have been able to pull footage on the brick drop in their city.
Except that the Arnolds who funded the aerial surveillance in Baltimore - their firm's director used to work for the Gates Foundation. Part of the press puff piece was how they started AV as an answer to Gates's call for all billionaires to step into “philanthropy.” Apparently, surveilling all of Baltimore from the sky without the citizens’ consent is somehow philanthropic.
Wake me up when the doublespeak is over….
With this group, damn near everything means the opposite of what it says. For instance, ""child trafficking charities"" are ways to hide trafficking children. Notice they’re not called “anti-trafficking” charities. “Covid treatment” is not called “anti-covid treatment.” “Cancer treatment” is not called “anti-cancer treatment.”
This is like living in a Chuck Palahniuk novel.
This dropped from Timcast:

Then we started to notice something really weird.
We started to see all of this divide and conquer interplay with oligarchs, politicians, business people, and corporate entities paying off criminals via an elaborate bail money laundering scheme that funneled money from non-profit organizations to the courts to be returned to the criminals through the bail system, not back to the non-profits.
And, no matter which trail we followed… bricks, drugs, stocks, banks, non-profits, corporations… it didn’t matter… every single money trail led us back to the same groups: Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, and Berkshire Hathaway.
Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, and Berkshire Hathaway are the four largest investment firms on the planet.
They own literally everything. There is no competition. There is only the illusion of competition.
So, ultimately, if you want to know where the bricks are coming from, we're really looking at asymmetric warfare funded by many billionaires on behalf of the entire cabal to destabilize America.
And the only things they fear are unity and people like Kyle Rittenhouse.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_441509,"The vaccine is deadlier than the virus.
The Daily Expose reported:
What the BBC is not telling you is that for every “unvaccinated” Covid death there are four “vaccinated” Covid deaths. For months we have been reporting on the higher proportion of people who sadly succumb and die with Covid after being injected with the so-called “vaccines.” Additionally, as we have frequently written, there are the vaccine-induced injuries, illnesses and deaths.  Contrary to what corporate media would have you believe, the Covid injections are neither safe nor effective. 
UK Health Security Agency (“UKHSA”) statistics are clear and so is the text which accompanies them. For people who feel overwhelmed by statistics and numbers there is sufficient information if we read the words contained in the UKHSA’s ‘Vaccine Surveillance Report’ (“VSR”). It is all hidden in plain sight and the BBC, and much of corporate media, should be, at the very least, labelled “co-conspirators” and censored for spreading misinformation and disinformation.
Prior to the launch of the Covid injection campaign there were three statistics corporate media reminded us of daily, and repeatedly: cases, hospitalisations and deaths.  Since the Covid injection campaign began reporting these statistics must have become a mine field for them.
Summary:
UKHSA admits “asymptomatic cases” are not a concern for spreading Covid
UKHSA does not use cases, positive PCR tests, to determine disease.
UKHSA uses non-peer reviewed studies and a study prepared by their own public health officials to estimate a “vaccine effectiveness” of 90% protection against mortality.
Real-world data shows a waning of protection until it flips and the opposite occurs – “vaccinated” people are at higher risk of hospitalisation and death.  “Vaccinated” people appear to be developing a vaccine-induced immunodeficiency disorder, a condition similar to AIDS.
Vaccine effectiveness
The VSR for week 45 (11 Oct- 7 Nov), page 5, states: “Large clinical trials have been undertaken for each of the Covid-19 vaccines approved in the UK which found that they are highly efficacious at preventing symptomatic disease in the populations that were studied … Vaccine effectiveness is estimated by comparing rates of disease in vaccinated individuals to rates in unvaccinated individuals.”
On pages 5 to 8 of the VSR then describes “vaccine effectiveness” as measured using symptomatic disease, hospitalisations, mortality and transmission.
UKHSA is admitting “asymptomatic cases” – healthy people – are no longer a cause for concern in controlling the spread of an infectious respiratory disease.  Doctors, scientists and many others have been highlighting this obvious fact from early on.  The BBC calls such people “conspiracy theorists.”  We expect the Trusted News Initiative will hunt UKHSA down, and Facebook (Meta), Twitter, Google, LinkedIn et al. will “fact check,” shadow ban and censor UKHSA as they have joined the “conspiracy theorists.”
Vaccine effectiveness and cases
We choose to ignore case numbers and case rates as we know the use of the PCR test to detect infection is fraudulent.  The BBC may think number of cases is important however UKHSA agrees, at least in part, with the “conspiracy theorists” and also chooses to ignore them.
On page 23 the UKHSA states: “Comparing case rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations should not be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 infection. Vaccine effectiveness has been formally estimated from a number of different sources and is summarised on pages 5 to 8 in this report.”   And on page 8 UKHSA states: “uninfected individuals cannot transmit” the virus.
In other words, “vaccine effectiveness” is based on symptomatic disease, hospitalisations and death.  It follows that the UKHSA recommends ignoring case rates as presumably cases, positive PCR tests, are not a reliable indicator to establish infection or disease.
Since March 2020, corporate media has groomed the public into believing cases, including asymptomatic, are key to controlling the “pandemic,” protecting the NHS and saving lives.  For well over a year cases and case rates, with the threat of imminent death, were used as a key measure to justify ruining lives and livelihoods by way of business shut-downs; bringing society to a standstill; and, imposing restrictions on our rights and freedoms.  From very early on corporate media referred to this as, and so instilled in the public’s psyche the idea of, “lockdown” – a term previously only used within prison environments.
Let’s put the uncomfortable truth regarding “cases” another way. The number of Covid cases or projected number of cases has determined whether: our livelihoods were ruined; children missed vital education; hospital and medical appointments for all other illnesses and conditions were virtually stopped or at best downgraded to little more than a telephone call; surgical procedures were cancelled; and, whether people were able to get married, attend a funeral, celebrate religious holidays, visit the elderly, or visit dying relatives in hospital.  The falling or rising number of cases determined how “hard” the proposed “lockdown” would be.
Now, when it comes to the number of rising cases post-Covid injection roll-out and how effective a so-called “vaccine” is in protecting the population from a “dangerous virus” – cases are, not only not key but, not a good measure of disease.
If this obvious contradiction of how “cases” are being used to manipulate your behaviour does not anger you then you have either lost the ability to think for yourself or you have lost your humanity.
Vaccine effectiveness, hospitalisation and deaths
The evidence UKHSA uses to prove “vaccine effectiveness” against hospitalisation are “several studies.”  They reference four studies.  One study is regarding a single dose of Covid injection, one is to estimate real world effectiveness and two are preprints, not yet peer reviewed.
The hospitalisations do not seem to be fitting their evidence.  In Table 4, page 19, of the 10,179 Covid patients hospitalised, almost two thirds had been “effectively vaccinated,” according to them, against hospitalisation.
On page 7, UKHSA states “high levels of protection (over 90%) are also seen against mortality” and references three studies. Two are preprints, yet to be peer reviewed, and the third – a study to estimate real world effectiveness – is the same study as cited for “effectiveness against hospitalisation.”  It was published on 13 May 2021 by authors with affiliations as shown in the image below.
Does real world data support the effectiveness estimated by public health officials? On page 20 and 21 of the VSR are tables of Covid deaths which show a “vaccinated” to “unvaccinated” ratio of 4,8:1.
For every one “unvaccinated” person, there are at least four “vaccinated” people who die with Covid.  Alternatively, 82% of Covid deaths are post-Covid injection – far from 90% protection against mortality, rather it is almost as if the opposite is true.
Below the table, on page 21, there is a footnote which attempts to make an excuse for the high mortality of the “vaccinated”: “even with a highly effective vaccine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases, hospitalisations and deaths would occur in vaccinated individuals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated and no vaccine is 100% effective.”
Does the real-world data support UKHSA’s assumption that it is reasonable for more “vaccinated” people to be dying with Covid than “unvaccinated”?  Not according to ONS data. Deaths dramatically increased, above the five year average, two months after the Covid injection campaign was launched.
The UK launched its Covid injection campaign on 8 December 2020.  According to the UK government’s ‘Deaths within 28 days of positive test by date of death’ there were 63,830 Covid deaths before the launch of the Covid injection roll-out.  Since then, up to 10 November 2021, there has been 78,922 Covid deaths.  There have been more Covid deaths post-Covid injection roll-out than before it began.
If the Covid injection was 90% effective in preventing death, why are “vaccinated” people currently dying at a ratio of 4,8:1 to “unvaccinated” people?
In a previous article we wrote extensively about the real-world effectiveness of the Covid injections using VSR data over a three month period and the waning of effectiveness until it reverses and has the opposite effect.   For week 45, everyone over the age of 30 shows a negative vaccine effectiveness – the “unvaccinated” are better protected against Covid than the “fully vaccinated.”  The “vaccines” are destroying people’s immune systems – causing an immunodeficiency disorder, similar to AIDS, but vaccine-induced.  The correlation is unequivocally clear but corporate media is not reporting it.
Anyone who propagates the mantra “the vaccine is safe and effective” is not being truthful.  Anyone who encourages, coerces or forces an experimental medical procedure onto another is committing or aiding and abetting “wounding with intent.”  Corporate media is spreading misinformation and disinformation – turn off the TV, neuro-linguistic programming is being used against you."

Fauci Wants Americans to Get 4 Shots Per Year
By Michael Baxter -November 26, 2021022
Deep State Dr. Anthony Fauci, the illegitimate administration’s chief vaccine pusher, is advocating for quarterly booster shots to combat a growing number of Covid-19 mutations that are resistant to single and double doses of the currently available Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson clot shots, an NIH whistleblower told Real Raw News.
The source, whose credentials RRN has verified and considers unassailable, said Fauci, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, and seven members of the Biden-Harris Health Equity Covid-19 task force met clandestinely at a D.C. hotel wednesday morning to discuss ways of perniciously convincing Americans to willingly accept frequent booster vaccinations.
The diabolical Deep Staters discussed specifically what the MSM is calling the South African B.1.1.529 super-strain, which materialized as if by magic over the Thanksgiving holiday. Fauci, our source said, told his accomplices that the new strain would soon reach American shores and wreak havoc on vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, sickening and killing hundreds of thousands.
But, according to our source, this mythical strain was fabricated of whole cloth; a fictious creation designed to frighten already paranoid people into believing that more shots are needed to prevent exposure to the virus.
“This was the plan all along, to make up new strains every 3-6 months. I’m not saying Covid-19 is fake. It’s real, it was a lab leak from Wuhan, but it was never more dangerous than seasonal influenza. The strains, however, were imagined to keep people in fear and locked down, and to generate massive profits for Big Pharma. Fauci figured early on that the public would only buy into a specific variant for so long before becoming suspicious. He told us, point blank, a new strain had to arise every so often so people would keep getting shots. It was the same for the Delta variant; it never existed. And now that people have gotten tired of hearing about it, and don’t care about it, they’ve manifested a new enemy, the South African strain,” our source said.
The proof, he added, is in the pudding: No vaccine manufacturer has altered or amended the chemical ingredients of the original vaccinations. They have stayed static.
“If this virus were truly becoming more transmissible and virulent, the vaccine manufacturers would be pouring tons of money into fighting the virus’ evolution. But this isn’t happening. And there’s not a shred of evidence of recombination among the population. It’s all about fear and money,” our source said.
Dr. Fauci, he claims, has been whimsically and arbitrarily deciding how many shots per year a person needs for protection against the virus, and that figure has, by no mere coincidence, increased proportionally to the increased salaries of Dr. Fauci and Big Pharma CEOs.
“Their personal incomes skyrocketed after the vaccines went public,” our source said. “That’s why Fauci now wants four shots a year. Four times as much cash in his pocket.”"
Politifact_FALSE_Social media_703074,🛑🛑🛑 Breaking NEWS --- None of your previous vaccines will protect you now from the emerging variant OMICRON
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_212205,"With the emergence of an alleged new variant that the UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said “may evade the current vaccines”, despite also saying “that is why you should get your boosters” in the same sentence, we felt it was best to take you on a journey through three months worth of UKHSA Covid-19 data to show you why, if the rumours are true, the unvaccinated population have absolutely nothing to worry about, but the vaccinated population have everything to fear.
You’ve most likely been seeing headlines like ‘Worst Ever Covid Variant’ in the mainstream media, such as this one from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded newspaper ‘The Guardian’.

But we doubt the same mainstream media, trying to once again frighten the nation into compliance with inevitable Draconian restrictions, has informed you that this alleged new variant was first discovered among four individuals, each of them fully vaccinated.

Current trends suggest that the unvaccinated will no doubt be blamed for the emergence of this new variant, and the onslaught of propaganda designed to sway the nation into supporting a lockdown of the unvaccinated will probably now pick up pace.
But is this justified?
The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) publish a weekly ‘Vaccine Surveillance’ report containing statistics on Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status across England over the past four weeks.
Their latest report, published Thursday November 25th covers data on infections, hospitalisations and deaths from Week 43 to Week 46 of 2021 (October 25th – November 21st).
The report reveals that there were 833,332 recorded Covid-19 cases, 9,094 Covid-19 hospitalisations and 3,700 Covid-19 deaths from October 25th to November 21st. Of these the unvaccinated accounted for 39% of all cases, 34% of all hospitalisations, and 19% of all deaths. Whilst the vaccinated accounted for 61% of all cases, 66% of all hospitalisations, and 81% of all deaths.

But a more detailed look at three months worth of Covid-19 data published by the agency reveals that projections show the fully vaccinated were already in for a very rough winter prior to the alleged emergence of the “worst ever” Covid-19 variant. Infections rates are already much higher among the fully vaccinated, and the case-fatality rate is frighteningly worse than what is being seen among the unvaccinated population.
We used the following reports for our analysis –
COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report – Week 39 (Covers Week 35-38)
COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report – Week 43 (Covers Week 39-42)
COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report – Week 47 (Covers Week 43-46)
Covid-19 Cases
The following chart shows the total number of cases over four week periods from August 30th to November 21st 2021 as per table 8 of the Vaccine Surveillance reports.

The chart reveals that things are improving for the unvaccinated population in terms of cases whilst they are getting worse for the fully vaccinated population.
The unvaccinated accounted for the majority of Covid-19 cases between both week 35-38 and week 39-42. But the most recent four weeks have seen a significant switch with the unvaccinated cases declining by nearly 100,000 cases from week 39-42, whilst the fully vaccinated cases increased by around 53,000.
It’s also worth noting that a steady increase has been recorded amongst the partly vaccinated population over the past three months, and the reason for this is that children, who are currently only eligible for a single dose, are still catching Covid-19.
This is despite Professor Chris Whitty the Chief Medical Officer for England claiming he was overruling the JCVI because the jab would help in preventing further disruption to the education of children.
We knew this was a lie at the time because the jabs cannot and do not prevent infection or transmission of the virus, but now we have the evidence to confirm it.

The above chart shows the cumulative number of cases over the past three months by vaccination status as well as the projected number of cases per week up to the 2nd week of January 2022 based on the current trend.
As things stand there were 1,067,859 Covid-19 cases among the unvaccinated population between Oct 25th and November 21st, with projections showing cases could increase to a cumulative total of approximately 2.5 million by the second week of January 2022 among the unvaccinated.
But there are far more cases among the fully vaccinated population, with 1,108,306 cases being recorded between Oct 25th and Nov 21st, and projections show cases could rise to a cumulative total of approximately 4.8 million by the second week of January.
This chart proves that even without the alleged new variant we were already going to see a ‘Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated’ this winter.
Covid-19 Hospitalisations
The following chart shows the total number of hospitalisations over four week periods from August 30th to November 21st 2021 as per table 9 of the Vaccine Surveillance reports.

The chart shows that hospitalisations among the unvaccinated have floated around the 3,000 mark over four week periods throughout the past three months.
But unfortunately for the fully vaccinated population, hospitalisations among this group have been getting progressively worse by the month.
The number of hospitalisations among the fully vaccinated between week 43 and 46 is 30% higher than the number of hospitalisations among the fully vaccinated between week 35 and 38. Whereas the number of hospitalisations among the unvaccinated between week 43 and 46 is just 5% higher than the number recorded between week 35 and 38.
This shows that the fully vaccinated are currently the biggest burden on the NHS, not the unvaccinated, and it also shows us something peculiar in terms of the overall picture considering the vaccines are supposed to reduce the risk of hospitalisation.
In all there were 1,067,859 cases among the unvaccinated between August 30th and November 21st. Therefore, with a total of 8,825 hospitalisations, the case-hospitalisation rate among the unvaccinated is 0.82%.
However, with 1,108,306 cases among the vaccination population during the same time frame, and 15,191 hospitalisations, the case-hospitalisation rate among the fully vaccinated is 1.37%.
Therefore, the case-hospitalisation rate among the fully vaccinated is 67% higher than the case-hospitalisation rate among the unvaccinated. Should this be the case when the Covid-19 injections are alleged to reduce the risk of hospitalisation by up to 95%?

The above chart shows the cumulative number of hospitalisations over the past three months by vaccination status as well as the projected number of hospitalisations up to the second week of 2022, and yet again things aren’t looking promising for the fully vaccinated.
Hospitalisations are projected to rapidly rise to an accumulative total of approximately 67,500 among the fully vaccinated, an increase of 52,309. Whilst the projected number of hospitalisations among the unvaccinated is expected to rise to approximately 17,500 , an increase of 8,675.
The vaccinated have currently accounted for 64% of hospitalisations since August 30th, but from November 21st to the second week of 2022 they are projected to account for 86% of hospitalisations, meaning they may have accounted for 80% of hospitalisations since August 30th by the time new year resolutions have gone out the window.
Covid-19 Deaths
The following chart shows the total number of deaths over four week periods from August 30th to November 21st 2021 as per table 10 of the Vaccine Surveillance reports.

From August 30th to November 21st, England recorded a total of 9,592 deaths. Of these just 1,882 were among the unvaccinated population, whilst a shocking 7,710 were among the vaccinated population, with nearly 3,000 of these deaths occurring in just the last four weeks.
Does this make sense to you when the fully vaccinated account for only 47% of cases and the vaccines are alleged to reduce the risk of death by 95%?

The above chart shows the cumulative number of deaths over the past three months by vaccination status as well as the projected number of deaths up to the second week of 2022, and things are looking disastrous for the fully vaccinated population.
Deaths are projected to rapidly rise to an accumulative total of approximately 34,000 among the fully vaccinated, an increase of 26,574. Whilst the projected number of deaths among the unvaccinated is expected to rise to just 4,500, an increase of 2,618.
Covid-19 Case / Hospitalisation / Fatality Rates

The above chart shows the total number of Covid-19 hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status and allows us to compare the numbers side by side. What this clearly demonstrates is that there is a much higher hospitalisation-fatality rate among the fully vaccinated and partly vaccinated populations than the rate among the unvaccinated population.
In all there were 8,825 hospitalisations and 1,882 deaths among the unvaccinated between August 30th and November 21st. Therefore, the hospitalisation-fatality rate is 21.3%.
But with 15.191 hospitalisations and 7,426 deaths among the fully vaccinated population population the hospitalisation-fatality rate is 48.88%.
This means the hospitalisation-fatality rate among the fully vaccinated population over the past three months has been 130% higher than the hospitalisation-fatality rate among the unvaccinated population.

The above chart shows the case-hospitalisation rate (No. Cases / No. Hosp.), case-fatality rate (No. Cases / No. Deaths), and hospitalisation fatality rate (No. Hosp / No. Deaths) by vaccination status.
It’s quite concerning to find that all three rates are much higher among the vaccinated population, we should surely be seeing the opposite if the Covid-19 vaccines reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death?
But unfortunately the above figures do not just suggest that the vaccines are ineffective, they actually suggest that they make the recipient worse.
A vaccine effectiveness of +95% against death from Covid-19 would mean that the unvaccinated population have a 95% higher chance of dying if infected with Covid-19 than the vaccinated.
A vaccine effectiveness of 0% would mean that the vaccines are ineffective and the vaccinated and unvaccinated have the same chance of dying if infected with Covid-19.
But a vaccine effectiveness of -95% would mean that the vaccines actually make the recipient worse, by for example decimating the recipients immune system, or invoking a response such as antibody-dependent-enhancement. Which makes the following figures extremely concerning.

The above chart shows the current increased risk of hospitalisation if infected with Covid-19, the current increased risk of death if infected with Covid-19, and the current increased risk of death if hospitalised with Covid-19, among the fully vaccinated population. The percentages have been calculated based on the ‘Rates by Vaccination Status’ calculated in the previous chart.
The chart shows that the fully vaccinated are 67% more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19 if infected, therefore this shows that the Covid-19 vaccines have an average vaccine effectiveness of -67% against hospitalisation.
But the most concerning figure demonstrated on the above chart shows that the fully vaccinated are 294% more likely to die with Covid-19 if infected. This shows that the Covid-19 vaccines have an average vaccine effectiveness of -294% against death.
Why?
The reason the fully vaccinated are actually suffering far worse than the unvaccinated, and are projected to suffer worse still, could have something to do with the fact that the data suggests the Covid-19 injections are decimating the immune systems of the vaccinated, as we demonstrated in a previous article published Tuesday November 16th which can be viewed here.

The case rates per 100,000 population contained in the UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance reports show that the fully vaccinated 30 to 79 year-olds have a much higher case rate than the unvaccinated population, and things are getting progressively worse by the month.
This means the Covid-19 injections are proving to have a negative effectiveness, and this unfortunately suggests that they are decimating the fully vaccinated populations immune systems, and we are seeing further evidence of this hidden in official government reports.
For instance, the Week 42 Vaccine Surveillance report published by the UKHSA states the following –
“Recent observations from UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) surveillance data that N antibody levels appear to be lower in individuals who acquire infection following 2 doses of vaccination.”

What this means is that the Covid-19 vaccines interfere with the immune systems ability to produce antibodies against other pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus following infection, in the case of the N antibody this is against the nucleocapsid protein which is the shell of the virus, and a crucial part of the immune system response in the unvaccinated population.
Therefore, if any mutations to the spike protein of the alleged SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in the future, the vaccinated will be far more vulnerable and possibly unprotected due to their inability to produce the N antibody, even if they have already been infected and recovered from Covid-19.
Whereas the unvaccinated would have much better immunity to any mutations due to their ability to produce both S and N antibodies after infection.
What do we know?
The new “worst ever” variant is called B.1.1.529 and is allegedly incredibly, heavily mutated.
Professor Tulio de Oliveira, the director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation in South Africa, said there was an “unusual constellation of mutations” and that it was “very different” to other variants that have circulated.
“This variant did surprise us, it has a big jump on evolution [and] many more mutations than we expected,” he said.
In a media briefing Professor de Oliveira said there were 50 mutations overall and more than 30 on the spike protein, which is the target of the Covid-19 vaccines and now the only part of the Covid-19 virus that the fully vaccinated are able to produce antibodies against, as confirmed in the UKHSA report.
Therefore, –  with 80% of deaths, 65% of hospitalisations, and 54% of cases being among the partly and fully vaccinated population since at least August 30th, proving England is experiencing a ‘Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated’, and the vaccinated populations inability to produce the N antibody because of the vaccines only targeting the spike protein – the unvaccinated population have absolutely nothing to worry about, but the vaccinated population have everything to fear in regard to the new “worst ever” Covid-19 variant."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_440652,"November 11, 2021, a rally formed outside of Lions Gate Hospital in North Vancouver, British Columbia (BC). The group was there to call attention to an unthinkable tragedy: 13 babies were reportedly stillborn at the hospital in a period of 24 hours. All of their mothers had received a COVID-19 injection.1
In a typical month, there may be one stillborn baby at the hospital, one of the protestors said, making the 13 stillbirths highly unusual. The only reason the deaths came to light was because several doulas came forward, detailing the events.
Vancouver Coastal Health has disputed the reports of stillbirths at Lions Gate Hospital, stating, “There is no truth to this claim … There has been no notable change to the incidence of stillbirths in the VCH region throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.”2
However, after speaking with police outside of the hospital, Dr. Daniel Nagase and Dr. Mel Bruchet started an official investigation, and Nagase launched an official complaint with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police against executives at the College of Physicians & Surgeons of BC, alleging conflicts of interest influencing their policies, decisions and statements made to the people of British Columbia.3
If any of the executives hold stocks, bonds or mutual funds, for instance, that gain value with increased sales of pharmaceuticals, Nagase said, then that’s a conflict of interest that should have been declared. The implication is that it can also influence their likelihood of further investigating the unusual number of stillbirths that occurred at the hospital, particularly in relation to the COVID-19 jab that their mothers received.
Spike in Newborn Baby Deaths in Scotland
Scotland has also experienced an unusual rise in infant death rates. During September 2021, at least 21 babies under 4 weeks old died — a rate of 4.9 per 1,000 births. The average death rate among newborns in Scotland is about 2 per 1,000 births.4
Public Health Scotland (PHS), which is investigating the deaths, stated, “Exceeding the upper control limit indicates there is a higher likelihood that there are factors beyond random variation that may have contributed to the number of deaths,” adding that there was “currently no indication of links between these deaths and Covid-19 infection.”5
It’s unclear whether the COVID-19 injection in pregnant women will be evaluated as a contributing or causative factor, though it absolutely should be.
PHS only said it was collaborating with the Scottish National Neonatal Network, the Maternity and Children Quality Improvement Collaborative and the Scottish Government “to understand any possible contributing factors to the most recent infant mortality patterns, and to incorporate findings into existing prevention and improvement work.”6
Fetal Deaths, Stillbirths Skyrocket in Injected Women
As of November 12, 2021, there were 2,620 cases of fetal death or stillbirth among women who received a COVID-19 injection reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).7 Health Impact News ran the same VAERS search, but this time excluded COVID-19 injections — to look for fetal deaths in women who had been vaccinated with any vaccine other than a COVID-19 jab over the last 30+ years. They found:8

“We are currently on pace to see a yearly total of 2,838 recorded fetal deaths following COVID-19 shots, while the yearly average of recorded fetal deaths following the vaccination of pregnant women for the past 30 years has been an average of 74 fetal deaths per year.”
Health officials are adamant that pregnant women get a COVID-19 injection, but the data don’t support its safety. The CDC-sponsored study9 published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) that was widely used to support the U.S. recommendation for pregnant women to get injected was corrected in October 2021, with the correction stating:10

“In the table footnotes, the following content should have been appended to the double dagger footnote:

“No denominator was available to calculate a risk estimate for spontaneous abortions, because at the time of this report, follow-up through 20 weeks was not yet available for 905 of the 1224 participants vaccinated within 30 days before the first day of the last menstrual period or in the first trimester. Furthermore, any risk estimate would need to account for gestational week–specific risk of spontaneous abortion.”

Data Used to Support COVID-19 Shot in Pregnant Women Flawed
In a rapid communication from the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge (IPAK), Aleisha Brock, Ph.D. of New Zealand, and Simon Thornley, Ph.D., a senior lecturer in the section of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Auckland, explained that the NEJM study “presents falsely reassuring statistics related to the risk of spontaneous abortion in early pregnancy, since the majority of women in the calculation were exposed to the mRNA product after the outcome period was defined (20 weeks’ gestation).”11
When the risk of spontaneous abortion, or miscarriage, was recalculated based on the cohort that was injected prior to 20 weeks’ gestation, the incidence of miscarriage was seven to eight times higher than the original study indicated, with a cumulative incidence of miscarriage ranging from 82% to 91%. According to the IPAK report:12

“The study indicates that at least 81.9% (≥ 104/127) experienced spontaneous abortion following mRNA exposure before 20 weeks, and 92.3% (96/104) of spontaneous abortions occurred before 13 weeks’ gestation. This is a very high proportion of pregnancy loss observed in those exposed to the mRNA vaccination before 20 weeks’ gestation, ranging from 81.9–91.2% …

The authors’ interpretation of no difference in the observed incidence of pregnancy loss in those who received their first mRNA vaccine before 20 weeks’ gestation compared to baseline must be questioned.

In light of these findings, key policy decisions have been made using unreliable and questionable data. We conclude that the claims made using these data on the safety of exposure of women in early pregnancy to mRNA-based vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are unwarranted and recommend that those policy decisions be revisited.”

Calls for Immediate Withdrawal of mRNA Shots
Not only does the IPAK data show COVID-19 injections prior to 20 weeks are unsafe for pregnant women, but 12.6% women who received it in the 3rd trimester reported Grade 3 adverse events, which are severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening. Another 8% also reported a fever of 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F), which can lead to miscarriage or premature labor.13
Further, the study follow-up only continued for 28 days after birth, meaning the long-term effects of prenatal exposure to babies is unknown. The many concerns of mRNA COVID-19 injections during pregnancy and breastfeeding include transmission of mRNA and spike protein across the placenta and through breast milk, as well as the inhibition of synctyin-1, a protein essential for cell fusion and placental development.
Pregnant women were excluded from the mRNA injection clinical trials, but a Pfizer-BioNTech rat study revealed the injection more than doubled the incidence of preimplantation loss and also led to a low incidence of mouth/jaw malformations, gastroschisis (a birth defect of the abdominal wall) and abnormalities in the right-sided aortic arch and cervical vertebrae in the fetuses.14
Together, IPAK believes the data are compelling enough to withdraw the shots for vulnerable populations. Noting their advice in boldface, they say:15

“Considering the evidence presented here, we suggest the immediate withdrawal of mRNA vaccine use in pregnancy (Category X) and those breastfeeding, alongside the withdrawal of mRNA vaccines to children or those of child-bearing age in the general population, until more convincing data relating to the safety and long-term impacts on fertility, pregnancy and reproduction are established in these groups.”
Vaccine Researcher: Menstrual Changes Related to Shot
Women across the U.S. have reported changes in their menstrual cycles following COVID-19 shots. Changes include heavier, earlier and more painful periods,16 as well as unexpected breakthrough bleeding or spotting among women on long-acting contraception or those who are postmenopausal and hadn’t had a period in years or even decades.17 Health officials have tried to brush off the reports, but they’ve become too numerous to ignore.
Gunnveig Grødeland, a Norwegian vaccine researcher with the University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, told TV2.no, “There are sufficient numbers of women who are experiencing changes, not just in Norway, but also abroad, to make it likely that this is connected to the vaccine.”18,19
The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) is currently studying menstrual bleeding in 60,000 Norwegian women aged 11 to 80 years to explore whether irregularities are linked to COVID-19 injections.
“We cannot rule out that there is a connection between these menstrual irregularities and the vaccine. We take these reports seriously and are doing a thorough job in order to study possible correlations,” Lill Trogstad with the NIPH told TV2.no.20
Kate Clancy, a human reproductive ecologist and associate professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and Katharine Lee, a biological anthropologist studying women’s health at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, also have more than 140,000 reports from those who’ve had changes in their period following COVID-19 injections, which they’re formally documenting in an open-ended study.21
Another 30,000 reports of period changes following the jabs have been reported to the U.K.’s regulator.22 The implication is that the shots could be having an effect on fertility, but officials have been quick to deny such a link.
However, in an editorial published in the BMJ, Victoria Male, a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, stated that when it comes to menstrual changes after COVID-19 shots, “A link is plausible and should be investigated.”23 According to Male:24

“Menstrual changes have been reported after both mRNA and adenovirus vectored covid-19 vaccines, suggesting that, if there is a connection, it is likely to be a result of the immune response to vaccination rather than a specific vaccine component. Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) has also been associated with menstrual changes.

… Biologically plausible mechanisms linking immune stimulation with menstrual changes include immunological influences on the hormones driving the menstrual cycle or effects mediated by immune cells in the lining of the uterus, which are involved in the cyclical build-up and breakdown of this tissue. Research exploring a possible association between covid-19 vaccines and menstrual changes may also help understand the mechanism.”
You Can’t Make an Informed Decision Without the Facts
At this time, women aren’t being warned about the potential risks for miscarriage, menstrual irregularities and even fertility that have been uncovered. But it’s an urgent matter that must be investigated so people can make an informed decision before consenting to an injection that could have serious reproductive effects.
It should be widely known, however, that Janci Chunn Lindsay, Ph.D., a prominent toxicologist and molecular biologist who works with M.D. Anderson Cancer Center-Houston, spoke at the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting April 23, 2021.
The focus of the meeting was blood clotting disorders following COVID-19 shots, and Lindsay spoke during the public comment period, calling for “all gene therapy vaccines” to “be halted immediately due to safety concerns on several fronts,” including fertility.25 Lindsay warned that severe red flags exist that an entire generation could be at risk of sterilization if COVID-19 shots aren’t stopped until more research is conducted:26

“We simply cannot put these [vaccines] in our children who are at .002% risk for Covid mortality, if infected, or any more of the child-bearing age population without thoroughly investigating this matter. [If we do], we could potentially sterilize an entire generation. Speculation that this will not occur and a few anecdotal reports of pregnancies within the trial are not sufficient proof that this is not impacting on a population-wide scale.”"

There are now 927,740 cases reported to VAERS following COVID-19 shots for the past 11 months, out of the total of 1,782,453 cases in the entire VAERS database filed for the past 30+ years.


Left image source, Right image source.

That means that 52% off ALL vaccine adverse reaction cases in VAERS for the past 30+ years have been reported in the last 11 months following the COVID-19 shots.

In addition, 68% of all deaths following vaccines reported in VAERS for the past 30+ years have been reported in the last 11 months following the COVID-19 shots.

We are on pace to see 21,307 deaths reported in the first year following the experimental COVID-19 shots, while the average yearly deaths reported after FDA-approved vaccines for the past 30+ years is 305 deaths.

That is an astounding 86% increase in reported deaths following the COVID-19 shots, a 70X increase over the average reported deaths following vaccinations for the past 30+ years!

FDA-approved vaccines: 305 deaths per year
COVID-19 EUA shots: 21,307 deaths per year
And as Dr. Jessica Rose has previously reported, the under-reporting factor in VAERS for the COVID-19 shots is 41X, as a conservative number, which means that at least 800,812 people have now died following COVID-19 shots based on the VAERS data.

Most, if not all, of those deaths are being reported in the pharma-owned corporate media as “COVID” deaths, as there are now more recorded “COVID deaths” for the first 11 months of 2021 than there were for the entire year in 2020, when there were no COVID vaccines until December. (Source.)



Record Number of Fetal Deaths Following COVID-19 Shots
As of this most recent update in VAERS, we have now found 2,809 fetal deaths following COVID-19 shots injected into pregnant and child-bearing women for the past 11 months. (Source.)

By way of contrast, using the exact same search parameters in VAERS, but excluding the COVID-19 shots, we found 2,168 fetal deaths following all FDA-approved vaccines for the past 30+ years. (Source.)

That’s an average of 72 fetal deaths per year following all FDA-approved vaccines for the past 30+ years, compared to what is on pace to be 3064 fetal deaths in 1 year following COVID-19 shots.

FDA-approved vaccines: 72 fetal deaths per year
COVID-19 EUA shots: 3064 fetal deaths per year
That is an 80% increase in fetal deaths recorded in VAERS following the COVID-19 shots. And yet, the CDC and FDA continue to recommend these EUA shots for pregnant women and nursing mothers.

Not only do they recommend these shots for pregnant women, we now have ample evidence that they have known since earlier this year that these shots are dangerous to pregnant women, and causing fetal deaths.

In a March 4, 2021 Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV) meeting, the CDC submitted a report that contained a section titled: Maternal vaccination safety summary (starting on p. 39).

They stated (emphasis mine – my comments in red):

* Pregnant women were not specifically included in pre-authorization clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines
– Post-authorization safety monitoring and research are the primary ways to obtain safety data on COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy
* Larger than expected numbers of self-reported pregnant women have registered in v-safe
* The reactogenicity profile and adverse events observed among pregnant women in v-safe did not indicate any safety problems (based on what criteria???)
* Most reports to VAERS among pregnant women (73%) involved non-pregnancy specific adverse events (e.g., local and systemic reactions)
* Miscarriage was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific adverse event to VAERS; numbers are within the known background rates based on presumed COVID-19 vaccine doses administered to pregnant women (no supporting evidence to backup these claims)

It is important to note through all of this reporting by the CDC that these are based on self-reporting data from pregnant women.

We know that it is politically incorrect to blame any health issue on a COVID-19 “vaccine,” and that doctors and nurses are pressured to NOT report these, so how many pregnant women had an adverse reaction, like a miscarriage, and never even thought to link it to their COVID-19 shot?

So back in March of this year (2021), there were already major concerns about the effects of the shots on pregnant women, as “larger than expected” pregnant women were reporting adverse reactions, and “the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific adverse event to VAERS” was “miscarriage.”

Then in August of this year (2021), the CDC presented a “new study” with “new data.”

Again, this “data” is dependent on pregnant women “self-reporting” adverse reactions, so we know these reports will be well below what was actually happening in the population, as it is politically incorrect to report any adverse reactions related to the experimental COVID-19 shots. To do so is to be branded an “anti-vaxxer” and shame you for life.

The August update admitted that 13% of the pregnant women who had received a COVID-19 shot reported a miscarriage. The CDC brushed this aside by stating “miscarriage typically occurs in about 11-16% of pregnancies.”

But of course ALL miscarriages are reported somewhere in the medical files, which is why they can even come up with a number range like this. So this figure is based on 100% of the reported data, while the COVID-19 related miscarriages are only based on what was self-reported, and we have no idea how many women never reported their miscarriages because they never related it to their COVID-19 shot.

One the main studies the CDC allegedly relied upon to declare that COVID-19 shots were safe for pregnant women, was a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 17, 2021.

But on October 14, 2021, they issued a statement stating that some of their data was wrong in the June 17th study. (Source.) It dealt specifically with pregnancies in their 20th week or earlier.

“No denominator was available to calculate a risk estimate for spontaneous abortions, because at the time of this report, follow-up through 20 weeks was not yet available for 905 of the 1224 participants vaccinated within 30 days before the first day of the last menstrual period or in the first trimester. Furthermore, any risk estimate would need to account for gestational week–specific risk of spontaneous abortion.” (Source.)

In this video we produced in October, Dr. Byram Bridle in Canada and Dr. Martin Kulldorff of Harvard Medical School discuss the significance of this error made in this study which determined CDC policy on Fox News with Laura Ingraham. (It is in the second half of the video after the examples of adverse events on infants.)

Since then, researchers in New Zealand have conducted a new study on the original data, and concluded:

A re-analysis of these figures indicates a cumulative incidence of spontaneous abortion ranging from 82% (104/127) to 91% (104/114), 7–8 times higher than the original authors’ results. (Source.)

And yet, the CDC and FDA still continue to recommend the shots for pregnant women, even though a correct analysis on the original data shows that 82% to 91% of pregnant women will suffer miscarriages if their unborn child is less than 20 weeks old. (Source.)

We also have evidence that Pfizer knew about the risk of their COVID-19 shots to pregnant women.

In May of this year (2021), we published a report written by Bud Shaver of Abortion Free New Mexico based on a whistleblower who served on a COVID-19 task force and had found documents that Pfizer had submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to authorize the shots in Europe, which included animal trials that showed there were serious birth defects occurring in rat specimens.

The Pfizer factsheets state that pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss their options with their healthcare providers. Although the U.S. FDA has not released the full study details provided to them for approval of the emergency use authorization (EUA), the European Medicines Agency has.

The full study documents are available at www.ema.europa.eu.

According to the reproduction toxicity study on the Pfizer product, performed in pregnant rats: “There was an increase (~2x) of pre-implantation (pregnancy) loss”and,“a very low incidence of gastroschisis, mouth/jaw malformations, right sided aortic arch, and cervical vertebrae abnormalities.”

They claim that these pregnancy reductions are within normal histological ranges, however, they were consistently seen, and are likely statistically significant. Gastroschisis is where the intestines grow outside of the body.

Right-sided aortic arch means the heart has basically formed in the wrong direction (the aortic arch should be on the left side). (Source.)

This would support what we have found in VAERS regarding “ectopic pregnancies” following COVID-19 shots, which have been reported at 50 X more than reported following ALL vaccines for the past 30+ years. See:

VAERS Data Reveals 50 X More Ectopic Pregnancies Following COVID Shots than Following ALL Vaccines for Past 30 Years
Last month, November, 2021, we published the report written by Attorney Aaron Siri, a Vaccine Injury attorney, who is suing the FDA on behalf of several physicians who are the plaintiffs and have chosen to put their careers on the line to dare to expose vaccine deaths and injuries caused by the experimental COVID-19 shots.

Attorney Siri wrote that Pfizer had requested to take 55 years to supply their trial data on the COVID-19 shots.

The FDA has asked a federal judge to make the public wait until the year 2076 to disclose all of the data and information it relied upon to license Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine.   That is not a typo.   It wants 55 years to produce this information to the public.

So, let’s get this straight. The federal government shields Pfizer from liability.  Gives it billions of dollars.  Makes Americans take its product.  But won’t let you see the data supporting its product’s safety and efficacy.  Who does the government work for? (Source.)

In a follow up article he published on November 19, 2021, he reported that the judge was forcing Pfizer to start releasing the data, and that they had released the first 91+ pages.

Two months and one day after it was sued, and close to 3 months since it licensed Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine, the FDA released the first round of documents it reviewed before licensing this product.  The production consisted of 91 pdf pages, one xpt file, and one txt file. You can download them here.

While it is for the scientists to properly analyze, let me share one observation.  One of the documents produced is a Cumulative Analysis of Post-Authorization Adverse Event Reports of [the Vaccine] Received Through 28-Feb-2021, which is a mere 2 ½ months after the vaccine received emergency use authorization (EUA).  This document reflects adverse events following vaccination that have completed Pfizer’s “workflow cycle,” both in and outside the U.S., up to February 28, 2021.

Pfizer explains, on page 6, that “Due to the large numbers of spontaneous adverse event reports received for the product, [Pfizer] has prioritised the processing of serious cases…” and that Pfizer “has also taken a [sic] multiple actions to help alleviate the large increase of adverse event reports” including “increasing the number of data entry and case processing colleagues” and “has onboarded approximately [REDACTED] additional fulltime employees (FTEs).”  Query why it is proprietary to share how many people Pfizer had to hire to track all of the adverse events being reported shortly after launching its product.

As for the volume of reports, in the 2 ½ months following EUA, Pfizer received a total of 42,086 reports containing 158,893 “events.”  Most of these reports were from the U.S. and disproportionately involved women (29,914 vs. 9,182 provided by men) and those between 31 and 50 years old (13,886 vs 21,325 for all other age groups combined, with another 6,876 whose ages were unknown).  Also, 25,957 of the events were classified as “Nervous system disorders.” (Source.)

So by the end of February of this year (2021), as Pfizer was petitioning the FDA for full approval of their EUA COVID-19 shot, they already had data from 42,086 reports containing 158,893 “events,” disproportionately affecting women between the ages of 31 and 50.

In Pfizer’s “postmarketing” report, found here, there is a Table, Table 6, labeled “Description of Missing Information” for “Use in Pregnancy and lactation,” which covers 274 cases and states:

Pregnancy cases: 274 cases including:

• 270 mother cases and 4 foetus/baby cases representing 270 unique pregnancies (the 4 foetus/baby cases were linked to 3  mother cases; 1 mother case involved twins).
• Pregnancy outcomes for the 270 pregnancies were reported as spontaneous abortion (23), outcome pending (5), premature birth with neonatal death, spontaneous abortion with intrauterine death (2 each), spontaneous abortion with neonatal death, and normal outcome (1 each). No outcome was provided for 238 pregnancies (note that 2 different outcomes were reported for each twin, and both were counted).

• 146 non-serious mother cases reported exposure to vaccine in utero without the occurrence of any clinical adverse event.  The exposure PTs coded to the PTs Maternal exposure during pregnancy (111), Exposure during pregnancy (29) and  maternal exposure timing unspecified (6). Trimester of exposure was reported in 21 of these cases: 1st trimester (15 cases), 2nd trimester (7), and 3rd trimester (2).
• 124 mother cases, 49 non-serious and 75 serious, reported clinical events, which occurred in the vaccinated mothers. Pregnancy related events reported in these cases coded to the PTs Abortion spontaneous (25), Uterine contraction during pregnancy, Premature rupture of membranes, Abortion, Abortion missed, and Foetal death (1 each).
• 4 serious foetus/baby cases reported the PTs Exposure during pregnancy, Foetal growth restriction, Maternal exposure during pregnancy, Premature baby (2 each), and Death neonatal (1). Trimester of exposure was reported for 2 cases (twins) as occurring during the 1st trimester.

This was the data that the FDA used to approve the Pfizer COVID-19 shot.

They also provided data to the FDA for breastfeeding babies that clearly indicated the shots were affecting these babies.

Breast feeding baby cases: 133, of which:
• 116 cases reported exposure to vaccine during breastfeeding (PT Exposure via breast milk) without the occurrence of any  clinical adverse events;
• 17 cases, 3 serious and 14 non-serious, reported the following clinical events that occurred in the infant/child exposed to vaccine via breastfeeding: Pyrexia (5), Rash (4), Infant irritability (3), Infantile vomiting, Diarrhoea, Insomnia, and Illness (2 each), Poor feeding infant, Lethargy, Abdominal discomfort, Vomiting, Allergy to vaccine, Increased appetite, Anxiety,
Crying, Poor quality sleep, Eructation, Agitation, Pain and Urticaria (1 each).

Breast feeding mother cases (6):
• 1 serious case reported 3 clinical events that occurred in a mother during breast feeding (PT Maternal exposure during  breast feeding); these events coded to the PTs Chills, Malaise, and Pyrexia
• 1 non-serious case reported with very limited information and without associated AEs. (Source.)

And this was at the end of February. We can clearly see what the results have been on unborn children since then just based on the limited data reported to VAERS, where there has been an 80% increase in fetal deaths recorded in VAERS following the COVID-19 shots.

Now I’m just a reporter sitting behind a computer accessing this publicly available data so that I can report it to you.

You can be certain that the scientists and researchers working at Pfizer, the FDA, and the CDC have access to all of this data as well.

This article alone, with all the links to the publicly available data, has more than enough information to immediately issue arrest warrants for Rochelle Walensky, the director of the CDC, Janet Woodcock, the FDA director, and Albert Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer, for mass murder and crimes against humanity.

But is there an attorney anywhere in the United States who would issue these warrants?

We can pretty much rule out Biden’s Attorney General for the U.S., Merrick Garland.

Are there any attorney generals in the 50 United States who would have the courage and the blessing of their Governor to issue arrest warrants like this?

Not likely, as not a single governor of any state, whether Red or Blue, has taken any actions to protect life and arrest the criminals behind these bioweapon shots.

But since these are federal agencies, the FDA and CDC, that affect every single citizen of the United States, a county District Attorney could issue warrants and try to serve them. They would mostly likely need something like a militia group, perhaps comprising of Sheriff deputies and members of their State National Guard, to be able to attempt something like this.

But if nothing is done at all, these deaths will continue to climb, as they are now injecting children between the ages of 5 and 11, and are getting ready to inject babies soon between the ages of 6 months and 4-years-old, just after the first of the year.

Is this the United States you want to live in and be a part of? How long are we going to stand by and watch innocent people killed to fulfill the Globalists’ eugenic plans to reduce our population?"

 ""Be sure to wear a mask, because the new COVID-Omicron variant coronavirus is different, deadly and not easy to detect correctly:-
 The symptoms of the new COVID-Omicron virus are as follows:-
   1. No cough.
   2. No fever.
   There will only be many:-
   3. Joint pain.
   4. Headache.
   5. Pain in the neck.
   6. Upper body back pain.
   7. Pneumonia.
   8. Under normal circumstances, no appetite
 Of course, the toxicity of COVID-Omicron is 5 times higher than that of the Delta variant, and the mortality rate is also higher than that of Delta.
 It takes less time for the disease to progress to extreme severity, and sometimes there are no obvious symptoms.
  Let us be more careful!
 This virus strain does not reside in the nasopharynx area, it directly affects the lungs, which is the ""window"", and the duration is relatively short.
 Several patients who had been diagnosed with Covid Omicron were eventually diagnosed as having no fever and no pain, but mild chest pneumonia was found on X-rays.
 The result of nasal swab test for COVID-Omicron is usually negative, and the number of false negative cases of nasopharyngeal test is increasing.
 This means that the virus will spread in the community and directly infect the lungs, leading to viral pneumonia and then causing acute respiratory pressure.
 This explains why Covid-Omicron has become highly harmful, the virus is highly virulent, and the fatal rate is high.
 Please be careful, avoid crowded places, keep a distance of 1.5m even in open places, wear a double-layer mask, wear suitable masks, and wash your hands frequently when everyone has no symptoms (coughing or sneezing)  Time).
  This Covid Omicron *""WAVE""* is more deadly than the first wave of Covid-19.  So we must be very careful and take *all kinds of measures to strengthen the prevention of coronavirus*.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_687477,"Election investigations currently taking place in Wisconsin have yielded some shocking results.
A conservative law firm based out of Milwaukee, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, conducted the investigation.
According to their findings, precisely 54,259 ballots were “cast by individuals who have never shown a voter ID in any election.”
“While we cannot infer any malignant intent on the part of these voters, this means that many votes were cast without the requirement of photo identification. 54,259 ballots were cast by individuals who have never shown a voter ID in any election. 3,718 were cast from addresses that were on the 2019 Mover’s List. 7,747 failed their DMV check when they registered,” the law firm’s report reads.
The 54,259 number is especially shocking given that Joe Biden won the state of Wisconsin by a mere 20,000 votes, according to Politico.

The institute arrived at these findings after performing a statistical analysis of the vote totals of nearly 20,000 ballots and 29,000 absentee ballot envelopes.
Surveys, polling and tens of thousands of documents attained from various public records requests were also reviewed in the case.
Now, no matter what, there is no evidence that widespread, election-altering, coordinated efforts of voter fraud stole the 2020 election away from Donald Trump.
In fact, the Wisconsin Insitute for Law and Liberty even admitted as much in their review.

“This does not necessarily mean that Biden did not win a majority of eligible votes. We looked for evidence that failure to follow proper procedures was exploited to commit fraud … there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud,” the review’s conclusion reads.
“In all likelihood, more eligible voters cast ballots for Joe Biden than Donald Trump.”
That being said, in the wake of COVID, many election procedures were altered and many mistakes were made, including in the state of Wisconsin.
“It seems clear that voters abandoned the rules for voting indefinitely confined, drop boxes were used, at least one ballot harvesting event was conducted without statutory authorization, absentee balloting in nursing homes was conducted contrary to law, ballots were cured without authorization and voter rolls were not accurately maintained as required by state and federal law,” the review’s conclusion stated.
By implementing universal mail-in voting systems, many states across the country opened up their voting systems to the possibility of fraud.

Across the country, we have already seen numerous examples of election irregularities that prove not that the election should be overturned, but rather that we, as a country, have a lot of work to do to make sure our election processes are as secure as possible.

At the famous German Christmas markets recently, something else took place. Something dark that only the COVID madness can explain. I have always believed that most left of center politicians were always champing at the bit to recognize any excuse to go full-blown totalitarian, and the COVID madness has caused the worst people with government authority to step through the hole found in Satan’s fence to use the power of government to personally feel superior over others by forcing people to do things they don’t want to do. They show no remorse because they have convinced themselves that they are right in all aspects of the COVID madness and the people they are shoving around should learn that they are being fascistic for their own good and the good of the collective. No one is safe from these power hungry zealots, not even Santa Claus.
Yes, Virginia, there are tyrants.
Police in Germany have arrested St. Nicholas at a Christmas market because Santa was not wearing a mask. The incident was captured on video and has led to some interesting and funny comments on social media, interesting and funny only because the alternative is to lose whatever faith you had left in humanity thanks to the COVID madness.
The curious incident, which raised many eyebrows, happened on Monday at the Christmas market in Stralsund, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany.
Santa Claus, who was dressed in his traditional red and white robes donning his Christmas hat, and had his face covered with a large fake beard. However, the German “Polizei” officers declared it was unsafe because Father Christmas wasn’t wearing a mask. “Santa Claus” was then arrested and dragged through the market. Das ist nicht gut für den Weihnachtsmann.
However, one Twitter user didn’t see the funny side, writing: “Germany has completely lost its mind. Germany is going stupid at an unbelievably fast pace. You just can’t make it up.
On Sunday, December 12, German police were viewed using measuring distances between people gathering in the market using folding rulers. Can you believe this?
While that was going on, video has surfaced of Santa Claus being arrested at the Stralsund Christmas Market for the crime of not wearing a mask outdoors in public.
One Twitter user posted the video and pointed out the insanity of it.
“Lol the German police are arresting Santa for not wearing a mask this is the insanity that we have reached”
WATCH:
Another user chimed in to point out how no one there confronted the police in defense of Santa.
“If this is true, then whats more insane is that no one confronted the Gestapo when they came to subdue the threat to humanity.”
One user spelled out why this incident is Hell.

Politics, research and public health have focused exclusively on the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen and consequently on vaccination as the supposed only way out of the crisis.
This is despite the fact that radiation from wireless communication technologies is known to be an omnipresent stress factor that has been linked to increased risk of cancer, DNA damage or even learning and memory disorders, among other things. In April 2021, a study by Canada’s Trent University also showed that in US cities with 5G coverage, significantly more people contracted Covid-19 and died than in cities where the population was not exposed to this radiation.1)
A study2) published in September 2021 examined this statistically significant correlation in more detail. For this purpose, the medical doctors Beverly Rubik and Robert P. Brown evaluated more than 250 research articles dealing with the effects of wireless communication radiation (WCR) in very low doses and over a long period of time on cells, animals and humans. Their analysis revealed a clear overlap between the effects of wireless communication technologies on the human body and the symptomatology of Covid-19 disease. In other words, the electromagnetic radiation from wireless technologies, including and especially 5G, can cause the same symptoms as Covid-19!
These symptoms include, for example:
Blood changes such as the money roll formation (clumping of blood cells, impairing oxygen uptake and blood circulation) and a reduction in haemoglobin
Immune system disruption, including suppression of the immune response and autoimmunity
Severe inflammation (hyperinflammation)
Increase in cellular oxidative stress (including a reduction in Glutathione levels) and increased generation of free radicals (leading to blood vessel injury and organ damage)
Increase in intracellular Calcium levels (facilitates virus penetration and multiplication)
Aggravation of cardiac rhythm disorders and heart disease
The authors conclude, based on these findings, that the long-term exposure of our bodies to wireless radiation technologies may have increased the spread and severity of Covid-19 and is a significant factor in the number of cases and deaths from Covid-19. Although the correlation found does not yet constitute proof of causality, Rubik and Brown strongly recommend that people reduce the intensity of artificial electromagnetic radiation they are exposed to (such as from mobile phones, Wi-Fi, BlueTooth, GPS, DECT phones or baby monitors) as much as possible. This is especially true for people suffering from Corona infection or Covid-19 disease.
It is also worth adding that the expansion of wireless technologies, especially 5G and Wi-Fi, in hospitals and the increased use of wireless devices in intensive care units should also be stopped immediately and these places kept free of wireless technologies so that an undisturbed healing process can take place.
The World Foundation for Natural Science has been warning about the dangers of microwave and mobile phone radiation for almost three decades In our FactSheet “The contribution of the fifth mobile phone generation 5G to the Corona pandemic”, we reported in May 2020 specifically on the correlation between the expansion of the fifth mobile phone generation (5G) and the Corona pandemic. We referred to the many studies that show how the immune system is weakened by artificial electromagnetic fields (such as those caused by mobile telephony including 5G or Wi-Fi) and even the multiplication of Corona viruses in cells is promoted.
Our short film series “How artificial electromagnetic radiation harms life” impressively shows how 5G and 5G satellites affect animals, plants, humans, water and also the Earth’s atmosphere."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_433858,"A new pre-printed (non-peer-reviewed) study on vaccine efficacy suggests that vaccinations are effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants… until they aren’t. The study, published in Yale-owned medical journal medRxiv, was conducted by the following scientists:

Christian Holm Hansen, Astrid Blicher Schelde, Ida Rask Moustsen-Helms, Hanne-Dorthe Emborg, Tyra Grove Krause, Kaare Moelbak, Palle Valentiner-Branth, The Infectious Disease Preparedness Group at Statens Serum Institute

The abstract of the study, below, says that vaccines are effective at protecting against the Omicron variant, but in the Delta variant, protection wanes “rapidly.” In just a matter of months, the jab is not effective at all, the studies find. Contrast that degree of defense against natural immunity, which can protect individuals from SARS-CoV-2 for years according to the latest information:

In this brief communication we are showing original research results with early estimates from Danish nationwide databases of vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the novel SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) up to five months after a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines. Our study provides evidence of protection against infection with the Omicron variant after completion of a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines; in particular, we found a VE against the Omicron variant of 55.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.5 to 73.7%) and 36.7% (95% CI: -69.9 to 76.4%) for the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, respectively, in the first month after primary vaccination. However, the VE is significantly lower than that against Delta infection and declines rapidly over just a few months. The VE is re-established upon revaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine (54.6%, 95% CI: 30.4 to 70.4%).

The abstract does not do a great job of explaining the most newsworthy findings, however. Deeper into the study, you can see that the scientists found that unvaccinated folks are actually 76.5% LESS likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 than those with a jab from the company.

Moderna vaccine effectiveness also provides relatively shoddy defense from the virus and its strains. Moderna customers are 39.3% more likely to contract the virus than unvaccinated people.

Rebel News chief Ezra Levant shared the study to Twitter with findings accompanying a screenshot, attached below:

“This study shows that after three months the vaccine effectiveness of Pfizer & Moderna against Omicron is actually negative. Pfizer customers are 76.5% more likely and Moderna customers are 39.3% more likely to be infected than unvaxxed people,” writes Levant:

Holy moly.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_633787,"It was reported by ConservativeBrief that Chief Justice John Roberts used his annual year-end report to push back against what he sees as increasingly “inappropriate political influence” being used in an attempt to sway the Supreme Court to rule certain ways on high-profile cases.
Constitutional scholars will tell you that our founders chose to have federal judges and Supreme Court justices serve lifetime appointments as a way to ensure they could rise above the political fray as administrations and successive congresses changed hands.

But somewhere along the way throughout our history, politicians and presidents discovered that they could permanently influence the country by choosing judges and justices who shared their political and cultural ideologies. The process of nominating judges and justices, thus, became very political.
And today, no matter how much some justices and judges protest that reality, it is still true: Presidents do not nominate jurists who do not share their political views, and the Senate typically does not confirm judges who don’t align with their party’s ideologies.
And as such, now the process has become so overtly political it has alarmed Roberts and other federal court watchers who know that the supposed independence of the Judicial Branch is at risk of becoming a policy enforcement wing of the current party in charge and that threats from outside political forces can serve as a means to ensure a ‘correct’ ruling.
“Decisional independence is essential to due process, promoting impartial decision-making, free from political or other extraneous influence,” Roberts, who serves as head of the entire federal judiciary, noted in his report on the status of SCOTUS and the 107 federal district and appeals courts around the nation.
Roberts noted another area of importance: “The Judiciary’s power to manage its internal affairs insulates courts from inappropriate political influence and is crucial to preserving public trust in its work as a separate and co-equal branch of government.”"

Since the 2020 election, Raffensperger has spent all of his time covering up the voter fraud that occurred. He is basically investigating himself. He will find himself innocent.
True the Vote has tons of videos that show 240 people who were making late-night runs to the drop boxes sponsored by a non-profit financed by Mark Zuckerberg. They would visit several boxes a night, and empty backpacks full of votes at each one. This evidence was given to Raffensperger months ago, but after one of the ballot harvesters came forward and told his story he can no longer ignore it. But, that doesn’t mean it will be an honest investigation.
John Solomon at Just the News reported this evening:
Georgia authorities have launched an investigation into an allegation of systematic ballot harvesting during the state’s 2020 general election and subsequent U.S. Senate runoff and may soon issue subpoenas to secure evidence, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger confirmed to Just the News.
Georgia law strictly prohibits third-party activists from picking up and delivering ballots on behalf of voters, a tactic called “harvesting” that liberal organizers have tried to get legalized in many battleground states without success. The U.S. Supreme Court this summer rejected Democrat efforts to overturn an Arizona law that outlawed harvesting in the battleground state.

Also, it is true that:
Raffensperger also reviewed and rejected claims by former President Donald Trump of widespread fraud during the 2020 election in a series of contacts under investigation by a local district attorney in Atlanta and the Jan. 6 select committee in Congress.
Raffensperger taped that conversation with Trump and then tried to destroy the tape that would allow him to lie about what was said, but unfortunately for him, a copy survived and was made public. So, if you are expecting an honest investigation, then I am afraid you will be awfully disappointed. The good people of Georgia need to take out the trash, beginning with Raffensperger."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_309240,"The results are in from the world’s largest study of ivermectin for COVID-19.

Researchers in Brazil found that regular use of ivermectin as a prophylactic agent was associated with significantly reduced COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and mortality rates.

The study was conducted in Itajaí, a port city in the state of Santa Catarina, between July and December 2020. Study authors include FLCCC physicians Dr. Flavio Cadegiani and Dr. Pierre Kory. Lead author Dr. Lucy Kerr was approached by the mayor of Itajaí, after the city began to experience a severe outbreak of COVID.

The entire population of Itajaí was invited to participate in the program, which involved a medical visit to compile baseline, personal, demographic, and medical information. In the absence of contraindications, ivermectin was offered as a preventative treatment, to be taken for two consecutive days every 15 days at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day.

Of the 223,128 citizens of Itajaí considered for the study, a total of 159,561 subjects elected to participate: over 70% opted to take ivermectin, and 23% chose not to.

Reduced infection and hospitalization rates
The study found a 44% reduction in COVID-19 infection rate in favor of the group that took ivermectin (3.5% versus 8.2%).

In cases where a participating citizen of Itajaí became ill with COVID-19, they were recommended not to use ivermectin or any other medication in early outpatient treatment. Of those who did become infected, two equal-sized, highly matched groups (one that used ivermectin as a prophylaxis and one that did not) were compared. The regular use of preventative ivermectin led to a 68% reduction in COVID-19 mortality (0.8% versus 2.6%), and a 56% reduction in hospitalization rate (1.6% versus 3.3%).


The regular use of preventative ivermectin led to a reduction in COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and mortality.
Study methods
Since vaccines were not available at the time, and few prophylactic alternatives existed in the absence of vaccines, Itajaí initiated a population-wide government program for COVID-19 prophylaxis. This was a prospective observational study that allowed subjects to self-select between treatment vs. non-treatment. The use of ivermectin was optional and based on patients’ preferences, given its benefits as a preventative agent was unproven.

To ensure the safety of the population, a computer program was developed to compile and maintain all relevant demographic and clinical data. All subjects were weighed to be able to accurately calculate the correct dose of ivermectin. In addition, a brief medical evaluation was conducted to record past medical history, comorbidities, use of medications and contraindications to drugs.

The following variables were analyzed and adjusted as confounding factors or used for balancing and matching groups for propensity score matching:

Age

Sex

Previous diseases (myocardial infarction and stroke)

Pre-existing comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, cancer [any type], and other pulmonary diseases)

Smoking

Patients who presented signs or the diagnosis of COVID-19 before July 7, 2020, were excluded from the sample. Other exclusion criteria included contraindications to ivermectin and age (subjects below 18 years of age were excluded).

During the study, subjects who were diagnosed with COVID-19 underwent a specific medical visit to assess clinical manifestations and disease severity. All subjects with symptoms were recommended not to use ivermectin, nitazoxanide, hydroxychloroquine, spironolactone, or any other drug claimed to be effective against COVID-19. The city did not provide or support any specific pharmacological outpatient treatment for subjects infected with COVID-19.

Intriguing findings
Interestingly, the group who self-selected to take ivermectin was older and had more comorbidities than the group who opted for no treatment. These results show that prophylactic ivermectin may be a mitigating factor in groups with higher risk of morbidity.


The results show prophylactic ivermectin may be a mitigating factor for high-risk groups.
The belief that preventative and early treatment therapies would cause people to relax their caution of remaining socially distanced, leading to more COVID-19-related infections, is not supported here.

The data demonstrate that using preventative ivermectin significantly lowers the infection rate, and that benefits outweigh the speculated increased risk of changes in social behaviors."

This little girl was arrested because she didn’t have a vaccine card in the museum.

Setting aside all the obvious reasons why this is a tragedy and reflection of a society that has completely lost its soul. There is one truth that most of you know nothing about which makes this act even more intolerable.

Law enforcement is not compelled to make arrests. Arrests are a purely discretionary function under the constitutional powers and authority granted to the executive branch of government.

This means that even if this child had committed an act warranting arrest, police had the discretion to refrain from making an arrest. In other words, in this case, police could have called a parent or guardian, ensure that the child left the area that required a vaccine or a whole host of other alternatives, including doing nothing at all.

Understanding that police absolutely DID NOT have to arrest this child, I AM OUTRAGED!!! Every single law enforcement officer involved in this decision, from the arresting cops, up the chain of command, should be FIRED!!’"

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_166008,"Military medical whistleblowers have come forward with a trove of data on vaccine safety that they claim is the most accurate available.
On Monday, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) hosted ""COVID-19: A Second Opinion,"" a livestreamed discussion panel featuring world-renowned doctors and medical experts who provided an alternative take on the public health response to COVID-19.
One of the panelists was Ohio attorney Thomas Renz, who is representing clients who have brought lawsuits against the COVID vaccine mandates, The Blaze reported.
Renz's whistleblower clients found information on common vaccine injuries in DOD medical billing data from the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database (DMED).
The DMED is the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch's (AFHSB) ""web-based tool to remotely query de-identified active component personnel and medical event data contained within the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS).""
The database contains every International Classification of Diseases (ICD) medical billing code for all medical diagnoses submitted by the military for medical insurance billing.
In sworn statements that Renz intends to submit in court, three military doctors — Samuel Sigoloff, Peter Chambers, and Theresa Long — detailed the information they found.
Renz said that according to the data the doctors found, there was a 300% increase in miscarriages in the military during the first 10 months of 2021 over the five-year average.
From 2016 through 2020, there were 1,499 codes for miscarriages each year, TheBlaze reported. From January through October 2021, there were 4,182.
The doctors analyzing the data queried the numbers for hundreds of codes throughout the five-year time period. The codes that were examined are generally for ailments that have been established as potential adverse effects of the vaccines in medical literature, according to the news outlet.
During 2020, the number of miscarriage codes dipped slightly below the five-year average at 1,477. But the billing codes were not sufficently below the average in any particular category to suggest that a 2020 decrease in doctor's visits during pandemic lockdowns accounted for the subsequent increase in 2021 diagnoses.
While the database includes ICD codes for both military hospital visits and ambulatory visits, the data Renz presented is from ambulatory diagnosis data.
Johnson mentioned during the panel that data on myocarditis cases appears to have been doctored, as the whistleblowers found that the number of codes for the diagnosis was about 28 times higher in August 2021 than when they checked again this month, where it was only two times higher.
""[T]here appears to be doctoring of the data,"" Johnson said. ""Now, my staff has already sent — this morning, we sent a record preservation letter to the Department of Defense to try and protect this data.""
According to the data found by the military doctors, there was also a nearly 300% increase in cancer diagnoses, from a 38,700-per-year average to 114,645 in 2021.
For neurological issues diagnosis codes, there was a more than 1,000% increase in 2021 over the five-year average, from 82,000 to 863,000. Renz noted during the panel that neurological issues ""would affect our pilots.""
""Our soldiers are being experimented on, injured, and sometimes, possibly, killed,"" he added.
Additional data The Blaze received from Renz showed: a 269% increase in myocardial infarction, 291% increase in Bell’s palsy, 156% increase in congenital malformations of military members' children, 471% increase in female infertility, and 467% increase in pulmonary embolisms.
The news outlet reported that one of the sworn declarations from one of the military doctors said, ""It is my professional opinion that the major increases (sic) incidences of the above discussed instances of miscarriages, cancers, and disease were due to COVID-19 'vaccinations.'""
The codes for the diagnoses are not representative of the number of people who were diagnosed with these ailments, but simply the total number of diagnoses, as one person could have multiple ailments.
The Department of Defense had not responded to a request for comment as of this article's publication deadline."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_205529,"A trailer-full of nearly one hundred wild monkeys CRASHED on its route to an unidentified Centers for Disease Control (CDC) lab in the Midwest. Three of the monkeys broke free from their cages on Route 54, close to I-80 in Danville, Pennsylvania. The monkeys came in close contact with some unidentified motorists who stopped at the scene of the crash. The driver of the truck hit a dump truck, but he was not harmed. After the accident, he was in a panic and acted suspiciously. This is according to an eyewitness report from Michelle Fallon, a woman who arrived at the scene of the crash.

She said the driver was more concerned that the details of the incident would leak to the press. When the driver was confronted by a local Press-Enterprise reporter, he allegedly put his hand in front of the camera. The driver is identified as Cody M. Brooks, a thirty-one-year-old male from Keystone Heights, Florida. His passenger, Daniel G. Adkins of Florahome, FL, was injured and transported to the Geisinger Medical Center.

Michelle Fallon said the driver “was very, very upset.”  When she checked on him immediately after the crash, he said he was carrying “cats.” When she looked inside the trailer, she saw monkeys. “He was in a panic,” and didn’t want cameras at the scene, she iterated. Why did the driver lie? What did the driver want to hide? Were the escaping monkeys carrying disease? Why wasn’t the trailer properly marked, warning about its potential bio-hazardous contents? The driver has since been charged.

Woman who came in contact with “escaping monkeys” gets quarantined, comes down with pink-eye and a cough

Three escaped monkeys were tracked down in the woods and immediately euthanized. The woman who gave eyewitness testimony was also in the vicinity of the three “escaping monkeys.” One of the monkeys reportedly “hissed” at her. She was eventually approached by a representative for the CDC. The representative told her that the CDC and the Pennsylvania Department of Health would be in touch with her. The CDC advised her to watch for symptoms and alert her doctor if she came down ill with certain symptoms. Now, she is reportedly sick with cold-like symptoms, a cough and pink-eye. When she visited the Geisinger Medical Center ER, she was given four rabies shots and a 14-day course of Valacyclovir — an antiviral drug that treats cold sores, chickenpox and shingles. She is being monitored closely.

“This has been a nightmare,” she said. “I had no idea doing a good deed like this could get me a rabies shot and put me in this situation.”

Mrs. Fallon received a letter from the CDC stating that the monkeys were imported earlier that day from Mauritius, an island off the coast of Africa. The remaining monkeys that were not euthanized are also in quarantine and are being monitored for disease. The USDA is currently investigating the euthanizing of the three monkeys, per a request from the group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

The CDC warned that the nonhuman primates (NHPs) can carry many diseases and must be handled with the proper personal protection equipment, including NIOSH-approved N95 respirators, face shields and eye protection. Because Mrs. Fallon was within five feet of the NHPs, she was put in a 31-day quarantine period, where she will be monitored for symptoms including fever, fatigue, cough, diarrhea and vomiting.

Mrs. Fallon reported that there were other motorists who stopped at the scene and were in close contact with the monkeys. The identities and whereabouts of these people is unknown, and the police are currently trying to track them down. Could this incident be the CDC’s cover story for releasing the next bioweapon? Was a new virus strain released in Pennsylvania? This story is developing. Stay tuned."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_716021,"The Office for National Statistics has revealed without realising it that children are up to 52 times more likely to die following Covid-19 vaccination than children who have not had the Covid-19 vaccine.
Back on 20th Dec 21, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published a dataset containing details on ‘deaths by vaccination status in England’ between 1st Jan and 31st Oct 21.
The dataset contains various tables showing details such as, ‘Monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status for deaths involving COVID-19’, and ‘Monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status for non-COVID-19 deaths’.
What the dataset also includes is ‘age-standardised mortality rates by age-group and vaccination status for all deaths’, however they have conveniently left out the data for children, and only included data on age groups over the age of 18.
What they also did in the data they included is bunch all young adults together meaning the rates of death are calculated for 18-39 year-olds, a total of 22 years. But for every other age group the rates of death are calculated for a total of 10 years, with 40-49, 50-59 etc.

However, on table 9 of the ‘Deaths by Vaccination Status’ dataset, the ONS have inadvertently provided enough details on deaths among children and teenagers by vaccination status for us to calculate the mortality rates ourselves, and to put it bluntly, they are horrifying, and make it obvious as to why the ONS chose to exclude children from the mortality rates dataset.
What the ONS have done, as can be seen in the above table, is provide an age standardised mortality rate per 100,000 person-years, rather than per 100,000 population.
The reason for this is that the size of each vaccination status population has been changing all the time, due to the unvaccinated moving into the one-dose category, and the one-dose vaccinated moving into the two-dose vaccinated category throughout the year.
So by doing it this way it provides a much more accurate picture of the mortality rates because it accounts both the number of people and the amount of time a person has spent in each vaccination status.
And on table 9, the ONS have provided us with the number of deaths by vaccination status among children and teenagers, and have kindly also provided us with the person-years, meaning we can calculate the mortality rate per 100,000 person years for 10-14 year olds, and 15-19 year olds by vaccination status.
According to the ONS, between 2nd January and 31st October 2021 there were 96 deaths recorded among 10-14-year-olds who had not been vaccinated, and 160 deaths recorded among 15-19-year-olds who had not been vaccinated.

The ONS have calculated the person-years among unvaccinated 10-14 year-olds during this period to be 2,094,711, whilst they’ve calculated person-years among unvaccinated 15-19 year-olds during this period to be 1,587,072.
To work out the mortality-rate per 100,000 person years all we need to now do is divide the person-years by 100,000, and then divide the number of deaths by the answer to that equation.
So for 10-14 year-olds we perform the following calculation –
2,094,711 (person-years) / 100,000 = 20.94711
96 (deaths) / 20.94711 = 4.58
Therefore, the mortality rate per 100,000 person-years among unvaccinated 10-14-year-olds is 4.58 deaths per 100,000 person-years between 1st Jan and 31st Oct 21.
By using the same formula we find that the the mortality rate among unvaccinated 15-19-year-olds is 10.08 deaths per 100,000 person-years.
Now all we have to do is use the same formula to calculate the mortality rate among one-dose vaccinated and two dose vaccinated 10-14, and 15-19 year-olds, by using the person-years and number of deaths provided by the ONS in table 9 of their ‘Deaths by Vaccination Status’ report, which are as follows –


Here are the calculated mortality rates by vaccination status among 15-19-year-olds based on the ONS calculated person-years –


And here are the calculated mortality rates by vaccination status among 10-14-year-olds based on the ONS calculated person-years –


These figures are horrifying. The ONS data shows that between 1st Jan and 31st Oct 21, children aged 10-14 were statistically 10 times more likely to die than unvaccinated children, and teenagers aged 15-19 were statistically 2 times more likely to die than unvaccinated teenagers.
But it’s the double vaccinated figures that are truly frightening.
The ONS data shows that between 1st Jan and 31st Oct 21, teenagers aged 15-19 were statistically 3 times more likely to die than unvaccinated teenagers, but children aged 10-14 were statistically 52 times more likely to die than unvaccinated children, recording a death rate of 238.37 per 100,000 person years.

But these figures are in fact even worse than they first appear, as if they weren’t already bad enough. This is because the unvaccinated mortality rate among 10-14-year-olds includes children aged 10 and 11 who are not eligible for vaccination.
Whereas the vaccinated mortality rates do not include 10 and 11 year olds because they were not eligible for vaccination at the time, with the JCVI only recently recommending on 22nd Dec 21 that 5 to 11-year-old children deemed to be high risk should be offered a Covid-19 vaccination.
Therefore, if the Covid-19 injections were not causing the untimely deaths of children then we would actually expect to see a mortality rate that is lower among the vaccinated population than the mortality rate among the unvaccinated population, not a mortality rate that is similar, and certainly not a mortality rate 52 times higher.
This jaw dropping and horrifying data should be national headline news, and we dread to think what the numbers will be in the next update from the ONS which will include data on millions of more children who received their 1st and 2nd dose of a Covid-19 vaccine after October 31st 2021."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_507747,"For some time now Facebook has been attaching a note to virtually every posted climate change article telling readers to go to an attached link (Explore Climate Science Info) to see how “average temperature in your area is changing” with the inference being that local average temperatures changes are linked to climate change. An example is shown in one of the Facebook articles below.

I have been commenting on many of these articles with the same comment as shown below which addresses the fact that absolute temperatures are not appropriate for use in addressing climate change issues and that temperature anomaly measurements are used for that purpose.  

“Facebook is spamming all climate articles by misleading readers about temperature measurements with absolute temperature changes being driven by weather not climate change. Global temperature anomaly measurements are used by climate scientists to address global temperature climate change issues. There are 5 scientifically accepted global temperature anomaly data measurement systems used by climate scientists worldwide. These systems are NASA, NOAA and UK Met Office surface anomaly measurement systems and satellite anomaly measurement systems RSS and UAH. All 5 of these global temperature anomaly measurement systems have established that global temperature anomaly measured data have declining trends since year 2016 through 2021 with the decline being at a rate averaging -0.16 degrees C per decade (-1.6 degrees C per century). The 2016 global peak measured temperature anomaly was driven by a natural climate El Niño event not climate change. Climate alarmists hyped claim that year 2021 represents a “climate emergency” is unsupported by measured global temperature anomaly data by all 5 global measurement systems with this data declining for the past 6 years. There is no “climate emergency” (as demonstrated by global temperature anomaly measurement declines over the period 2016-2021) and claims otherwise are nothing but scientifically unsupported climate alarmism propaganda that was intended to support the now spectacularly failed COP26 climate confab debacle. See the following for details.”

After commenting the Facebook article would look as shown below.

The circled “i” refers readers to the fact that WUWT is one of those evil “climate change denial blogs that opposes the scientific consensus” with this Facebook claim being the usual climate alarmist propaganda political hype. 

The Facebook “Climate Science Center” provides a listing of about a dozen topics where allegedly climate science information is provided to inform the readers of Facebooks climate alarmism claims. The “Climate science center” is shown (in part) below and a number of these topics are briefly examined in this post regarding the “Facts about climate change” claims. 

Facebook provides an example in the “Climate science center” of the “See how average temperatures in your area are changing” by providing a graph of NOAA’s California average annual temperature data as shown below which is supposed to represent an increasing temperature trend allegedly caused by man-made climate change.

The Facebook California temperature data displays average annual absolute temperatures instead of providing temperature anomaly data that is utilized by climate scientists to address climate change issues.   

The failure of Facebook to understand the scientific difference between absolute versus temperature anomaly data measurements regarding issues associated with climate change is typical of the scientific ineptness of the climate alarmist propaganda political community as addressed in a prior WUWT article below exposing the climate science incompetence of the California Democratic Party.

This article notes the following regarding the critical scientific distinction between absolute versus temperature anomaly data measurements as follows:

“All anyone needs to do is Google “temperature anomaly” to understand the significant difference between “absolute temperature” versus “temperature anomaly” measurement data that climate scientists rely upon to address climate related temperature changes as noted below.

What do temperature anomalies mean?

Temperature anomalies are useful for deriving average surface temperatures because they tend to be highly correlated over large distances (of the order of 1000 km). In other words, anomalies are representative of temperature changes over large areas and distances.

Why do we use temperature anomalies?

Anomalies more accurately describe climate variability over larger areas than absolute temperatures do, and they give a frame of reference that allows more meaningful comparisons between locations and more accurate calculations of temperature trends.

NOAA measurements of temperature anomaly data across the contiguous 48 U. S. States (Parameter: Maximum Temperature Anomaly; Time Scale: 1-Month; Months: All Months) using its most reliable USCRN temperature anomaly measurement data system establishes that the U.S. is not experiencing increasing “extreme heat” as presented and established below using NOAA temperature anomaly data which clearly shows that the nations maximum temperature anomaly measurement data has no increasing trend and in fact has declined since temperature anomaly peaks in years 2006 and 2012.”

“NOAA maximum temperature anomaly data for the 48 contiguous states proves that the U.S. is not experiencing increasing “extreme heat” trends and Democrat claims otherwise are unsupported by scientific data. Democrats are improperly politicalizing the use of localized-weather absolute temperature events to define national, regional and global climate temperature change behavior which is scientifically invalid.”

The same lack of increasing trend profile also occurs for NOAA’s average temperature anomaly data for the 48 contiguous states as shown below. NOAA’s temperature anomaly data representing the contiguous U.S. does not support Facebooks climate alarmist claims that man made CO2 emissions are driving increasing U.S. average temperature trends and in addition Facebooks is erroneously using absolute temperatures versus temperature anomaly measurement data.

Facebook also fails to present long standing EPA data (perhaps because EPA attempted to conceal this data as addressed in a recent WUWT post) that clearly shows that the U.S. is not experiencing increased heat waves or droughts since the 1950s period with measured data covering the period between 1895 and 2020 demonstrating the greatest occurrences of heat wave and droughts occurred in the period of the 1930s as shown in EPA data presented in the diagrams below.

Additionally, NOAA’s Palmer-Z-drought index data also shows U.S. droughts declining as shown below.

One of the Facebook “Facts about climate change” addresses the use of climate models and their claim that these models have “accurately predicted” climate change impacts as noted in the Facebook Fact item presented below.

Facebook conceals the fact that the UN IPCC in its Third Annual Climate Change Report in 2001 concluded that trying to develop and utilize computer models to address future global climate change impacts will always be problematic.    

Specifically in Section 14.2.2.2 (Balancing the need for finer scales and the need for ensembles) of the AR3 report the bottom line concerning the unresolvable shortcomings of global climate model simulations was articulated and clearly presented as:

“In sum, a strategy must recognize what is possible. In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible. The most we can expect to achieve is the prediction of the probability distribution of the system’s future possible states by generation of ensembles of modal solutions.”

Furthermore, Facebook also conceals the fact that the UN IPCC acknowledged in its Fifth Annual Climate Report in 2013 that the climate model scenarios utilized to “project” climate outcomes are speculative and specifically qualified as such by noting:

“The scenarios should be considered plausible and illustrative, and do not have probabilities attached to them. (12.3.1; Box 1.1)” 

These UN IPCC significant and acknowledged limitations of climate models are clearly illustrated by comparisons of model projections of global climate temperature anomalies versus measured temperature anomalies as presented in the results shown below establishing that climate models grossly overstate global climate temperature anomaly impacts.

Another Facebook “Facts about climate change” area as shown below claims to establish that only humans can be causing climate change temperature change impacts not natural occurring climate events.

This is a completely ridiculous climate alarmist propaganda claim given that NOAA and other climate science organizations global climate temperature anomaly data clearly establishes that natural climate behavior driven EL Nino events significantly contribute to increasing global climate temperature anomaly changes as clearly presented in NOAA’s global temperature data shown below.

As the NOAA global temperature anomaly data clearly shows the peak global temperature anomaly measurement data in 2016 was directly driven by the result of a strong EL Nino event as has occurred on many other peak temperature anomaly measurement data years over the past 70 years shown in NOAA’s graph. 

Another Facebook “Facts about climate change” deceptively notes that sea level rise is occurring because of melting ice and warming oceans that represent a global climate threat, but Facebook conceals the fact that sea levels have been rising driven by natural climate behavior occurring since the end of the last ice age.

It is well established climate science that natural climate events have been controlling ocean sea level rise behavior for tens of thousands of years since the end of the last ice age as shown in the analysis presented below.

What Facebook fails to address is that coastal sea level rise is not accelerating (rate of sea level rise is not increasing) which climate alarmists have been falsely claiming for decades. NOAA tide gauge coastal sea level rise measurements at hundreds of coastal locations going back for more than a century confirm the lack of coastal sea rise acceleration as shown below from examples for New York (164 years of data measurements, the longest NOAA tide gauge record in the U.S.) and Los Angeles (97 years of data measurements) with stable sea level rise rates of 11.3 and 4.08 inches per century respectively.

Another Facebook “Facts about climate change” item claims that increasing atmospheric CO2 harms earth’s plant life.

Facebook conceals NASA Earth Observatory satellite data that shows greater global atmospheric CO2 is increasing greening of the earth as shown in their analysis below.

Another Facebook “Facts about climate change” claims that climate change is increasing the severity of droughts and wildfires.

Regional and global data confirm that droughts are not increasing in severity or occurrence frequency at either the regional or global level as shown below from both EPA and UN IPCC drought index data.

Additionally, data from NASA’s Earth Observatory satellites shows that there is no increasing trend of global wildfires but in fact there is a measured declining wildfire data trend as shown below.

Another Facebook “Facts about climate change” makes the absurd claim that the cost renewable energy is dropping rapidly.

As the energy and reliability debacle of the UK and EU continues to harshly demonstrate excessive reliance on unreliable, nondispatchable and backup power reliant renewable energy increases electric systems costs dramatically and degrades grid reliability as shown in the analysis below.

Updated EU electricity price data covering the first half of 2021 shows that Denmark and Germany who have the highest levels of renewable energy of all EU countries have electricity prices about 40% higher than the EU average (shown below) and nearly 3.5 times greater than those of the U.S.

So much for Facebooks phony propaganda claim – “The myth of expensive renewable energy is out of date.”

Facebook also has “Facts about climate change” hyping the same old incompetent Al Gore Polar Bear declining population propaganda baloney.

Dr. Susan Crockford has the most up to date survey data regarding Polar Bear populations which directly addresses the Facebook gravely out of date information regarding this subject. A summary of her results are provided below which concludes depending on location these populations are stable and growing despite declining sea ice conditions. 

“Crockford, S.J. 2021. The State of the Polar Bear Report 2020. Global Warming Policy Foundation Report 48, London.

London, 27 February: A prominent Canadian zoologist says that Facebook’s information is gravely out of date and 2020 was another good year for polar bears.

In the State of the Polar Bear Report 2020, published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) on International Polar Bear Day, zoologist Dr. Susan Crockford explains that while the climate change narrative insists that polar bear populations are declining due to reduced sea ice, the scientific literature doesn’t support such a conclusion.

Crockford clarifies that the IUCN’s 2015 Red List assessment for polar bears, which Facebook uses as an authority for ‘fact checking’, is seriously out of date. New and compelling evidence shows bears that in regions with profound summer ice loss are doing well.

Included in that evidence are survey results for 8 of the 19 polar bear subpopulations, only two of which showed insignificant declines after very modest ice loss. The rest were either stable or increasing, and some despite major reductions in sea ice. As a result, the global population size is now almost 30,000 – up from about 26,000 in 2015.

Dr. Crockford points out that in 2020, even though summer sea ice declined to the second lowest levels since 1979, there were no reports of widespread starvation of bears, acts of cannibalism, or drowning deaths that might suggest bears were having trouble surviving the ice-free season.” 

Facebook had announced earlier that they intended to commence editorializing climate change posts as reported in a prior WUWT article here.

The Facebook “Climate science center” is nothing but climate alarmist propaganda, speculation and opinion devoid of credible scientifically supported  data and analysis and just a continuation of its biased and scientifically incompetent climate alarmist political campaign that led to their falsely and inaccurately “Fact Checking” peer reviewed climate science as noted in a prior WUWT article shown below.

Facebooks climate science incompetence completely undermines its editorializing credibility on climate issues as was addressed in a recent WUWT article which appropriately characterized Facebook “Fact Checks” as fake.

The Facebook organization is completely incapable of contributing credible, accurate or noteworthy assessments of climate science information and its “Climate science center” as demonstrated by this essay is simply pure climate alarmist political propaganda trying to disguise itself as “science.”"

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_556608,"U.S. drug regulators have now approved the COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, but the approved versions of the vaccines don’t appear to be available yet in the United States.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Moderna’s jab on Jan. 31, about five months after it approved Pfizer’s shot.
The approved vaccines are known as Spikevax and Comirnaty.
In a letter to Moderna, the FDA said that there is not “sufficient” supply of either approved vaccine.
“Although Spikevax (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and Comirnaty (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) are approved to prevent COVID-19 in certain individuals within the scope of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine authorization, there is not sufficient approved vaccine available for distribution to this population in its entirety at” this time, the Jan. 31 missive states.
Comirnaty was not being distributed in the United States as of October, The Epoch Times found. Queries were sent to officials in all 50 states this week regarding the Comirnaty-branded version of the vaccine. Twelve states confirmed that they still haven’t received Comirnaty-branded vials.
“No states are receiving the Comirnaty product,” a spokeswoman for the Commonwealth of Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services told The Epoch Times in an email.
At one time, the Pfizer shot with a gray cap, which uses a different buffer, “was anticipated to have the ‘Comirnaty’ label on it, but it does not,” according to a spokesman for the Washington State Department of Health.
The state has received about 235,000 doses of the grey cap formulation, and other states have also started receiving the gray-capped product.
“The CDC has not begun to distribute the branded product, Comirnaty, yet,” a spokeswoman for the Utah Department of Health told The Epoch Times via email, adding that “our immunization program staff have not heard a timeline from CDC regarding this change.”
CDC stands for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The agency has not responded to requests for comment regarding the availability of Spikevax and Comirnaty.
The CDC says on its website that Pfizer “does not plan to produce” any of the Comirnaty-branded product since emergency use authorization (EUA) product is still available. The site hasn’t been updated with the Spikevax approval.
The FDA referred comment to the vaccine companies, which have not said when the approved vaccines will be available.
A Pfizer spokesperson told The Epoch Times last year that the company would be using the EUA-labeled product until its expiry date.
The lack of availability of the approved vaccines is significant because it means people still have the right to accept or refuse the products, according to Liberty Counsel, a legal group.
“There is currently no fully FDA-approved licensed COVID shot available to the population. Neither Comirnaty nor Spikevax are available. Everything that is available remain under the EUA law. That means that people have the option to accept or refuse the shots,” Matthew Staver, the group’s founder and chairman, said in a statement.
Liberty Counsel is representing plaintiffs in multiple cases challenging vaccine mandates, including a case against the U.S. military.
The FDA fact sheets (pdf) provided to people preparing to get a shot used to state that “under the EUA, it is your choice to receive or not receive” the vaccine, taking language from the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which lets the FDA grant EUAs.
However, some say the law doesn’t bar vaccine mandates.
The Department of Justice concluded in a legal opinion (pdf) last year that the act “does not prohibit entities from imposing vaccination requirements.”
The FDA says the authorized and approved versions of the vaccines “are legally distinct with certain differences that do not impact safety or effectiveness.” The FDA has declined to comment on this statement. Moderna did not respond to requests for comment. Pfizer has said that the products “are made using the same processes, and there are no differences between them in safety or effectiveness.” The statement, a spokesperson added, refers to “differences in manufacturing information included in the respective regulatory submissions.”

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_955692,"Year 2021 will go down in history as the “Year of the COVID-19 Vaccines” as life insurance claims skyrocketed, and the funeral industry prospered, as about 400,000 excess deaths occurred with the roll out of the COVID-19 vaccines.
Scott Davison, the CEO of OneAmerica, a $100 billion insurance company based out of Indiana, was the first one to report the excess in number of death claims in 2021 last month (January, 2022). See:
Crisis in America: Deaths Up 40% Among Those Aged 18-64 Based on Life Insurance Claims for 2021 After COVID-19 Vaccine Roll Outs
Earlier this week, Mike Adams from Natural News reported on news out of Holland where Dutch insurer Aegon revealed its third quarter 2021 life insurance payouts skyrocketed 258% compared to third quarter 2020 payouts. See:

Today, February 4, 2021, ZeroHedge News published an article with an analysis of both the Life Insurance and Funeral Industry in 2021 by a former Blackrock fund manager.
Long Funeral Homes, Short Life Insurers? Ex-Blackrock Fund Manager Discovers Disturbing Trends In Mortality
by ZeroHedge News
Four weeks ago, OneAmerica insurance company CEO Scott Davison revealed that they had witnessed ‘the highest death rates in the history of this business – not just at OneAmerica’ with a jump of ‘40% over what they were pre-pandemic.‘ Interestingly, Davison noted that the majority of deaths are not classified as due to Covid-19.
The implication to many was clear – that the Covid-19 vaccine is linked to the excess mortality, and months of vaccine injury reports were now spilling over to actuarial data – which is beginning to show, among other things, that younger, working-age people began dying in greater numbers as vaccine mandates hit – for a disease which primarily kills older, non-working age individuals. The counter argument, often presented without evidence, is that the increase is due to people who postponed elective surgeries and other medical treatments during the pandemic.
Ex-Blackrock fund manager Ed Dowd is in the former camp, and has spent the last month analyzing breadcrumbs associated with a rise in excess mortality vs. pre-pandemic levels. Given that we’re now in the middle of earnings season, there are some pretty big crumbs rolling out of the insurance and funeral services industries which are beginning to paint a disturbing picture.
A few key observations:
Mortality worsened in 2021 vs. 2020 despite widespread vaccinations
A spike in Mortality among younger, working-age individuals coincided with vaccine mandates
The spike in younger deaths peaked in Q3 2021 when Covid deaths were extremely low (but rising into the end of September)
On Tuesday, financial insurance company Unum reported that their Life segment saw an increase of 9% in their ratio of payouts vs. premiums (Benefit ratio), a 17.4% increase in 2021 vs. 2020 despite widespread vaccinations, and a 13.3% increase over 2019.
On Wednesday, Dowd noted that funeral home company Carriage Services saw a 28% increase in September 2021 vs. 2020, and a 13% increase in August vs. the same period. Funerals and cremations are up 12% and 13% respectively on the quarter.
In general, funeral homes saw an uptick in business in Q3, and Dowd will be closely monitoring Q4 reports which are expected around Feb. 15 – less than two weeks away.
Dowd also noted on Wednesday that Lincoln National’s death claims are up 13.7% y/y, and up 57% in Q4 vs. 2019. CFO Randy Frietag explained on Thursday that in 2021, the share of young people dying from Covid doubled in the second half of the year.
Meanwhile, Reinsurance Group of America noted in their Thursday earnings call that Q4 was impacted by a meaningful level of Covid-19 mortality claims despite the fact that the Covid-19 vaccines have been around for more than a year.
Also noting a spike in younger deaths which peaked in Q3 2022, is Hardford Insurance Group, which reported that mortality is up 32% from 2019 pre-covid levels, and 20% from 2020 pre-vaccine levels.
Some key questions for the insurance companies:
What are the leading causes of death for 2020 and 2021?
How many of those who died were vaccinated vs. unvaccinated?
Reinsurance Group of America, for example, reported a profit in Q4 2020 when the most of the population was unvaccinated and amid a deadlier strain of Covid-19, yet they registered a loss in Q4 2021 with more than 60% of the country fully vaccinated (and around 75% who have received at least one dose).
Perhaps this is why Pfizer is now actively fighting to suppress research data submitted to the FDA for approval – while the pharmaceutical giant and its peers continue to enjoy legal immunity from vaccine injuries.
In closing, some tongue-in-cheek non investment advice from Dowd:

In January 2019, the WHO defined the growing number of vaccination critics as one of the top ten threats to global health, and since the unprecedented Corona vaccination fiasco, the number of vaccination refusers has truly multiplied.
Meanwhile, resistance is forming even within the orthodox medical establishment. But the masterminds of the WHO continue to insist on an unrealistic vaccination coverage rate of at least 70 percent.
In this article, Jan Walter describes, with extensive source citations, which techniques are possible to still vaccinate the population, when people are becoming increasingly critical of vaccinations. This is only fueled by the continuing pressure for mass “vaccination” against a non-lethal disease for 99.8% of people, with a new type of “vaccine” that is actually gene therapy by means of mRNA. It seems like science fiction and is chilling, but the metohodes and techniques are available. There question is how far do we let it get?
Vaccinations increasingly scrutinized and the chilling alternative
In January 2019, WHO [1] defined the growing number of vaccine critics as one of the ten greatest threats to global health, and since the unprecedented corona vaccination fiasco [2], the number of vaccine refusers has really multiplied. Meanwhile, resistance is emerging even within the conventional medical community. But the masterminds at WHO continue to insist on an unrealistic vaccination rate of at least 70 percent.
Now several experts and former mainstream journalists like John O’Sullivan are warning that the massive PCR testing campaign could be a WHO vaccination program in disguise. (see Principia Scientific) [3] O’Sullivan is referring to a new technology developed at Johns Hopkins University that is supposed to make it possible to carry out covert vaccinations through a PCR test. (See Johns Hopkins Universitiy) [4]
Inspired by a parasitic worm that digs its sharp teeth into the intestines of its host, Johns Hopkins researchers have developed tiny, star-shaped micro-devices that attach to the intestinal mucosa and can deliver drugs into the body.
These tiny devices, known as “Theragrippers,” are made of metal and a thin film that changes shape. They are covered with heat-sensitive kerosene wax and each no larger than a dust particle. (See Figure 1

When the kerosene coating on the Theragripper reaches body temperature, the devices close autonomously and clamp onto the wall of the colon. Because of the sealing action, the tiny, six-pointed devices burrow into the mucosa and attach to the colon, where they are held and gradually release their drug load to the body. Eventually, the Theragripper lose their grip on the tissue and are removed from the colon through normal gastrointestinal muscle function.
Note: According to Johns Hopkins University, Theragrippers are actually administered with a cotton swab. (see Figure 2)

Figure 2: Theragrippers on a cotton swab
The Johns Hopkins University research team published positive results from an animal study as a cover article in Science Advances on October 28, 2020 [5], confirming that the new technology works flawlessly:
Here we report that GI parasite-inspired active mechanochemical therapeutic grabs, or theragrippers, can survive 24 hours in the gastrointestinal tract of live animals by autonomously adhering to mucosal tissue. We also observe a remarkable six-fold increase in elimination half-life when using ripper-mediated delivery of the model analgesic ketorolac tromethamine. These results provide excellent evidence that shape-shifting and self-locking microdevices improve the effectiveness of long-term drug delivery.

Fig.3: Shape-shifting Theragripper as self-locking drug delivery devices
Coincidentally, the PCR test in China is now also performed anally because the reliability of the results is said to be better and of course this practice is immediately supported in the Western mainstream media. (See Business Insider) [6]
Note: If you can’t imagine the government administering toxins to you against your will and without your consent, think of all the horrific experiments on humans that were admitted afterwards and which, according to Wikipedia, [7] have continued well into modern times. In 2007, the CDC [8] even admitted that between 1955 and 1963, 10-30 million citizens were infected with the carcinogen SV40 via polio vaccination.
The Vaccination that is Not a Vaccination, but Gene Therapy
In a revealing video conference [9] with Dr. Judy Mikovits, Robert Kennedy Jr. and Dr. David Martin, it is explained that the mRNA vaccine, by the legal definition, is not a vaccine at all. It is falsely called a vaccine to hide the fact that the purported vaccine is, in fact, a gene therapy.
Experienced physician and epidemiologist, Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, stated in a censored interview with Rubikon, “Actually, this ‘promising’ vaccine should be PROHIBITED for the vast majority of people because it is genetic engineering!” Mary Holland, Vice President and Chief Advocate of the Children’s Health Defense Organization, warns, “New vaccine technologies will likely lead to new types of vaccine harms. Since there has never been an approved mRNA vaccine, we really don’t know what such damage will look like. Because vaccines have been developed so quickly and clinical trials are so short, the long-term damage is completely unknown.”
What is particularly chilling is that the vast majority do not even know what the mRNA vaccine is doing in their bodies. They simply allow themselves to be blindly vaccinated, and this despite the fact that more and more independent and even orthodox medical experts are warning against it. (See doctors from around the world warn against mRNA vaccination) [10] In this context, it should not be forgotten that the American company modeRNA Therapeutics was founded in 2010 not as a vaccine manufacturer, but as a GenTech company. The example of the many Monsanto scandals makes it crystal clear that genetic engineering does not serve to protect species, but rather to gain power. The hidden agenda is to genetically modify species in order to patent or own them. Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger once said, “Whoever controls the seed controls the world.” (See Press Portal) [11]
What’s next? Are they going to patent our bodies after they genetically engineer us with the mRNA vaccine?
Dr. Carrie Madej, [12] a specialist in internal medicine with over 19 years of experience, states that the COVID-19 vaccine could actually be a Trojan horse to patent humans because it alters our DNA. According to an Article published in the British science journal Phys.org in January 2020 [13], it is confirmed that modified RNA has a direct impact on our DNA. The following passage is particularly alarming: “Several research groups are now working together to investigate what effect this may have on the DNA molecule. We already know that R-loop regions are associated with DNA sequences that contain active genes, and that this can lead to chromosome breaks and the loss of genetic information.” Also alarming is the fact that leading vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer are warning their subjects not to reproduce after vaccination (see Pfizer, p. 132) [14 PDF] By doing so, the pharmaceutical company is confirming that the mRNA vaccine can have negative effects on human reproduction and is being vaccinated in spite of it!
Conclusion: Anyone who knows a little history knows that genetic experimentation and human experimentation are nothing new. Although modern eugenics has its origins in the 19th century, the ideas, measures and justifications of state and social interventions and influences on reproduction have been known since ancient times. They can already be found in Plato’s “Politeia,” which, however, is limited to state selection and education. In the Renaissance, corresponding lines of thought can be found in the social utopian writings “Utopia” by Thomas Morus, “Nova Atlantis” by Francis Bacon and “La città del Sole” by Tommaso Campanella. But because common sense instinctively resists such interventions, the establishment has always endeavored to disguise its true intentions with misleading labels. The Nazis, for example, disguised eugenics as “hereditary health science” or “hereditary care” to make it attractive to the masses, and today the same sick agenda is sold to us with a new “vaccine” to save us from a supposed “pandemic”.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_820311,"The same day that videos emerged of Ottawa and Quebec police gearing up to go after peaceful Convoy supporters in the capital, the Ottawa government has warned protesters that their pets may be confiscated following their arrest.
Moreover, position statements issued by the Ottawa Humane Society reveal that they may unilaterally euthanize any animal that they deem to be “not suitable for adoption.” Arbitrary behavioral and health tests would be used to make the call. 
These decisions about the life of a trucker’s pet would, thus, be made without their consent or knowledge while they are imprisoned for indefinite periods of time via the Emergency Powers of the Trudeau regime.

﻿""Attention animal owners at [the] demonstration,"" Ottawa By-law writes in a Tweet. ""If you are unable to care for your animal as a result of enforcement actions, your animal will [be] placed into protective care for 8 days, at your cost. After 8 days, if arrangements are not made, your animal will be considered relinquished.""

As anyone with experience in pet care or animal shelters will know, ""relinquishment"" means that ownership of pets will be handed over to animal shelters, where the pets will be housed while awaiting a prospective owner to adopt them or to be euthanized.
As Adopt-a-Pet explains, ""When shelters run out of kennel space, sometimes even healthy adoptable dogs are put to sleep. Some shelters simply don't have the manpower to spend time with each dog, so they spend most of their time alone in a small cage… What is true at every shelter is that when you surrender a dog, what happens to him is completely out of your hands.""
It isn't clear what length of time Convoy supporters may face if arrested for peacefully protesting, but the government has been clear that it could be up to one year in prison, in addition to a possible $100,000 fine.
This move, while despicable, should come as no surprise, as authoritarian regimes often resort to such measures when under stress.

Last year, the Australian government euthanized 15 rescue dogs, including ten puppies, at an animal shelter to 'stop the spread' of COVID amongst the devastated staff.
As it stands, all Canadians continue to be held hostage following Trudeau's invoking of the Emergencies Act, with Canadians' who happened to support the Convoy financially being threatened with the possible freezing of their bank account. Dogs are just the latest target for a government in shambles."

This 'solar geoengineering' project has been called 'dangerous' and even 'horribly stupid', but could be a last resort to save the world if humanity doesn't successfully stop climate change.
Gates, who recently argued that everyone should eat lab-grown beef and stop using Bitcoin, is reportedly very interested in dimming the Sun to reduce or delay the impact of global warming around the world.

The SCoPEx project will kick off in June by launching a weather balloon 12 miles into the sky to test whether the sun-blocking dust will be feasible.
However, this 'geoengineering' test could be very risky and nobody knows what will happen until after the dust is released. Some scientists have suggested that the dust could help replenish the ozone layer.
Critically, the Sun wouldn't actually be fully blocked out. Instead, the dust would 'scatter' or reflect sunlight. This has happened in the past when volcanoes have erupted.

In the Netflix series Snowpiercer, the entire world lives on a gigantic train because humanity accidentally froze the entire planet by blocking the Sun.

Considering revelations that foreign child traffickers had kidnapped Russian children and transported them to the Ukraine to sell into child slavery, Putin on Sunday told Trump that he intends to isolate and destroy child slavery covens on Ukrainian soil.
According to Putin, the Russian Children’s Welfare Society interviewed 6 Russian children, ages 12-16, who were among the 100 multinational kids freed by Spetznas in central Ukraine Friday afternoon. They shared similar, harrowing stories. Three were abducted from their homes, at night, near the border city of Belgorod, which sits 10 miles inside the Ukrainian border. Their abductors captured them as parents worked or slept; rural southwest Russia is rife with destitution, and parents, unable to afford babysitters, often entrust God to care for their children whilst they hammer out a meager living. The remaining 3 said they’d been abducted at shopping centers, when momentarily separated from parents or guardians.
Real Raw News has not received information on circumstances surrounding other abductions.
Four of the six had endured captivity for one or two weeks, but two children had difficulty estimating their time in bondage; prolonged confinement in a dark, windowless cell had skewed their perception of time and space. One guessed “six-to-eight weeks.” And of the six, three said their jailors had shuttled them to their point of rescue from other internment camps that held “many, many, many more children.”
“Putin told Trump that, at least to the kids’ account, the traffickers all spoke fluent Ukrainian but only sparse or broken Russian, and some Armenian. They wore ski masks, so the kids never saw the faces. The total number of children there was 100, 76 Russian, 9 French, 1 Swiss, 5 American, 6 Ukrainian, not sure of others. Apparently, the Ukrainian children translated for the rest,” our source said.
Putin, our source added, said 46 are being medically treated for a broad spectrum of maladies: Malnourishment, lacerations, puncture wounds, dysentery, dehydration, respiratory infections, STDs, and sexual abuse. A 13-year-old girl had been violently sodomized.
“I will find who did this and crush them, all of them,” Putin reportedly told Trump.
“Putin claims he wants to repatriate all the kids, but since European countries have closed airspace to Russian flights, and no one will talk to him, he’s stuck in a barrel. Trump will bring our children home,” our source said.
In other news, Putin also said the Russian military had destroyed four 18-wheelers that “Western terrorists” had converted into roving bioweapon laboratories.  Moreover, he said fantastical stories about him appearing in Western media were a product of CIA invention, citing specifically a NY Post article claiming paranoia and pandemic-induced isolation had driven him mad.
As always, RRN is merely reporting what Putin told Trump; we do not know whether his words are true, partly true, or propaganda."

Ah, just what 2022 ordered – a Charli D’Amelio and Kesha collaboration! If you don’t know who either are, then you’re probably not a white girl with white Nikes and too much shit on her keychain.
Both have the exact same amount of value and have the same chance of being remembered by anyone who is registered to vote.
The key here is to draw attention to your boobs with your hands and then wonder why nobody respects you.
4. Savage Love
Yeah, that Jason DeRulo.
We don’t know.
Of course, we wouldn’t dare criticize females who are certainly above criticism although both of these types of people seem to be exclusively women or feminine men – but, regardless, everyone deserves happiness and even these… people.
Hopefully if America is invaded and the country, like Ukraine, legally obligates men to stay and fight while women go off to complain about a misrepresented pay gap in a safe space then they can come up with a Tik Tok dance to commemorate us as we are wiped away by a nuclear winter.
3. Captain Hook
Ahhh, Megan the Stallion… is there anything you can do?
If you’ve noticed a trend so far, it might have to do with who is performing these dancesand what appears to be their motivation.
But make no mistake – the reason the modern woman tries to encourage an audience to be sexually attracted to her is pure accident and is your own fault, you sack of shit.
They wear tight pants because it is comfortable. Not because it has anything to do with garnering positive attention. That is ridiculous, sexist and juvenile.
Men only wear comfortable clothing because they’re afraid of their sexuality.
Wait…
ANYWAYS, war between nuclear superpowers could be curtailed by learning this fun dance that is about female empowerment.
2. I’m a Savage
That’s right, another dance associated with Megan Thee Donkey.
Look out, Cardi B – there’s a new anthem for girls that steal money out of their mom’s purse.
This song and subsequent dance really drives home some American strengths which is lack of accountability and glorification of negative traits. That is what makes us strong. The inability to tell when we are weak.
Some key takeaways from this video you should pick up on is the fake laugh before or after the dance in order to show you don’t really care and it’s not about clout, looking good or pursuit of fame. That way, if it doesn’t work out, then you don’t even care, right? If it DOES work out… well, you’re just a small town girl who happened to make it big by posting videos every goddamn day.
Another tip is to push your tongue out the side of your open mouth, gently resting on your lips. Why? No idea.
1. Any dance, really
It really doesn’t matter which one you do as long as you make sure to film yourself and don’t make it obvious that you’re trying. Also, don’t try to be too pretty but don’t be too ugly. You have to try without trying, you know?
China would be BREAKING the INTERNET with these TIK TOK DANCES if their culture wasn’t focused on productivity and utility. You are looking at hundreds of vain, unhappy people pursuing a dream they’ll never achieve as long as there’s someone more famous than them. The unquenchable thirst of excess.
So keep motivating others to pursue social media as anything more than a tool to connect with friends or family.
It will continue to grow our culture that gratifies bad behavior, vanity and lack of accountability which will eventually lead to the problems all fixing themselves – including the Russia/Ukraine thing.
Ukraine invaded Russia or something, right? I wonder if Megan Thee Stallion has released a new song yet.. shit what booster shot are we on?

It was reported by ConservativeBrief that Vice President Kamala Harris broke out in her trademark, uncomfortable laughter when she was asked Thursday if the United States planned on making space for Ukrainian refugees as she met with foreign leaders in Poland to discuss the ongoing Russian invasion.
Both Harris and Poland’s President Andrzej Duda were asked about whether the U.S. would be accepting a greater number of Ukrainian refugees, with the VP giggling awkwardly before Duda actually took the time to answer what was a serious question, given that many of the 2 million Ukrainians who have fled the fighting are currently in his country, The Daily Wire reported, adding:
“A friend in need is a friend indeed,” Harris said with a smile before a more somber Duda said he had asked the U.S. vice president to help speed up the process for Ukrainian refugees with family in the U.S. to be able to head to America.
“We are looking for international support because indeed the vast majority of Ukrainian refugees are coming to our country,” Duda said, though Harris did not commit the U.S. to take in a certain number of Ukrainians trying to escape the war.
That said, Harris did note that Ukrainians who are currently in the United States and may have visas that are set to expire soon could remain in America for the time being.
“We will not send them back tow hat is a war zone,” she said.
She also committed the Biden administration to assist Poland.
“As we have said many times through our work collectively in the UN through NATO, we will support Poland in terms of the burden it is facing and our collective responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of these refugees,” Harris said.

In an interview with Fox News in June, The Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway noted Harris laughs nervously when she gets questions from the media that are tough or that she isn’t prepared to adequately answer, such as the migrant crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border, which President Biden put her in charge of solving.
“You are wondering, does she have a handle on this, and then she does that thing where she laughs nervously when she gets the slightest difficulty or a question or topic and it is making a lot of Americans nervous to see how nervous she is about not being able to handle the thing she was tasked with, which is the border crisis,” Hemingway said.
The White House explained the purpose of Harris’ trip in a statement.
“During her trip to Warsaw, Poland, today, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris announced nearly $53 million in new humanitarian assistance from the United States government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to support innocent civilians affected by Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine,” the statement said."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_296704,"Evidence has emerged which proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the Covid-19 virus was created by the very pharmaceutical giant that has made billions through the sale of an experimental Covid-19 injection; Moderna. On February 23 the Daily Mail ran an article showing that Moderna has patented the 19 base letter (nucleotide) sequence which codes for the Furin Cleavage site in Covid-19. 

They cited a Paper by Scientists in India, Switzerland, Italy and the US (cautiously entitled: MSH3 Homology and Potential Recombination Link to SARS-CoV-2 Furin Cleavage Site) in which they calculated that the chances of a 19 nucleotide sequence patented by Moderna randomly appearing in Covid-19 in circumstances where it does not appear anywhere else in nature are 1 in 3 trillion.

But they failed to make the obvious deduction there from. Had they made said obvious deduction I fear that might have been the last scientific deduction they ever got published!

They decided to investigate the RNA sequence for the Furin cleavage site in the Covid-19 Spike Protein to see if it occurred anywhere else in nature. .

Fortunately the NCBI/NIH have produced the wonderful BLAST database which catalogues every gene sequence in nature known to man and every synthetic patented gene sequence known to the patent office.

The researchers chose the Furin Cleavage sequence because it is the only continuous gene letter sequence (nucleotide sequence) in Covid-19 with more than 3 nucleotides, that differs from the respective letters in its closest natural relative the Bat Coronavirus RaTG13 (all other differences are 3 letters or less long). So it was by far the best candidate for determining whether or not Covid-19 was man made.

The reader might consider it more likely that a Furin Cleavage Site would appear in the Sun than in the Daily Mail. But this cleavage refers to the separation of spike from virus rather than pillow from pillow. 

Furthermore the Furin Cleavage Site is key to the pathogenicity of Covid-19. So if there was to be some man made gain of function included in the virus, this is where one might expect to find it.

The Amino Acid sequence of the Furin Cleavage Site is PRRA (Proline Argenine Argenine Alanine). Each Amino Acid is coded for by a Codon, consisting of 3 nucleotides (genetic sequence letters). So all the differences in the genetic code between Covid-19 and RaTG13 are at most one Codon long, one amino acid long, other than the Furin Cleavage Sequence, which is…

CCT CGG CGG GCA

The complimentary sequence (the opposing DNA strand of the double helix is (GGAGCCGCCCGT) because C binds with G and A binds with T

The reverse compliment (the same thing written backwards) is therefore TGCCCGCCGAGG

The researchers did a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) alignment search (which means they search for the gene sequence, the reverse gene sequence, the complimentary gene sequence and the reverse complimentary gene sequence) through every gene sequence in nature known to man for CTCCTCGGCGGGCACGTAG which is the 19 nucleotide sequence containing the Furin Cleavage Sequence, which also appears in Covid-19, and which is found actually in the reverse compliment form CTACGTGCCCGCCGAGGAG patented by Moderna.

Their search results can be found here.

So Moderna first applied for a patent for the 19 nucleotide sequence in 2013 on December 16. Perhaps December25 would have been more appropriate since it was destined to become the Crown of Thorns of Mathew27, Mark15 and John19

Table2: Shows that the sequence occurs in Covid-19 from nucleotide 23601 to 23619.

Table3: Shows that this gene sequence does not exist in nature (but 14 nucleotide parts of it do). 

I decided to check their work. Yes. I fact checked them (I will send an invoice to the globalists). This turned out to be a bit of an epic journey. The Google patent page for US9587003B2 does not contain the gene sequence. The pdf of the patent does not contain the gene sequence and is not searchable from pages 101-304. But it does have a link to a lengthy ‘Sequence Listing” section which link one cannot copy. So I manually transcribed it in my fair hand –  http://seqdata.uspto.gov/?pageRequest=docDetail&DocID=US09587003B2 

From that page you can enter the Sequence ID quoted in the paper as 11652 and get to https://seqdata.uspto.gov/?pageRequest=viewSequence&DocID=US09587003B2&seqID=11652 which has the following at Nucleotides 2751-2733 reading backwards…

gccctgatca ccatcatggc ccagatcggc agctacgtgc ccgccgagga ggccaccatc     2760
CTACGTGCCCGCCGAGGAG patented by Moderna is the reverse compliment of CTCCTCGGCGGGCACGTAG, the 19 nucleotide sequence which appears in Covid-19 DNA from nucleotide 23601-23619 (which would therefore be covered by their patent).

Likewise you can search for the sequence in US9149506B2 by going to https://seqdata.uspto.gov/?pageRequest=viewSequence&DocID=US09149506B2&seqID=11652, whereupon you will find the same thing again

gccctgatca ccatcatggc ccagatcggc agctacgtgc ccgccgagga ggccaccatc     2760
I then searched the gene sequence of Wuhan Hu1 (alpha) at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512 and found 

23581 ttatcagact cagactaatt ctcctcggcg ggcacgtagt gtagctagtc aatccatcat from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512 
Which has the 19 nucleotide sequence CTCCTCGGCGGGCACGTAG from 23601-23619 as described in table 3. 

I then ran my own non aligned blast search of all patented gene sequences for the reverse compliment directly (or perhaps for a back handed compliment) and got the same results as the researchers 



And the same for the other 3 US patents.

So I can confirm, and the reader can confirm using the links above, that Moderna did apply for a Patent not only on the reverse compliment of the 12 nucleotide Furin Cleavage Site in Covid-19 but actually on the 19 nucleotide sequence containing it as described above.

Furthermore they did not merely apply for a patent on 2016 February 4 with US9587003B2: as reported in the Daily Mail. They actually applied on 2013 December 16 for 4 patents with US9149506B2, US9216205B2, US9255129B2, US9301993B2:as well.

So Moderna had developed the 19 nucleotide gene sequence containing the Furin Cleavage Site which gives Covid19 its infectivity to humans by patented gain of function research as early as 2013, 6 years before the Wuhan outbreak took place. Not 3 as reported in the Mail and virally elsewhere.. 

So now we look at the chances of this occurring naturally. The paper calculates the probability of this particular 19 nucleotide sequence occurring randomly in a 30,000 nucleotide virus as

(30,000-18) x (1/4)19  = 1.09 x 10-7

Which is correct because there are 30,000-18 places to start the sequence given that it needs a further 18 more letters to complete it. But there are actually 29,904 nucleotides in Wuhan HU1 (alpha). So a more accurate calculation would be

(29,904-18) x (1/4)19  = 1.087 x 10-7

Then they calculate the chances that the 19 nucleotide sequence occurs in the patented library of 24,712 sequences with a mean length of 3300 nucleotides. But that calculation is irrelevant because the sequence did not randomly appear in 5 Moderna Patent applications. The sequence was known to code for a Furin Cleavage Site, which is known to provide gain of function to Coronaviruses.

It was put there deliberately and patented due to its infecting power in humans, which we shall see, later in the article, results from the normal viral Arginine (R) codon AGA (used in 45% of viral Arginine codons) being replaced by the human Arginine codon CGG (used in 0% of viral Arginine codons) in the furin cleavage site.

All we are tying to work out here is what the chances are of a 19 nucleotide sequence patented by Moderna turning up in Covid-19 through natural causes, the natural mutations of Bat Coronavirus RaTG13 or some other virus.

The nucleotides form Codons which are triplets. So there are 64 possible triplets of the 4 DNA nucleotides ACGT (4x4x4 = 64). But all triplets do occur. 61 code for 20 amino acids redundantly and 3 are stop codons which tell the ribosome to stop making the protein.

But things are not this simple because the Furin cleavage site appears in the spike protein where it needs to be and the spike protein only has 1273×3 = 3819 nucleotides. The chances of the 19 nucleotide Furin Cleavage sequence appearing in the spike protein are 

(3,819-18) x (1/4)19  = 1.389 x 10-8

Or 1 in 72 million. So those would be the chances that one particular variant, say the first Covid-19 variant, had the 19 nucleotide sequence in the right place (the spike). And it did. So certainly by the balance of probabilities, and certainly beyond a reasonable doubt (1 in 72 million being an unreasonable doubt) Moderna made Covid-19. 

100% Biochemic Proof that Covid19 was Man Made
The Double CGG Codon used in the Moderna Specific Furin Cleavage site does not occur in any other Furin cleavage site in any other virus in nature. Furin cleavage sites do occur in other viruses but NOT at all in other betacoronaviruses like Covid-19 and NOT at all with the double CGG codon.

Arginine ( R), can be encoded by any of the 6 triplets: AGG, AGA, CGA, CGC, CGG, CGT. In Covid-19, the furin site (PRRA), has 12 nucleotides (3 x 4). In Covid-19, the RR doublet of the furin site is encoded by CGG-CGG.  

Two Biochemists Prof Antonio R. Romeu and Assistant Prof Enric Ollé analysed the RR doublet from a large sample of furin cleavage sites of several kinds of viruses. They found that there were no RR doublets encoded by the CGG-CGG codons in any virus in nature. They observed that the AGA triplet was the majority codon involved in these viral RR doublets.

In all genetic recombination (where a part of one genome merges with another genome), the donor code is passed to the acceptor. But there is simply NO KNOWN VIRUS with a Moderna Specific Furin Cleavage Site (having the CGG-CGG codon pair) that exists to donate a Moderna Specific furin cleavage site to Covid19. So the only way that sequence could get into Covid-19 is from Moderna. Moderna was the donor. Nature was not. QED. Case Closed..  

But it gets worse.

The Spanish Profs decided to analyse the arginine codon usage in every single protein in Covid-19. The found the following…
AGG (13%)
AGA (45%)
CGA (5%)
CGC (10%)
CGG (3%)
CGT (24%). 

So the AGA codon triplet was the majority, and interestingly, CGG was the minority codon for Arginine in the virus. 

But it gets worse still.

In the specific case of S protein, of the 42 Arginines (R) it has, 20 are encoded by AGA, and only 2 by CGG. These 2 of course, are the two in the Moderna Specific Furin Cleavage Site.

So the only Arginine in the spike protein that is encoded a la Moderna are in the Furin Cleavage site. The other 40 instances do not use CGG at all. 

They then go on to comment that each individual species in nature has its own codon preferences. Obviously viruses like AGA, and do not like CGG at all, in nature.

But guess which species does use CGG for Arginine more than the other 5 competing codons – yes its jolly old homo sapiens. Our coding preferences for Arginine are

AGG (20%)
AGA (20%)
CGA (11%)
CGC (19%)
CGG (21%)
CGT (9%).

So the CGG codon in the furin cleavage site WILL have come about through Chimeric (human animal combination) gain of function research. 

Could Somebody other than Moderna have made Covid-19 using the Moderna Specific Furin Cleavage Site?
“New documents show that just 18 months before the first Covid-19 cases appeared, researchers had submitted plans to release skin-penetrating nanoparticles and aerosols containing “novel chimeric spike proteins” of bat coronaviruses into cave bats in Yunnan, China. They also planned to create chimeric viruses, genetically enhanced to infect humans more easily, and requested $14million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) to fund the work.

Papers, confirmed as genuine by a former member of the Trump administration, show they were hoping to introduce “human-specific cleavage sites” to bat coronaviruses which would make it easier for the virus to enter human cells. 
When Covid-19 was first genetically sequenced, scientists were puzzled about how the virus had evolved such a human-specific adaptation at the cleavage site on the spike protein, which is the reason it is so infectious.” – the Telegraph

I can see all of the great journalists at the Daily Mail and the Telegraph (not to mention scientists around the world) doing all of this research into Covid19 and reaching the inevitable logical conclusion that there was either an accidental or a deliberate lab leak and then having to word their conclusions in such a way as to label that strong probablity as a weak possibility. 

But here above we have proved it as a fact (since the Moderna Specific Furin Cleavage Sequence CGG codon does not occur in any furin cleavage site in any natural virus and therefore it cannot have been the result of natural genetic recombination. So it has to be the result of man made genetic insertion. 

In theory a further party involved with the NAIAD or the NIH could have used the furin cleavage site patented by Moderna and made Covid19 themselves. This would not have broken any patent of Moderna. The Furin cleavage site itself is not patentable having been known since at least 2004

2007-05-29 Application granted

Although Moderna could actually have patented the Moderna Specific (CGG for AGA) encoding of the furin cleavage site which was is not known in nature even today (if we accept that Covid-19 is man made).

But given that the lab leak (deliberate or accidental) came from Wuhan, and given the Chinese cover up and given the Fauci denials exposed by Senator Rand Paul, and given the NIH, NIAID cover ups and the US Intelligence services cover up, when their 3 month long report into the origin of Covid-19 ordered by presidential impersonator Biden yielded nothing, and given the relationships between the NIAID, the NIH, the WIV, the EcoHealth Alliance, the University of North Carolina and Moderna, I cannot see any room for anyone else.

Furthermore the entire unholy cabal of bad actors started developing the Moderna Vaccine before the pandemic struck – https://www.infowars.com/posts/must-watch-nih-claimed-joint-ownership-of-moderna-mrna-vaccine-began-development-weeks-ahead-of-pandemic/ 

But things are not as simple as that because nature has had certainly 100,000 years to make human viruses and it never once put a Moderna specific (CGG for AGA) furin cleavage site into anything, nor did it put the 19 nucleotide sequence in anything before.

Yet within 6 years of Moderna patenting it, we find it in Covid-19 in circumstances where Moderna is working with that virus. So just there the probability is not 100,000 to 6 or 16,666 to 1 that Moderna is responsible rather than nature. No it is 100% because nature has not done it. It never has and there is no evidence that it ever will.

It is man the mixes up human and viral Arginine codons not nature. 

Pro Luc Montagnier spent the last years of his life proving that COVID-19 was man made and containing much of the HIV1 genetic code
Prof Luc Montagnier, before he died on 2022February8, did a total assassination of the concept that Covid-19 evolved naturally by showing that it had massive equivalence to HIV. The diagram below shows a 275 nucleotide region of Covid-19 which has 200 nucleotides from HIV/SIV (Simian ImmunoVirus) in it. And remember there are 61 codons specifying 20 amino acids. So one can say the same thing in on average 3 different ways with codons.

You can download a pdf of his study here and the supplementary materials here. It is very technical. But he did win the Nobel prize for discovering the HIV virus. So if anyone would know if Covid had been boosted with HIV, it would be him. He pointed out that Covid-19 was man made early in the pandemic and was himself assassinated by the press and the fact checkers as a result. Every single fact checker who attacked him was wrong.

There was no scientific basis to any of their fact checking. These outfits are not fact checkers at all of course. They are globalist disinformation agencies, sons of Goebbels, fact chuckers and science deniers. They are about as trustworthy as an American election. I can check a fact for myself thank you very much. I don’t need a brainwashed woke madrassa student telling me their opinion about a subject that they never studied at University.


Since we have proven beyond a reasonable doubt (beyond a 1 in 72 million doubt statically and with 100% certainly biochemically from the Moderna Specific Furin Cleavage Site) that Moderna made Covid-19. And since Moderna and Fauci have not admitted to having made it and have in fact covered up evidence to that effect, it may be the case that they are hiding something else as well.

Because the only two theories now left are the accidental lab leak theory and the deliberate lab leak theory. I mean the vast majority of political leaks are not accidents. They are deliberate strategies to provide advantage to the leaker or his paymaster. It is well known in the IT industry that viruses appear when antivirus sales are needed. Why would things be any different with human viruses, now that they can be man made too? Especially when you consider the massive role of Bill Gates and his foundation and GAVI and GVAP in he global vaccination business.

The only reason that Moderna would make Covid-19 is to release it. Otherwise the entire exercise would be financially futile, commercially pointless

The reason adduced by Fauci for doing gain of function research is that man needs to be ahead of nature or bad actors in order to have a vaccine in good time if a disease mutates or is genetically modified by the Chinese or the Russians to be lethal.

But in order to believe that one has to believe that Moderna are interested in the saving people’s lives. I am sorry. All their actions show to me that they are interested in vaccinating people knowing how likely that is to cost them their lives.

They are interested in profit, the profit that comes from a pandemic. They are not saviours of mankind as they represent. They are our exploiters and our abusers.

They produced the virus in order to leak it, in order to pose as our saviours from their own leak. These are not the activities of a saviour figure. Luc Montagnier was trying to be our saviour from them and he was assassinated (professionally) by their groupies. Moderna were doing gain of function research in order to release the virus and force a vaccine for it in a manner which would maximise their profits. That is not a conspiracy theory. It is what happened precisely. Their share price went up by 20x. 

They released it in order to sell their vaccines and to destroy the immune systems of their customers because our immune systems reduce their profits. That is Big Pharma business. 

The reason that the writer is so confident that Moderna or their agents made and leaked Covid-19 and the reason I called it as such at the start of the pandemic to almost as much ridicule as Prof Montagnier received (God bless him) is that the scriptures say in Matthew27, Mark15 and John19 that.  

29 And they (the soldiers of the governor of verse 27) platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
30 And they spat upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head. (Matthew 27 ASV)

May I therefore beg your indulgence whilst I interpret these words: 

The US department of defence funded the gene splicing of the Coronavirus of Spike Proteins (Covid-19) through NIH and NIAID and DARPA which first infected Jesus, through his fiance, the New Covenant Saints, just after he became the secular King, Caesar to those saints, the antitypical Jews, those covenanted to be angelic sons of Jacob, the born agains angelically.

We calculated that the malediction which prevented Jesus becoming Caesar to the saints ended in 2019Tishri15 (October17/18). Glenn Beck did a documentary showing that 10 hospitals in Wuhan took cases with Covid19 symptoms in October 2019. Yes Folks. Covid-19 is a proof that Jesus is now secular King over the saints, the antitypical Jews, the Jews by angelic salvation covenant, at the least.

But then the soldiers spat upon him. For that is how Covid19 is transferred, through small aerosol droplets exhaled out of the mouth. The soldiers deliberately spat upon him. It was not a SALIVA LEAK! They smote Jesus on the head because the saints are the head of the church and they caught Covid19 not by random chance infection but by a deliberate smiting with a read, a biological weapon, a deliberate weaponised attack. For more on this see here.

So what Prof Montagnier saw with his virology expertise, I saw with my theological expertise. Showing that whilst fact checkers and science are mutually exclusive, science and theology actually agree, when properly understood (and that is one big caveat). Prof M taught us that the vaccines cause the variants. Indeed basic virology forbids mass vaccination during a pandemic for that very reason. He said the the curve of deaths follows the curve of vaccinations. Mind you, paradoxically, if the vaccines caused Omicron, then they saved us from themselves!

The Time has Come to hold People and Organisations to Account
The Covid19 makers, the genetic vaccine makers. their funders and their promoters, which include almost every government and public sector and health service in the world, are therefore guilty of Genocide and crimes against humanity. They have pushed genetic rape and sickness and death onto half of the population of the world in order to enrich the pockets of Pharmaceutical Companies. Governments and Public sectors around the world have abandoned their health service regulation to billionaires and heartless corporations

In the UK, all of the income tax we pay goes to the health service and all of its protocols are determined by its regulators and all of its regulators are controlled and funded by Big Pharma who seek to damage then manage our health for their profit.

So every penny we spend in income tax brings us one step closer to sickness, to death and to drug dependency.

So why did Prof Montagnier choose to spend the last years of his life proving that Covid-19 was man made and that the spike proteins, and therefore the vaccines, were an existential threat to the species? What did he have left to prove to himself or to anybody else at 87-89? He certainly did not do it to increase his reputation in the profession.

No, he was driven by the same passion that drove him to discover HIV. A passion to SAVE mankind from viruses and those who would engineer them to damage us. And why did he give up the ghost in February 2022? Because he knew that Omicron had the vaccines beat. His job was done by a greater virologist even than him. He could therefore rest in peace and go see some people who understood the magnitude of his contribution.

Covid-19 was not made in 2019. It was made from the 19 nucleotide Moderna specific chimeric (CGG for AGA) furin cleavage site which does not occur anywhere in nature.
And every Covid death and every Covid vaccine death is parked squarely on the doorstep of ModeRNA waiting for justice.

But we shall not execute that justice fast enough. And therefore the final plague upon mankind of Revelation 6:8, delivered by the 4th horseman of the apocalypse, which plague Bill Gates himself has prophesied, will arrive later this year (after War and after Famine, the 2nd and 3rd horsemen)."

Why was there absolutely zero reaction from the news anchor? How did she get in there with a huge poster? Why is her body language so nonchalant, almost playful?
The answer - it was all staged. It’s now come out that the whole thing was fake. That “brave Russian woman’s” social media, before she conveniently set her accounts to private, was full of support for Putin, the Russian forces invading and committing genocide in Ukraine, and the “Z” symbol (essentially the 21st century equivalent of the swastika). But why? What would be the point? Why would Russia put anti-Russian rhetoric on air?
The answer - distraction. And it worked. It 💯 percent worked. Look at what the world is talking about today. The “brave Russian woman” and the “good Russians”. Thousands of people are now engaged in arguing the merits of the Russian population and defending the “good Russians” when they could be instead directing that time and energy in speaking for the Ukrainian people who continue to be slaughtered day in and day out.

Politifact_FALSE_Press release_691928,"Richmond, VA – As the special session begins today, it is clear that Governor Youngkin’s incompetence continues to harm Virginians, with most glaring example being his failure to secure an agreement on the budget despite holding the majority in the House. Now, through his failed leadership, crucial funds localities rely on to function are at risk. This comes after Governor Youngkin called legislators back to Richmond through a privately funded campaign ad – taking some members of his own party by surprise – while still refusing to agree to key funding issues for our public schools and health care infrastructure in our communities. 

Senate Democrats this session proposed a comprehensive budget that will invest in Virginia’s public schools, support hard-working teachers and prepare students for good-paying jobs of the future in the energy, health, and education sectors. They will continue to push for smart tax cuts for everyday Virginians in addition to essential community investments. The future of the Commonwealth’s economy depends on strong health, wellness and education infrastructure, as well as access to opportunity for each and every resident.

This session, Republicans launched attack after attack on Virginia’s public schools, teachers and students. They have repeatedly threatened to defund public education and their budget is proof of their true intentions. The proposed House budget cuts hundreds of millions in funding for public education, including gutting teacher pay raises by 20% and slashing tens of millions in funding for early childhood education.

The budget proposed by House Republicans also includes millions of cuts to successful and proven programs like the Virginia Mental Health Access Project, which provides critical care to young people and slashed more than $10 million in funding for permanent supportive housing, a program that provides housing and wraparound services, allowing individuals experiencing mental illness to live in community-based settings.

““It is embarrassing and unprecedented for a Governor who has the majority in the House to still not have an agreement on the budget after calling legislators back to Richmond  – a move that cost taxpayers $40,000,” said DPVA Chairwoman Susan Swecker. “Governor Youngkin’s failure to pass a budget and support important investments in our childrens’ futures and our health care infrastructure is now hurting local governments and Virginians. His incompetent leadership is a danger to our Commonwealth and I am thankful that Virginia Democrats are fighting for generational investments in our futures and ensuring the longevity of our Commonwealth.”"

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_259129,"The world first started to hear about a novel coronavirus in early January 2020, with reports of an alleged new pneumonia like illness spreading across Wuhan, China. However, the world did not actually know of Covid-19 until February 2020, because it was not until the 11th of that month that the World Health Organisation officially named the novel coronavirus disease as Covid-19.

So with this being the official truth, why does United States Government data show that the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) awarded a contract on the 12th November 2019 to Labyrinth Global Health INC. for ‘COVID-19 Research’, at least one month before the alleged emergence of the novel coronavirus, and three months before it was officially dubbed Covid-19?

The shocking findings however, do not end there. The contract awarded in November 2019 for ‘COVID-19 Research’ was not only instructed to take place in Ukraine, it was in fact part of a much larger contract for a ‘Biological threat reduction program in Ukraine’.

Perhaps explaining why Labyrinth Global Health has been collaborating with Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance, and Ernest Wolfe’s Metabiota since its formation in 2017.

The Government of the United States has a website called ‘USA Spending‘, an official open data source of federal spending information. According to the site as of 12th April 2021 the US Government has spent a mind-blowing $3.63 trillion “in response to COVID-19”. But that’s not the only information on Covid that can be found within the site.

Hidden within the ‘Award Search’ are details on a contract awarded by the Department of Defense to a company named ‘Black & Veatch Special Projects Corp‘, which is allegedly “a global engineering, procurement, consulting and construction company specialising in infrastructure development”.

The contact was awarded on September 20th, 2012 and is described as “Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services”. Obviously this is very vague and most likely of little interest to anyone who happens to stumble across it. But there is something contained deep within the details that should be of interest to anyone and everyone.

The ‘Award History’ for the contract contains a tab for ‘Sub-Awards’ detailing the recipients, action date, amount, and very brief description for 115 Sub-Award transactions. Most of the Sub-Awards are extremely mundane for things such as “laboratory equipment for Kyiv”, or “office furniture for Kyiv”.

But there is one Sub-Award that stands out among the rest, and it is was awarded to Labyrinth Global Health INC for “SME Manuscript Documentation and COVID-19 Research”.

An award for Covid-19 research isn’t exactly shocking when the world is allegedly in the grip of a Covid-19 pandemic, but considering the fact the sub-contract was awarded 12th November 2019, at least one month before the alleged emergence of the novel coronavirus, and three months before it was officially dubbed Covid-19, the award for Covid-19 research should come as a shock to everyone.

But the shock doesn’t end there, because the place the contact for Covid-19 research was instructed to take place was Ukraine, as was the entire contract awarded by the DOD to Black & Veatch Special Projects Corp.

The contract details found on the ‘USA Spending’ site actually reveal that the specific DOD department that awarded the contact was the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). The contract was awarded 20th September 2012, and concluded on 13th October 2020.

Whilst the details are vague, the US Government site also reveals that $21.7 million of the $116.6 million contact was spent on a ‘Biological threat reduction program in Ukraine’.

Why did the Department of Defense pay a company that is allegedly “a global engineering, procurement, consulting and construction company specialising in infrastructure development”, to help implement a “Biological threat reduction program in Ukraine’?

And why did both the DOD and said company then pay Labyrinth Global Health INC to carry out COVID-19 research in Ukraine at least one month before the alleged emergence of the novel coronavirus, and three months before it was officially dubbed Covid-19?

Founded in 2017, Labyrinth Global Health is allegedly a “women-owned small business with deep expertise and a proven track record supporting initiatives for scientific and medical advancement.”

They describe themselves as “a multicultural and international organization with offices in four countries and a team of experts with diverse backgrounds and competencies, including microbiology, virology, global health, emerging infectious disease nursing, medical anthropology, field epidemiology, clinical research, and health information systems.”

One of those offices just happens to be located in Kyiv, Ukraine, which the company dubs “a gateway to Eastern Europe”.

The leadership team of Labyrinth Global consists of Karen Saylors, PHD who is the Chief Executive Officer; Mary Guttieri, PHS who is the Chief Science Officer; and Murat Tartan who is the Chief Financial Officer.

Karen Saylors, PhD, who co-founded Labyrinth Global Health, has allegedly worked in the international public health field for over a decade and has spent many years living in Africa establishing global surveillance networks, “working with partners to improve Global Health policy on infectious disease detection, response, and control”.

At Labyrinth, Dr. Saylors specialises in studies that aim to understand and mitigate biological and behavioural risk of disease transmission. Dr. Saylors worked with Oxford University Clinical Trials Network in Vietnam on zoonotic disease surveillance research and continues to coordinate with regional partners on emerging outbreaks in animal and human populations.

But who are the partners that Dr Karen Saylors and Labyrinth Global Health choose to work with? They are none other than the ‘Eco Health Alliance’ and ‘Metabiota’.

Dr Karen Saylors, Eco Health Alliance and Metabiota worked together on the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) ‘PREDICT’ program from 2009, while Labyrinth Global Health worked alongside EHA and Metabiota on the PREDICT program from 2017.

Launched in 2009 and funded by USAID, PREDICT was an early warning system for new and emerging diseases in 21 countries. It was led by the University of California’s (“UC”) Davis One Health Institute and core partners included EcoHealth Alliance (“EHA”), Metabiota, Wildlife Conservation Society, and Smithsonian Institution, and as we’ve just revealed; Labyrinth Global Health. PREDICT was a forerunner of the more ambitious Global Virome Project.

The USAID describes PREDICT as having made “significant contributions to strengthening global surveillance and laboratory diagnostic capabilities for both known and newly discovered viruses within several important virus groups, such as filoviruses (including ebolaviruses), influenza viruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses“.

Here’s one of the many studies published by Eco Health Alliance, Metabiota and Labyrinth Global Health proving the connection –

PREDICT partnered with the non-profit Eco Health Alliance (EHA) to carry out its 9-year effort to catalogue hundreds of thousands of biological samples, “including over 10,000 bats.” A PREDICT-funded 2015 study on “diversity of coronavirus in bats” also included Peter Daszak, president of EHA, among its participants.

Eco Health Alliance is listed as a partner of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (“WIV”) on archived pages of its website and was mentioned as a one of the institute’s “strategic partners” by the WIV’s Deputy Director General in 2018.

Notably, the relationship between the WIV and the American Biodefence establishment was advanced by EHA policy advisor, David R. Franz, former commander at US bioweapons lab at Fort Detrick.

WIV’s Dr. Shi Zhengli, a.k.a. “Batwoman,” had also worked with EHA’s Daszak on bat-related studies. As far back as 2005, Daszak and Zhengli were conducting research on SARS-like coronaviruses in bats. Several PREDICT-funded studies on SARS-like coronaviruses and Swine Flu count with both Zhengli’s and Daszak’s contributions. Perhaps the most noteworthy of these is a 2015 PREDICT and NIH-funded study she co-authored entitled: ‘A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence’.

Meanwhile, Nathan Wolfe is the founder of Metabiota and non-profit Global Viral. He spent over eight years conducting biomedical research in both sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Unsurprisingly, Wolfe is a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader.  More notably, since 2008 he had been a member of DARPA’s DSRC, Defence Science Research Council, until it was disbanded.

All of these people and organisations have been working for at least the last decade studying coronaviruses and helping to set up Biolabs in Ukraine. All using US Department of Defense funds to do so. You can read much more about this here, here and here.

Putting the biolabs in Ukraine to one side for now, let’s return to the subject of Covid-19. If the US Government was funding Covid-19 research before Covid-19 was publicly known to exist then this suggests they either knew Covid-19 existed naturally, or they were involved in constructing this virus in a lab.

But if the contract evidence isn’t enough for you to come to this conclusion (it should be), then perhaps coupling it with evidence that the US National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases’ (NIAID), and Moderna had a coronavirus candidate in December 2019 will be.

A confidentially agreement which can be viewed here, states that providers ‘Moderna’ alongside the ‘National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ (NIAID) agreed to tranfer ‘mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates’ developed and jointly-owned by NIAID and Moderna to recipients ‘The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’ on the 12th December 2019.

The material transfer agreement was signed the December 12th 2019 by Ralph Baric, PhD, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and then signed by Jacqueline Quay, Director of Licensing and Innovation Support at the University of North Carolina on December 16th 2019.

The agreement was also signed by two representatives of the NIAID, one of whom was Amy F. Petrik PhD, a technology transfer specialist who signed the agreement on December 12th 2019 at 8:05 am. The other signatory was Barney Graham MD PhD, an investigator for the NIAID, however this signature was not dated.

The final signatories on the agreement were Sunny Himansu, Moderna’s Investigator, and Shaun Ryan, Moderna’s Deputy General Councel. Both signautres were made on December 17th 2019.

All of these signatures were made prior to any knowledge of the alleged emergence of the novel coronavirus.It wasn’t until December 31st 2019 that the World Health Organisation (WHO) became aware of an alleged cluster of viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. But even at this point they had not determined that an alleged new coronavirus was to blame, instead stating the pneumonia was of “unknown cause”.

All of this requires much further research to fit all of the pieces of the puzzle together, but here’s what we definitely know so far –

A novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan in December 2019.
The world did not get to hear about this novel coronavirus until early January 2020.
The world did not know this novel coronavirus was called Covid-19 until February 2020, when the World Health Organization officially named it so.
The US Department of Defense awarded a contract for Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services to Black & Veatch Special Projects Corp‘, which is allegedly “a global engineering, procurement, consulting and construction company specialising in infrastructure development”.
That contract involved a Biological threat reduction program in Ukraine.
As part of this larger contract, another contract was awarded to Labyrinth Global Health for ‘COVID-19 Research’ on 12th November 2019.
This was awarded at least one month before the alleged emergence of the novel coronavirus, and three months before it was officially dubbed Covid-19.
Labyrinth Global Health works alongside the ‘Eco Health Alliance’, and ‘Metabiota’, and participated in the USAID PREDICT program. All of these people and organisations have been working for at least the past decade studying coronaviruses and helping to set up Biolabs in Ukraine. All using US Department of Defense funds to do so.
Information found here points to Eco Health Alliance having a hand in creating the Covid-19 virus.
Information found here points to Moderna having a hand in creating the Covid-19 virus.
‘Moderna’, alongside the ‘National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ (NIAID) agreed to tranfer ‘mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates’ developed and jointly-owned by NIAID and Moderna, to recipients ‘The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’ on the 12th December 2019.
What does all this point to? That’s for you to ponder and decide. But we promise you there is much more to come on the above…"

•Phthalates- are meant to keep products soft and flexible. That’s great, but phthalates may also carry health risks. There have been many reports of phthalates being linked to various cancers, including breast, liver, kidney and lung. 
•Parabens- link to breast cancer, as well their negative impact on the body’s endocrine system. Parabens are also a common catalyst for skin allergies. 
•Formaldehyde- this chemical has been linked to cancer as well as other nervous system issues, like chest pain, coughing, trouble breathing, and respiratory irritations.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_942653,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden repeatedly told teachers gathered at the White House that school children are “like yours when they’re in the classroom.”

The president spoke at a Teacher of the Year event held Wednesday where he urged teachers to help students “gain confidence enough to know what they can do.”

“They’re not someone else’s children, they’re our children,” he said. “And they are the kite strings that literally lift our national ambitions aloft. … Think about it. If you got to do one thing to make sure the nation succeeded in the next two generations, what would you do? I would say, literally, have the best-educated public in the world.”

Biden emphasized that “we have an obligation to help them … reach their potential.”

“You have heard me say it many times about our children, but it is true, they’re all our children. And the reason you are the teachers of the year is because you recognize that,” he said. “They’re not somebody else’s children. They’re like yours when they’re in the classroom.”

The president’s remarks come after uproar over gender identity and Critical Race Theory concepts being taught to children in both public and private schools. Largely exposed by virtual schooling during the pandemic, these concepts have prompted a parental rebellion against school boards across the nation.

Former Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe sparked massive backlash when he said on the campaign trail that he didn’t think “parents should be telling schools what they should teach” — a remark that some have argued cost him the election.

“No, Joe, they are not ‘somebody else’s children,’” the American Principles Project fired back at the president in a Wednesday evening tweet. “They are OUR children.”

Biden also honored teacher Kurt Russell, who works at Ohio’s Oberlin High School and was named the teacher of the year by the nonprofit Council of Chief State School Officers, according to CNN.

The publication reported that Russell teaches African American history, race, gender, and oppression courses, coaches varsity basketball, and serves as the faculty adviser for the school’s Black Student Union.

“Teaching is one of the hardest jobs in this country,” Biden said. “Today, there are too many politicians trying to score political points trying to ban books — even math books. I mean, did you ever think … that when you’d be teaching you’d be worrying about book burnings and banning books? All because it doesn’t fit somebody’s political agenda.”

“American teachers have dedicated their lives to teaching our children and lifting them up,” he continued. “We ought to stop making them a target of the culture wars. That’s where this is going.”"

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_486671,"“Countries with high levels of mask compliance did not perform better than those with low mask usage,” found a new study, whose data and analysis instead discovered a “moderate positive correlation between mask usage and deaths.”


The peer-reviewed study – “Correlation Between Mask Compliance and COVID-19 Outcomes in Europe” – was authored by Beny Spira, an Associate Professor at the University of São Paulo whose research focuses on the molecular genetics of microorganisms.

Published in the Cureus Journal of Medical Science on April 19th, 2022, the paper describes its purpose as “analyz[ing] the correlation between mask usage against morbidity and mortality rates in the 2020-2021 winter in Europe.

“Data from 35 European countries on morbidity, mortality, and mask usage during a six-month period were analyzed and crossed,” continued the study, which encompassed a total of 602 million people.

“The findings presented in this short communication suggest that countries with high levels of mask compliance did not perform better than those with low mask usage in the six-month period that encompassed the second European wave of COVID-19,” Spira summarized.

“The lack of negative correlations between mask usage and COVID-19 cases and deaths suggest that the widespread use of masks at a time when an effective intervention was most needed, i.e., during the strong 2020-2021 autumn-winter peak, was not able to reduce COVID-19 transmission.”

Beyond finding no benefit to mask mandate compliance in curtailing the spread of COVID-19, the paper found a “moderate positive correlation” between the use of masks and COVID-19 deaths.

“Moreover, the moderate positive correlation between mask usage and deaths in Western Europe also suggests that the universal use of masks may have had harmful unintended consequences,” it asserted based on the following figures:

MUST READ:  Politif*cked: An Office Manager from Florida and a Gates-Funded Professor Are Censoring Studies Linking Mask Usage to Increased Deaths.
“The positive correlation between mask usage and cases was not statistically significant (rho = 0.136, p = 0.436), while the correlation between mask usage and deaths was positive and significant (rho = 0.351, p = 0.039). The Spearman’s correlation between masks and deaths was considerably higher in the West than in East European countries: 0.627 (p = 0.007) and 0.164 (p = 0.514), respectively.”

Spira also explains how confounding factors that could have potentially influenced the study – vaccination rates or prior levels of COVID-19 – were irrelevant:

Concerning disparate vaccination rates between countries, he explained “this is unlikely given the fact that at the end of the period analysed in this study (31th March 2021), vaccination rollout was still at its beginning, with only three countries displaying vaccination rates higher than 20%: the UK (48%), Serbia (35%), and Hungary (30%), with all doses counted individually.”

“It could also be claimed that the rise in infection levels prompted mask usage resulting in higher levels of masking in countries with already higher transmission rates. While this assertion is certainly true for some countries, several others with high infection rates, such as France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain had strict mask mandates in place since the first semester of 2020. In addition, during the six-month period covered by this study, all countries underwent a peak in COVID-19 infections (Figures 1, 2), thus all of them endured similar pressures that might have potentially influenced the level of mask usage,” he added.

The study comes amidst the White House pledging to fight to reinstate to the recently overturned federal mask mandate for travelers. It also comes amidst separate studies showing how mask mandates in the U.S. resulted in higher COVID-19 fatality rates."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_42913,"Laurie Fiorenza, director of student learning | oprfhs.org

Oak Park and River Forest High School administrators will require teachers next school year to adjust their classroom grading scales to account for the skin color or ethnicity of its students.

School board members discussed the plan called “Transformative Education Professional Development & Grading” at a meeting on May 26, presented by Assistant Superintendent for Student Learning Laurie Fiorenza.

In an effort to equalize test scores among racial groups, OPRF will order its teachers to exclude from their grading assessments variables it says disproportionally hurt the grades of black students. They can no longer be docked for missing class, misbehaving in school or failing to turn in their assignments, according to the plan.

“Traditional grading practices perpetuate inequities and intensify the opportunity gap,” reads a slide in the PowerPoint deck outlining its rationale and goals.

It calls for what OPRF leaders describe as “competency-based grading, eliminating zeros from the grade book…encouraging and rewarding growth over time.”

Teachers are being instructed how to measure student  “growth” while keeping the school leaders' political ideology in mind.

“Teachers and administrators at OPRFHS will continue the process necessary to make grading improvements that reflect our core beliefs,” the plan states, promising to “consistently integrate equitable assessment and grading practices into all academic and elective courses” by fall 2023.

According to the Illinois State Board of Education, 38 percent of OPRF sophomore students taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) failed.

The OPRF failure rate was 77 percent for black students, 49 percent for Hispanics, 27 percent for Asians and 25 percent for whites.

""Signal and reinforce districts’ DEIJ values”

Advocates for so-called ""equity based"" grading practices, which seek to raise the grade point averages of black students and lower scores of higher-achieving Asian, white and Hispanic ones, say new grading criteria are necessary to further school districts' mission of DEIJ, or ""Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice.""

""By training teachers to remove the non-academic factors from their grading practices and recognize when personal biases manifest, districts can proactively signal a clear commitment toward DEIJ,"" said Margaret Sullivan, associate director at the Education Advisory Board, which sells consulting services to colleges and universities. 

Sullivan calls grading based on traditional classroom testing and homework performance “outdated practices” and foster ""unconscious biases.""

""Teachers may unintentionally let non-academic factors—like student behavior or whether a student showed up to virtual class—interfere with their final evaluation of students.,"" she said. “Traditional student grades include non-academic criteria that do not reflect student learning gains—including participation and on-time homework submission.""

School districts across the U.S. are ""experimenting with getting rid of zero-to-100 point scales and other strategies to keep missed assignments from dramatically bringing down overall grades,"" according to a March Associated Press report. ""Others are allowing students to retake tests and turn work in late. Also coming under scrutiny are extra-credit assignments than can favor students with more advantages.""

The report interviewed science teacher Brad Beadell of Santa Clara, Calif., who said he has ""stopped giving zeros and deducting points for late work"" as well as allowing students ""unlimited retakes for quizzes and tests.""

Fiorenza called for a switch to race-based grading last August, after issuing a report chronicling a spike in ""F"" grades by OPRF students in the 2020-21 school year.

""OPRF’s administration will adopt language that makes and keeps the system visible and continues to name racism as a complex interconnected structure,"" she wrote. ""We must recognize the unique challenges faced during the pandemic intensify the need for a systemic approach to confronting the racial and socioeconomic discrepancies often experienced by our underrepresented student population.""

Last year, West Cook News reported on an adjusted grade point average scale implemented by OPRF teacher Fiona Hill. It lowered the score for an ""F"" to 19 percent."

However, one must dig through the rest of the large document to learn that 22* of the 50* women suffered “Abortion Spontaneous,” “Abortion Spontaneous Complete,” “Abortion Spontaneous Incomplete,” or “Miscarriage.” [pp. 219, 561, 708, 1071, 1146, 1179, 1349, 1749, 1758, 1806, 1809, 3519, 3526, 3560, 3536, 3537, 3538, 3536, 3547, and 3551.] The adverse events report cut-off date was March 13, 2021, and the FDA received the report from Pfizer on April 1, 2021. Thus, the FDA was aware of the horrifying rate of fetal death by the start of April 2021.
 
The women listed in Listing of Subjects Reporting Pregnancy After Dose 1 received between one and four injections each. 42 of the women received the trial drug right away. Eight received the placebo and were then unblinded and given the vaccine. So, by March 31, 2021, all the pregnant women in the trial had received Pfizer’s BNT162b2 version of the vaccine.
 
Pfizer notes the miscarriages as serious adverse events (SAEs) with ‘moderate’ (2) or ‘severe’ (3) toxicity ratings. However, all the miscarriages were reported as being unrelated to the trial vaccine – i.e., having ‘Other’ causes – and marked as ‘Recovered/resolved’ adverse effects. To reiterate, not only does Pfizer deny any vaccine-related causality and assert the losses of life had other causes, but it also categorizes losing a baby as a ‘resolved adverse effect’ – like a headache that went away.
 
Here are some questions the public should be asking:
 
How did Pfizer determine their experimental vaccine product did not cause the miscarriages?
What ‘Other’ causes did Pfizer identify, and how did it identify them?
Did the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) simply accept the miscarriages as unrelated to the product, or did they demand information on those ‘Other’ causes?
And, crucially, what happened to the pregnancies which were ongoing at the report cut-off date of March 13, 2021? Were healthy babies born? Were damaged babies born? Were there more miscarriages?
 
The FDA had access to this data by April 1, 2021. The agency knew that a significant percentage of pregnancies ended in ‘Abortion Spontaneous,’ yet it seems to have failed in its duty to study the data and investigate what basis Pfizer had for marking the fetal deaths as unrelated to the vaccine and having ‘Other’ causes. And, certainly, the FDA failed to inform the public of this very serious adverse event. Without that information, women were not able to give informed consent for receiving Pfizer’s mRNA COVID vaccine.

**[Correction: Two analysts have reviewed this Pfizer document and reached different totals and percentages than did the author of this report. The Naked Emperor finds, “If we remove all the withdrawn participants and pregnancies connected with participants’ partners (instead of the participants themselves) we are left with 66 pregnancies and 12 miscarriages/abortions, giving a total of 18%.” Phil Kerpen finds, “So really all we can say is that at the timepoint when the file was generated there had been 11 miscarriages after Pfizer vaccine.” Please reference Pfizer document: 125742_S1_M5_5351_c4591001-interim-mth6-adverse-events.zip (pdf).]"

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_306732,"(Natural News) The Danish Health Authority has announced that just about every young and middle-aged person in Denmark is now prohibited from getting “vaccinated” for covid.
If you are under the age of 50, the Danish government says, then you are not allowed to take the shots. Previously, the Danish government prohibited the drug injections for everyone under the age of 18. (Related: Last fall, Denmark joined Sweden in banning Moderna’s covid injection after it was determined to cause myocarditis in young people.)
The only people under 50 who can receive the shots are those who are deemed to have a “higher risk of becoming severely [emphasis added] [ill] from Covid-19,” the government of Denmark said.
How this will be determined has yet to be fleshed out, but what we know is that the vast majority of Denmark is not only no longer at risk of being forced to get jabbed, but is actually prohibited from ever doing so again.
This is the kind of just say no to drugs campaign that we wish would launch in the United States and elsewhere, but pigs will fly before that ever happens.
Implicit in the Danish announcement is the idea that messenger RNA (messenger RNA) injections specifically come with far greater risks than any purported benefits. The same is true for the non-mRNA covid jabs still being pushed as well.
Denmark expecting another “large wave” of covid over winter, but since the jabs don’t help there is no reason to allow them

To be clear, the Danish Health Authority is not necessarily saying that covid has ended. To the contrary, the government there says it expects “a large wave of [covid] infection” in the coming months.

At the same time, government officials in Denmark are admitting that the jabs have not helped, and will never help, thus the new ban.
“The purpose of vaccination is not to prevent infection with covid-19, and people aged under 50 are therefore currently not being offered booster vaccination,” the Danish Health Authority announcement reads.
The announcement goes on to explain that younger people have an almost zero risk of becoming seriously ill from Chinese Germs, and many of them are already protected anyway – some of them because they “have previously been infected with covid-19.”
In other words, the Danish Health Authority is acknowledging two important things that American health officials deny:
1) Covid injections do not prevent infection – and by the looks of it, they actually cause more infection while increasing the risk of death
2) Natural immunity is real, and those who have previously tested “positive” for the Fauci Flu are now protected against it.
If only we could get these same types of acknowledgements in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and many other places that are ruled with an iron fist by globalists with a penchant for unrelenting medical fascism and abuse of citizens.
“The Danish move is particularly significant because Denmark has an excellent national health care system and has aggressively collected data on Covid and vaccines,” wrote Alex Berenson on his Substack about the situation.
“Denmark was among the first countries to stop giving Covid shots to healthy children and teenagers. Now other European countries are beginning to follow, with Britain ending mRNA shots for almost all children 10 and under.”
Big Tech, meanwhile, is already trying to spin the announcement out of Denmark to imply that it has nothing to do with actually stopping the injection of people for the Wuhan Flu.
“Good luck with that,” Berenson joked about the failing agenda of the tech giants.

According to the Mayo Clinic, atrial fibrillation “is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots in the heart.”

Covid-19 injections have caused millions of adverse reactions in the United States alone. Despite this, organizations like the NFL continue to push their players, coaches, and staff to get fully vaccinated and boosted, not because the vaccines have demonstrated efficacy but because that’s what the powers-that-be expect from them.
Numerous athletes have become ill and even died due to increased physical activity that is inherent with their lifestyle combined with the adverse reactions from the Covid jabs. It’s speculated that the spike proteins cause blood clots and microclots that damage organs of the body, including and especially the heart.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_52675,"In a shocking admission, a Pfizer executive on Monday stated that the company did not know if the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine it developed with BioNTech would prevent viral transmission before bringing it to market last year.

Janine Small, the president of international development markets for Pfizer, testified before the European Parliament's COVID-19 committee Monday on behalf of Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla, who was summoned by the committee but pulled out of his appointment.

During questions, Dutch Member of Parliament Rob Roos, a conservative and opponent of Europe's COVID-19 passports, asked Small whether Pfizer could provide lawmakers with evidence it believed the vaccine would prevent coronavirus transmission before bringing it to market.

""Was the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?"" Roos asked. ""If not, please say it clearly. If yes, are you willing to share the data with this committee?”

In response, Small said Pfizer did not know that the vaccine would prevent transmission before bringing it to market. 

“Regarding the question around, did we know about stopping immunization before it entered the market? No,"" she admitted.

""These, um, you know, we had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market. And from that point of view, we had to do everything at risk,” Small said. 

Following guidance from public health authorities, many governments in Europe and around the world implemented policies requiring people to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination in order to fully participate in public life. These ""COVID passports"" were issued on the premise that the vaccinated were protected from illness so that they could socialize with other people without risk of spreading the disease.

Roos, who along with a handful of other members of European Parliament objected to vaccination requirements, said in a video Tuesday that the justification for COVID passports ""was always a lie.""

""If you don't get vaccinated, you're anti-social! This is what the Dutch prime minister and health minister told us. You don't get vaccinated just for yourself, but also for others — you do it for all of society. That's what they said,"" Roos recounted. ""Today, this turns out to be complete nonsense.""

Roos said Small's admission that the vaccine was not tested to prevent transmission ""removes the entire legal basis for the COVID passport. The COVID passport that led to massive institutional discrimination as people lost access to essential parts of society.""

""I find this to be shocking, even criminal,"" Roos added.

The mRNA vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech was granted emergency use authorization in the United States on Dec. 11, 2020, and later granted Food and Drug Administration approval on August 23, 2021. The vaccine is marketed as Comirnaty and is used for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 12 years of age and older, though it is authorized for emergency use in children as young as five.

In granting an emergency use authorization to Pfizer in late 2020, the FDA wrote that there was no evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person. 

Public health officials, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, maintain that COVID-19 vaccination significantly lowers the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death for those infected with COVID-19.

""Like all vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing infection. Some people who are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations will get COVID-19 breakthrough infection,"" the CDC says. ""However, staying up to date with your COVID-19 vaccinations means that you are less likely to have a breakthrough infection and, if you do get sick, you are less likely to get severely ill or die.""

Prior to the vaccine's approval, Pfizer claimed that studies showed its vaccine was as much as 91.3% effective against COVID-19 and 100% effective in preventing infections in at least one study.

Roos said that the Pfizer executive's admission that the vaccine was never tested for preventing transmission was ""scandalous.""

""Millions of people worldwide felt forced to get vaccinated because of the myth that 'you do it for others.' Now this turned out to be a cheap lie. This should be exposed."" 

Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment.
Over time, the vaccine has proved to have waning efficacy against mutating strains (Delta, Omicron, etc.) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Health officials have advocated for people to receive COVID-19 booster shots as breakthrough infections have become more common.

Still, officials have claimed, contrary to the evidence that COVID-19 vaccination will prevent infection. President Joe Biden in July 2021 stated, ""You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations."" About a year later, he tested positive for the virus despite being fully vaccinated and up to date with booster shots.

Outgoing White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's go-to health spokesman during the pandemic, has also given conflicting statements on the vaccine's effectiveness. In May 2021, Fauci told CBS News that vaccinated people were a ""dead end"" for the virus, saying the likelihood a vaccinated person could transmit COVID was ""very, very low.""

""When you get vaccinated, you not only protect your own health and that of the family, but also you contribute to the community health by preventing the spread of the virus throughout the community,” Fauci said.

However, in August 2021, during the Delta wave, Fauci told Katie Couric that vaccinated people could still transmit the virus. ""They’re either without symptoms or only mildly symptomatic,” he said. “So it’s less that it’s going to make the vaccinated person sick. It’s more that it’s going to allow the vaccinated person to transmit it to someone else who might get sick, like a vulnerable person in the family, an elderly individual, a child who’s unvaccinated.”

The point wasn't to prevent transmission, but rather reduce the severity of illness, Fauci explained at the time. ""The vaccine is doing exactly what we wanted it to do,” he said. “It’s preventing people from getting seriously ill — that’s the reason why you get vaccinated.”"
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_979579,"Vaccine whistleblower, Brandy Vaughan, was found dead last week, killed in her home.

Brandy Vaughan, 47, was initially a pharmaceutical employee who sold Vioxx, a painkiller medication sold by the company Merck. It eventually came to light that Vioxx was found to double the risk of stroke and heart attacks in people.

The company Merck, knowingly continued to distribute the painkillers, knowing its prospective dangers. The medical journal Lancet estimates that 88,000 Americans had heart attacks from taking Vioxx, and 38,000 of them died. Merck, eventually had to settle the biggest pharma lawsuit in history, to the tune of 4.85 billion dollars to thousands of people.

After the Pharmaceutical industry’s methodic profit-over-people campaign was realized, the Merck employee quit. She left the country, going to Europe saying, “I realized that just because something is on the market doesn’t mean it’s safe. Much of what we are told by the healthcare industry just simply isn’t the truth.”

To fight back, she started a non profit, Learn the Risk, to expose the dangers of the Pharmaceutical drug industry, including vaccines and unnecessary medical treatments that have caused illness and death in countless people outside the Merck trials. She instead dedicated her life to giving people natural, safe, holistic healing options.

Brandy was on a mission, and doing damage.

Learn The Risk had created over forty educational events and rallies in three years.

LTR’s monthly website traffic was at 10,000+.

And the organization had created over 42 billboards with an estimated reach of over 30 million people.

But she knew she was in danger after she returned to the United States with her then 6-month-old son and started receiving a multitude of death threats.

It got so bad, she recorded a 12 minute video detailing the home invasions and intimidation she was enduring, so that everyone could be aware of the pressure and danger she was in.

But the harassment didn’t stop, so she went on Facebook to write a public statement, detailing how if she’s been killed, to know it’s been done by the Pharmaceutical drug industry. 

And just as she predicted, tragedy soon struck. On December 7th, 2020, Brandy Vaughan was found dead by her 9-year-old son Bastien.

Anyone that’s stood up against government profit knows how real surveillance, intimidation, imprisonment and death is to those that challenge the system.

A spokesperson said the policy went out in error and the company would not be fining people for misinformation.
“An AUP notice recently went out in error that included incorrect information. PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and this language was never intended to be inserted in our policy. Our team is working to correct our policy pages. We’re sorry for the confusion this has caused,” PayPal said in an email.
They just lied to you. PayPal is not to be trusted.
News is spreading that PayPal has reinstated their policy to fine users $2,500 directly from their account if they “provide false, inaccurate or misleading information” according to its updated PayPal User Agreement.
“You are independently responsible for complying with all applicable laws in all of your actions related to your use of PayPal’s services, regardless of the purpose of the use. In addition, you must adhere to the terms of this Acceptable Use Policy. Violation of this Acceptable Use Policy constitutes a violation of the PayPal User Agreement and may subject you to damages, including liquidated damages of $2,500.00 U.S. dollars per violation, which may be debited directly from your PayPal account(s) as outlined in the User Agreement (see “Restricted Activities and Holds” section of the PayPal User Agreement).
Its Restricted Activities and Holds states, “In connection with your use of our websites, your PayPal account, the PayPal services, or in the course of your interactions with PayPal, other PayPal customers, or third parties, you must not provide false, inaccurate or misleading information.”
“If you’ve violated our Acceptable Use Policy, then you’re also responsible for damages to PayPal caused by your violation of this policy; or
“If you are a seller and receive funds for transactions that violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal’s damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy. You acknowledge and agree that $2,500.00 U.S. dollars per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal’s actual damages – including, but not limited to, internal administrative costs incurred by PayPal to monitor and track violations, damage to PayPal’s brand and reputation, and penalties imposed upon PayPal by its business partners resulting from a user’s violation – considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate. PayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control,” Paypal said.
Earlier this month, the former President of PayPal, David Marcus, blasted the policy — calling it “insanity” because “a private company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something they disagree with.” Even the new boss at Twitter agreed to his comment.
Several public figures have advocated for a boycott of PayPal over the company’s Orwellian “misinformation” policy, and some have already done so. Following a surge of online calls to close PayPal accounts, several users are reporting closing issues.
PayPal was reportedly bribing $15 worth of vouchers to account holders in a desperate move to prevent them from canceling their accounts, that only tells you how bad the situation is.
In case you haven’t already, this is a good time to cancel your PayPal account.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_551053,"Brazilian protesters shut down the road to the airport in Sao Paulo following the controversial election on Sunday night.

Socialist Lula da Silva allegedly defeated Jair Bolsonaro in the election Sunday.

Matthew Tyrmand joined Steve Bannon on Tuesday to discuss the latest developments following the controversial election in Brazil on Sunday.

As Joe Hoft at The Gateway Pundit reported earlier, the Brazilian Presidential Election iresembled the 2020 Presidential Election in the US. The operation looks like what we referred to at the time as the Drop and Roll.

The Sunday Brazilian election looked a lot like the 2020 Election in the US, where conservatives cleaned house across the board in legislative and in governor races.  Yet Bolsonaro somehow lost the presidency to a socialist tied to China. It did not make any sense in the US and it doesn’t make sense in Brazil.

Brazil relies entirely on voting machines for their elections.

Steve Bannon interviewed Mathew Tyrmand on the Brazil election.  Here are some excerpts from their discussion.

Bolsonaro’s party dominated the election.  The conservative parties, will dominate the lower House in Brazil.
Bolsonaro was winning the election up to a certain point and then every ballot drop was won by the socialist candidate.  “The math doesn’t make sense at all,” said Mathew Tyrmand.
The Mainstream Media all “pounded in immediately” says Bannon to claim the win for the socialist.
“There’s been no transparency.  There’s been censorship.  There’s been arrests of the opposition.  There’s been penalization from the court to Bolsonaro’s party,”  said Tyrmand.
The election in Brazil looks a lot like the US election of 2020.

On Tuesday Matthew Tyrmand said Jair Bolsonaro will deliver remarks later tonight.  According to Tyrmand, his contacts are telling him Bolsonaro may invoke the Constitution to demand the military hold an audit of the impossible results.

Bolsonaro may also jail the radical leftist court justices who made it a crime for populist party to campaign effectively.

Bolsonaro is not going quietly.  He is fighting back."

Politifact_FALSE_Social media_872386,"The Absentee Ballot situation in Detroit is REALLY BAD. People are showing up to Vote only to be told, “sorry, you have already voted.” This is happening in large numbers, elsewhere as well. Protest, Protest, Protest!"
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_139020,"Michigan polls closed at 8:00PM yesterday, election day 2022. The results strongly favoring Democrats shocked the pollsters and prognosticators, who all predicted some degree of a ‘red wave’ that never materialized.
The results directly conflict with the perception by many campaign professionals, pollsters, and those in the media that were predicting strong Republican gains.
But of course nothing was done in response to the 2020 voter fraud well-documented by outlets like the Gateway Pundit. In fact, the Republicans in Michigan even made it easier to cheat by allowing clerks two extra days to ‘process’ ballots, giving potential bad actor clerks more time to cheat. This is in addition to the widespread observations of major problems with voting machines.

The journey of a ballot once cast by a legitimate and legal voter is supposed to be the collection in a poll box, delivery to the clerk who then verifies the voter is a registered, legal voter in the state’s Qualified Voter File, known as the “QVF”, the signature of the voter is checked against the one on file, and the ballot is checked for any defects. City of Detroit whistleblower Jessy Jacob came forward in 2020 to say that there were no ballots that had to be processed after 9;00PM on election night because the process was so quick for the few remaining ballots that came in close to the deadline.
And as mentioned before, clerks have had two whole extra days to count ballots, meaning that there should have been almost none that came in late.

Ballots are counted in a particular order. Absentees are counted first, then those collected on election day by in-person voters, and then any late-arriving ballots. There is little to no reason for ballots to arrive late. There is certainly no legitimate reason short of fraud for tens of thousands of ballots to arrive and start processing hours after the deadline for them to be collected.
The Gateway Pundit has exclusive video and photographic evidence that the City of Detroit in Michigan was collecting thousands of ballots significantly after the legal deadline in 2022. This video is from the Detroit Department of Elections at 2978 West Grand. Ballots are processed there, entering and exiting through the garage in the alley behind the building.

We can exclusively report that the City of Detroit was handling and beginning to process a significant number of ballots at 11:30 PM on election night.

We can exclusively report that the City of Detroit was handling and beginning to process more ballots at 1:22 AM on election night.

Where did these ballots come from?

Why are they arriving at the Detroit Bureau of Election so suspiciously late on election night?
What could possibly account for so many ballots arriving so late?
Every Michigan ‘drop box’ is required to have a high-definition camera covering its location at all times. Michigan Patriots painstakingly examined the video from 2020 to determine how many legal votes could reasonably have been cast by dropping off ballots in the drop boxes, and the last hour of operation in 2020 the answer was about 100. The entire last day of operation showed that less than a thousand cast ballots by dropping them in ballot drop boxes. So there is no realistic way these observed ballots came from that source, and if they did not come from drop boxes, where did they come from?
Detroit/Wayne County is often the last jurisdiction to report their votes every election cycle. Republican activists have wondered whether that is a tactical decision so that they know how many votes are needed to suppress Republican votes for Senate, Governor, and for statewide proposals.

They stole the vote in 2020 from you, and it appears they may have stolen the vote from you again in 2022.
After the 2020 elections, Americans were repeatedly told that there was nothing wrong with the security and integrity of our elections.
Every single case that was filed with the judicial system was thrown out without ever hearing the presentation of evidence. No Judge wanted to face the evidence collected by election integrity patriots who painstakingly documented eyewitness statements, video evidence, statistical evidence, and expert testimony showing that the 2020 election was systematically stolen.
They were told that widespread descriptions of alleged voter fraud were widespread misinformation and disinformation.

They were told that a thousand collected affidavits were irrelevant. That the observed crimes by election workers, including unlawfully expelling only Republican poll watchers, using COVID illegally to exclude election integrity officials, and illegally sending out mass absentee voter applications were unproven theories even though they were well-documented.
They were also told that a 3:30AM van that arrived way past the 8PM legal deadline to collect ballots in 2020 was entirely normal. Many were even smeared and called ‘racists’ for just observing this voter fraud because so many major Democrat strongholds in Michigan happen to be places with a large black population.
For months the mainstream media lied about this van full of likely-illegal ballots in 2020. They initially said it didn’t exist. Then they said it was food for workers. Then they said it was camera equipment. Then they said even if it was ballots, it was just a few ballots and didn’t mean anything. Then the Gateway Pundit produced the footage that showed tens of thousands of late-arriving ballots being processed just as witnesses described in 2020, and the media never corrected their reporting, never apologized to the readers they lied to, or the way they defamed your Gateway Pundit, and nothing happened.
Detroit can cheat the vote right in front of witnessing Republicans and nothing will be done about it. Gateway Pundit Publisher Jim Hoft was banned from Twitter for reporting the simple factual video of the late-night van delivery of illegal ballots.

It’s notable that the jurisdictions Democrats cheat in usually have a friendly Soros-tied district attorney, with a friendly United States Attorney, with hard-left federal judges, and a hard-left Secretary of State and state Attorney General. If you wanted to alert authorities to the fraud, you have to complain to people more likely to put you in jail for “spreading disinformation” than they are to take your complaint seriously. Every judge at every level of the state and federal judiciary has similarly shown complete disinterest and disdain for their role in preserving election integrity. A federal Detroit Obama judge even sanctioned nine attorneys who dared file cases related to election integrity last year."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_244653,"The World Economic Forum’s climate change agenda was “modeled” off the effort to roll out vaccines during the Covid pandemic, John Kerry said during a COP27 panel discussion in Egypt on Tuesday.
That means we can all look forward to high-pressure, coercive government tactics, and not only from the government but from corporate elites.
Appearing alongside WEF President Børge Brende and various corporate executives, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry said that it is urgent for the private sector to pair with governments to realize the goal of preventing the global temperature from rising and to save lives in the allegedly looming global climate crisis, Breitbart reported.
Kerry said in a speech before the panel:
“We have an enormous challenge before us to bring to scale new technologies and to harness the deeply capable capacity of private sector entrepreneurs in order to bring them to the table because without it, no government has enough money… we need everybody behind this.”
King Charles has made similar statements, that we need nations to pool their resources and raise a trillion dollars to combat climate change.
Kerry further promoted the WEF’s launch of its First Movers Coalition, which he said was “needed to create demand signals in the market where they didn’t exist, which takes boldness, it takes courage from these executives who have made the decision to be a part of this.”
So there you have it. These globalists are on a mission to destroy not only the individual freedom that millions of Westerners have enjoyed in the Post-World War II era, but they also plan to destroy the market capitalism that led to a prosperous middle class. As long as the middle class is prosperous, it remains independent and capable of critical thinking. Wipe out their wealth and you wipe out their ability to think independently and make their own decisions.
Kerry admitted this was the goal in his COP27 speech when he said “we need to create demand signals in the market where they didn’t exist.” They want to artificially create demand where none exists for electric cars, fake meat grown in labs, replacing animal protein with crickets and other insects, solar and wind power in place of reliable coal and oil.
That’s not how capitalism works. But that’s what they’re going to try to force upon the world through ESGs and a Chinese point system that punishes those businesses and individuals who refuse to go along with the new system of government and corporate coercion.
Pope Francis has also called for replacing capitalism with a “new economic model” in the aftermath of Covid. In his recent book, he called for a “new economic system.”
The Catholic News Agency reports that, in his general audience address of September 30 in the San Damaso Courtyard of the Vatican, the pope criticized capitalism, calling it “unfair” and “unsustainable.”
“And certainly we cannot expect the economic model that underlies unfair and unsustainable development to solve our problems. It has not and will not, because it cannot do so, even though some false prophets continue to promise the ‘trickle-down’ that never comes.”
So by purposely drying up the food supply, paying farmers not to produce, forcing them to drastically reduce the use of fertilizers, making them cull their herds of livestock and replace that protein in the human diet with crickets and other insects, this is somehow going to be more “sustainable” and feed more people? This is the World Economic Forum/United Nations agenda that Pope Francis promotes, so don’t believe him when he says he’s for a more equitable, sustainable, peaceful world.
This pope is a deceiver. John Kerry is a deceiver. They talk about climate change in a context that makes people think they’re trying to benefit humanity. But when you lift the veneer of rhetorical altruism, what you find is an extremely anti-human line of policies that support the greater U.N. depopulation agenda.
According to the Independent Sentinel, Francis “wants the UN – the dictator’s club – to lead the world with this new system that sounds a lot like the World Economic Forum’s system.”
That’s because it is all the same tyrannical system being promoted right now by the four-legged beast — the political, the economic/corporate, the academic/media and the religious/spiritual realms."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_700567,"In a tragic turn of events, Santino Godoy Blanco, just 4 years old, has passed away from pneumonia on Nov. 3, according to multiple reports.

If that name sounds at all familiar to you, that’s because Blanco was the face of one of Argentina’s various vaccination campaigns.

You can see an example of the type of campaign that Blanco was featured in below:

The above ad is promoting vaccinations against measles, rubella, mumps and polio.

As multiple Argentinian outlets are reporting, the actual circumstances of Blanco’s tragic passing are raising some eyebrows.

Detail Zero noted that Blanco’s mother has filed a “complaint for abandonment” against Dr. Raul F. Larcade Municipal Hospital.

According to Blanco’s mother, her child had complained for a week that he wasn’t feeling well.

Blanco also reportedly suffered from a high fever.

The hospital, however, is being accused of sending the child back several times.

While the autopsy ultimately determined that Blanco died of pneumonia, the child reportedly received several different diagnoses, including gastroenterocolitis and laryngitis.

The mother, Augustina, explained that at first she was told her son’s condition was a viral issue. After the initial visit, in which she went because her son’s fever would not go down with basic ibuprofen, they were given the viral diagnosis and returned home.

That’s when Blanco began throwing up. His condition only worsened from there, before he eventually died.

“I’m not going to stop until the doctors who treated my son are removed,” Augustina allegedly told San Miguel Mayor Jaime Mendez.

Blanco’s tragic death does follow an alarming trend of perfectly healthy young people around the world passing away unexpectedly.

While Blanco’s death does appear to be a case of poor diagnosing, at least based on his mother’s account of events, it is still adding to a list that already includes too many young people.

For Brazil’s Ministry of Health, the passing of one of its campaign mascots has only added to a trying year for them.

As Reuters reports, last December, the Brazil health ministry’s website was hacked. Not only did several systems get taken down, hackers targeted information about the national immunization program and another used to issue digital vaccination certificates."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_99287,"The Covid-19 injections were meant to reduce the sudden surge of deaths the USA recorded in 2020 due to the alleged Covid-19 pandemic. But unfortunately, the official figures prove that the opposite has happened.
Official reports quietly published by the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirm that over 6 million Americans have died ever since the U.S. Food & Drug Administration granted emergency use authorisation to a Covid-19 vaccine in December 2020; with 2021 being a record-breaking year for deaths.
This sadly means that at least 1.1 million Americans may have ‘died suddenly’ during this time frame because according to the CDC reports there have been 1,106,079 excess deaths compared to the 2015-2019 five-year average.
And with further official Government figures confirming that mortality rates per 100,000 are highest among the vaccinated population in every single age group, it would appear Covid-19 vaccination is almost entirely to blame.

Compared to other countries, the U.S. Government has been terrible at publishing relevant and up-to-date data allowing us to analyse the consequences of rolling out the Covid-19 injections. However, we have finally managed to stumble upon it thanks to an institution known as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OEC).
The OEC is an intergovernmental organisation with 38 member countries founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. And for some reason, they host a wealth of data on excess deaths. You can find that data for yourself here.
The following chart has been created using the figures found in the OEC database. Figures that have been provided to the OEC by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). And it shows excess deaths across the USA by week in 2022 up to week 38 (25th September).

The above chart reveals that the USA has recorded a significant number of excess deaths every single week throughout 2022. With the grand total equating to 349,398 excess deaths by week 38.

This means 1,700 more Americans actually died by week 38 of 2022 than those who died by week 38 of 2020, despite the fact there was a huge wave of alleged Covid-19 deaths during this period.

But that’s not the worst of it. Because the official CDC figures reveal that 2021 was a record-breaking year for deaths across the USA, with the country recording over 100,000 more deaths than it recorded in 2020, prior to the roll-out of the experimental Covid-19 injections.

According to the CDC, by week 52 of 2020, America had suffered 3,355,807 deaths. But the following year, in 2021, the CDC confirms that America suffered 3,457,518 deaths.
This means 101,711 more people died in 2021 following the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out than they did in 2020 prior to the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out.
It also means America suffered 674,951 excess deaths in 2021 compared to the 2015-2019 five-year average.
The first Covid-19 injection was administered in the USA on December 14th 2020, and according to the quietly published figures provided by the CDC, 6,090,716 Americans sadly lost their lives after this date up until week 38 of 2022.

This means America has suffered at least 1,106,079 excess deaths ever since the U.S. Government decided to coerce millions of Americans into getting an experimental gene therapy (Covid-19 injection).

So like we said at the beginning, the Covid-19 injections were meant to reduce the sudden surge of deaths the USA recorded in 2020 due to the alleged Covid-19 pandemic. But unfortunately, the official figures prove that the opposite has happened.
The question is, why?
The answer to that question can be found in an official report published by the UK Government.

The report was published in July by the UK Government organisation known as the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and it is titled ‘Deaths by Vaccination Status, England, 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2022‘. It can be accessed on the ONS site here or downloaded here.

Table 2 of the report contains the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status by age group for deaths per 100,000 person-years in England up to May 2022.
Here’s how the ONS present the data for 18 to 39-year-olds in May 2022 –

We’ve taken the figures provided by the ONS for January to May 2022 and produced the following charts which reveal the horrific consequences of the mass Covid-19 vaccination campaign.
18 to 39-year-olds
The following chart shows the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status among 18 to 39-year-olds for Non-Covid-19 deaths in England between January and May 2022 –

In every single month since the beginning of 2022, partly vaccinated and double vaccinated 18-39-year-olds have been more likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds. Triple vaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds however have had a mortality rate that has worsened by the month following the mass Booster campaign that occurred in the UK in December 2021.
In January, triple vaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds were ever so slightly less likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds, with a mortality rate of 29.8 per 100,000 among the unvaccinated and 28.1 per 100,000 among the triple vaccinated.
But this all changed from February onwards. In February, triple vaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds were 27% more likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds, with a mortality rate of 26.7 per 100k among the triple vaccinated and 21 per 100k among the unvaccinated.
Things have unfortunately got even worse for the triple vaccinated by May 2022 though. The data shows that triple vaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds were 52% more likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds in May, with a mortality rate of 21.4 per 100k among the triple vaccinated and 14.1 among the unvaccinated.
The worst figures so far though are among the partly vaccinated, with May seeing partly vaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds 202% more likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds.

We see pretty much the same when it comes to 40 to 49-year-olds. In every single month since the beginning of 2022, partly vaccinated and double vaccinated 40 to 49-year-olds have been more likely to die than unvaccinated 40 to 49–year-olds.
The worst month for mortality rates among the partly and double vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated was February. This month saw partly vaccinated 40-49-year-olds 264% more likely to die than unvaccinated 40-49-year-olds. Whilst double vaccinated 40-49-year-olds were 61% more likely to die than unvaccinated 40-49-year-olds.
By May 2022, five months after the mass Booster campaign, triple vaccinated 40-49-year-olds were 40% more likely to die than unvaccinated 40-49-year-olds, with a mortality rate of 81.8 per 100k among the triple vaccinated and a mortality rate of 58.4 among the unvaccinated.
50 to 59-year-olds
The following chart shows the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status among 50 to 59-year-olds for Non-Covid-19 deaths in England between January and May 2022 –

Yet again we see exactly the same pattern among 50 to 59-year-olds as seen among 40-49-year-olds.
In every single month since the beginning of 2022, partly vaccinated and double vaccinated 50 to 59-year-olds have been more likely to die than unvaccinated 50-59–year-olds.
May was the worst month for partly vaccinated 50 to 59-year-olds, as they were 170% more likely to die than unvaccinated 50 to 59-year-olds.
Whereas January was the worst month for double vaccinated 50-59-year-olds, as they were 115% more likely to die than unvaccinated 50-59-year-olds.
By May 2022, five months after the mass Booster campaign, triple vaccinated 50-59-year-olds were 17% more likely to die than unvaccinated 50-59-year-olds, with a mortality rate of 332 per 100k among the triple vaccinated and a mortality rate of 282.9 per 100k among the unvaccinated.
Therefore, by May 2022, unvaccinated 50-59-year-olds were the least likely to die among all vaccination groups.

60 to 69-year-olds
The following chart shows the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status among 60 to 69-year-olds for Non-Covid-19 deaths in England between January and May 2022 –

The 60 to 69-year-olds show exactly the same pattern as 18 to 39-year-olds. The double and partly vaccinated have been more likely to die than the unvaccinated since the turn of the year, and the triple vaccinated have been more likely to die than the unvaccinated since February.
In January, partly vaccinated 60-69-year-olds were a shocking 256% more likely to die than unvaccinated 60-69-year-olds. Whilst in the same month, double vaccinated 60-69-year-olds were 223% more likely to die than unvaccinated 60-69-year-olds.
By May, triple vaccinated 60-69-year-olds were a troubling 117% more likely to die than unvaccinated 60-69-year-olds, with a mortality rate of 1801.3 per 100k among the triple vaccinated and a mortality rate of just 831.1 among the unvaccinated.
70 to 79–year-olds
The following chart shows the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status among 70 to 79-year-olds for Non-Covid-19 deaths in England between January and May 2022 –

Things are slightly different for 70 to 70-year-olds because the data reveals the unvaccinated have been the least likely to die every month since the turn of the year.
In January, the partly vaccinated were 198% more likely to die than the unvaccinated, whilst the double vaccinated were a shocking 267% more likely to die than the unvaccinated.
The worst figures however come in May, which saw triple vaccinated 70-79-year-olds a disturbing 332% more likely to die than unvaccinated 70-79-year-olds, with a mortality rate of 9417.2 per 100k among the triple vaccinated and just 2181 per 100k among the unvaccinated.
80 to 89-year-olds
The following chart shows the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status among 80 to 89-year-olds for Non-Covid-19 deaths in England between January and May 2022 –

Again we see the same pattern among 80-89-year-olds as seen among 70-79-year-olds, with the unvaccinated the least likely to die every month since the turn of the year.
In April, double vaccinated 80-89-year-olds were 213% more likely to die than unvaccinated 80-89-year-olds, with a mortality rate of 7598.9 per 100k among the unvaccinated and a mortality rate of a troubling 23,781.8 per 100k among the double vaccinated.
But in the same month, partly vaccinated 80-89-year-olds were a terrifying 672% more likely to die than unvaccinated 80-89-year-olds, with a shocking mortality rate of 58,668.9 per 100k among the partly vaccinated.
By May 2022, triple vaccinated 80-89-year-olds were 142% more likely to die than unvaccinated 80-89-year-olds, with a mortality rate of 14,002.3 among the triple vaccinated and a mortality rate of 5,789.1 among the unvaccinated.
90 + year-olds
The following chart shows the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status among 90+ year-olds for Non-Covid-19 deaths in England between January and May 2022 –

Finally, we again see the same pattern among 90+ year-olds, with the unvaccinated the least likely to die every month since the turn of the year.
In April, double vaccinated 90+ year-olds were 244% more likely to die than unvaccinated 90+ year-olds, with a mortality rate of 62,302.7 per 100k among the double vaccinated and a mortality rate of 18,090.6 among the unvaccinated.
During the same month, however, partly vaccinated 90+ year-olds were a shocking 572% more likely to die than unvaccinated 90+ year-olds, with a mortality rate of 121,749.9 per 100k person-years among the partly vaccinated.
By May 2022, triple vaccinated 90+ year-olds were 26% more likely to die than unvaccinated 90+ year-olds, with a mortality rate of 13,761.6 per 100k among the unvaccinated and a mortality rate of 17,272.2 per 100k among the triple vaccinated.

The following three charts show the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status for non-Covid-19 deaths in England between January and May 2022 as detailed above but collated together for all age groups –

All of the above is, therefore, indisputable evidence that Covid-19 vaccination increases a person’s risk of death, and is causing more deaths than would have otherwise occurred if the Covid-19 vaccine has not been rolled-out.
So it looks like we’ve found the answer as to why the USA suffered over 1.1 million excess deaths ever since the U.S. Government decided to coerce millions of Americans into getting the experimental Covid-19 injections."

According to Bloomberg, researchers revived nearly two dozen viruses - including one frozen under a lake more than 48,500 years ago. 

While studying permafrost they revived and characterized 13 new pathogens, what they termed “zombie viruses,” and found that they remained infectious despite spending many millennia trapped in the frozen snow caps.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_562440,"Residents will be confined to their local neighbourhood and have to ask permission to leave it  all to 'save the planet'.

Oxfordshire County Council yesterday approved plans to lock residents into one of six zones to 'save the planet' from global warming.  The latest stage in the '15 minute city' agenda is to place electronic gates on key roads in and out of the city, confining residents to their own neighbourhoods.  

Under the new scheme if residents want to leave their zone they will need permission from the Council who gets to decide who is worthy of freedom and who isn't.  Under the new scheme residents will be allowed to leave their zone a maximum of 100 days per year, but in order to even gain this every resident will have to register their car details with the council who will then track their movements via smart cameras round the city.  

Communism will make the weather better.
Oxfordshire County Council, which is run by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party, secretly decided to divide-up the city of Oxford into six ‘15 minute’ districts in 2021 soon after they were elected to office.  None of the councillors declared their intention of imprisoning local residents in their manifestos of course, preferring to make vague claims about how they will 'improve the environment' instead.  

Every resident will be required to register their car with the County Council who will then monitor how many times they leave their district via number plate recognition cameras.  And don’t think you can beat the system if you’re a two car household.  Those two cars will be counted as one meaning you will have to divide up the journeys between yourselves. 2 cars 50 journeys each;  3 cars 33 journeys each and so on.

Under the new rules, your social life becomes irrelevant.  By de facto Councils get to dictate how many times per year you can see friends and family.  You will be stopped from fraternising with anyone outside your district, and if you want a long distance relationship in the future, forget it, you are confined to dating only those within a 15 minute walk of your house.

A single person’s life will be at the mercy of Communists in central office, dictating the same type of draconian rules we had to avert the last crisis, a mild flu virus so deadly 80% of people didn't even know they had it. 

An entirely new social structure is being imposed on Oxford's residents ( and more cities are to follow) under the lie of saving the planet.  but what it really is, is a plan for Command and Control.   There will be permits, penalties and even more ubiquitous surveillance.  Council officials will determine where you can go and how often, and will log every time you do. 15-minute cities, or 15 minute prisons?"

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_846552,"There is a demonic portal that opened above the White House after President Joe Biden moved in and it is visible for those who are looking for it, according to Roger Stone who says Arlington, Virginia police have confirmed the visibility of the portal.

Stone told conservative radio host Eric Metaxas he has seen it “swirling like a cauldron” above the White House, as have others who spent enough time looking. During Sunday’s edition of The Eric Metaxas Radio Show, the host asked Stone to repeat to him on the air an anecdote he had previously shared.

“I think that…  a portal, a demonic portal, opened above the White House around the time that the Bidens moved in,” Stone said. “This was brought to my attention by a Christian who lives in north Florida who sent me a bunch of documents and also a bunch of notations from the Bible about portals.”

Stone said he first expressed skepticism about the existence of the portal above 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, which Metaxas praised him for. Stone said:
“So, I was skeptical about it but I looked at the photos. Also, there’s a live cam where you can actually see in real-time and there does appear to be something above the White House… At first you say, “Oh, maybe it’s a reflection. Maybe it’s an aerostat balloon. Maybe there’s a logical [explanation.]”

Mediate report that Stone said he called a friend of his who is a police officer in Arlington, Virginia, and asked him to investigate it. Arlington police responded by confirming that many people have seen the portal above the White House.
“He called me back about two-and-a-half hours later and said, ‘You’re not going to believe this, but there’s definitely something there. Other people were there photographing it,’” Stone said he was told.
Stone said if one zooms in on whatever is floating above the Biden White House, it can be seen “swirling like a cauldron.”
The host asked why the media has given no coverage to the portal. Stone responded, “The media doesn’t cover a lot of things that are true.”

It’s not the first time Stone has spoken publicly about the portal. He told an audience at the ReAwaken America Tour event in South Carolina in May this year that you can see it “day and night.”
“There is a Satanic portal above the White House, you can see it day and night,” he said. “It exists. It is real. And it must be closed. And it will be closed by prayer,” he added, drawing claps and cheers. Stone went on to claim that this portal first appeared after Biden “became president, and it will be closed before he leaves.”"
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_684804,"Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine has been linked to blood clotting in older individuals, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

FDA researchers, crunching data from a database of elderly persons in the United States, found that pulmonary embolism—blood clotting that forms in the body and winds up blocking blood flow in the lungs—met the initial threshold for a statistical signal and continued meeting the criteria after a more in-depth evaluation.

Three other outcomes of interest—a lack of oxygen to the heart, a blood platelet disorder called immune thrombocytopenia, and another type of clotting called intravascular coagulation—initially raised red flags, researchers said. More in-depth evaluations, such as comparisons with populations who received influenza vaccines, showed those three as no longer meeting the statistical threshold for a signal.

Researchers looked at data covering 17.4 million elderly Americans who received a total of 34.6 million vaccine doses between Dec. 10, 2020, and Jan. 16, 2022.

The study was published by the journal Vaccine on Dec. 1.
The FDA said it wasn't taking any action on the results because they don't prove the vaccines cause any of the four outcomes, and because the findings ""are still under investigation and require more robust study.""

Dr. Peter McCullough, chief medical adviser for the Truth for Health Foundation, told The Epoch Times via email that the new paper ""corroborates the concerns of doctors that the large uptick in blood clots, progression of atherosclerotic heart disease, and blood disorders is independently associated with COVID-19 vaccination.""

Pfizer didn't respond to a request for comment.

How the Research Was Done

FDA researchers, with assistance from researchers with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), analyzed data from the CMS database. They included Medicare Fee-for-Service beneficiaries aged 65 or older who received a vaccine within the timeframe, were enrolled when they were vaccinated, and were enrolled for a ""clean window"" of time prior to vaccination. The window was 183 days or 365 days, depending on the outcome.
About 25 million people receive the Medicare Fee-for-Service, but only about 17 million were vaccinated during the period of time studied.

Researchers used probability testing to detect an increased risk of one or more of 14 outcomes following vaccination. The goal was to see whether vaccination may increase the risk of adverse outcomes, such as pulmonary embolism, or blood clotting in the lungs. If an outcome met a certain statistical threshold, that meant it could increase the risk.

The initial results of the safety monitoring detected an increased risk of four events, the FDA announced on July 12, 2021—months after first detecting the possible issues. They were the same four outlined in the new paper, which is the first update the agency has given on the matter since its announcement.
As of Jan. 15, 9,065 cases of a lack of oxygen to the heart—known as acute myocardial infarction—were detected, researchers revealed in the new study. As of the same date, 6,346 cases of pulmonary embolism, 1,064 cases of immune thrombocytopenia, and 263 cases of coagulation were detected.

The primary analysis showed a safety signal for all four outcomes. Researchers tried adjusting the numbers by using different variables. For instance, at one point they adjusted for the variation of background rates, or the rates of each outcome in the general population prior to the pandemic. After certain adjustments—not all—the myocardial infarction, immune thrombocytopenia, and intravascular coagulation ceased being statistically significant.

Pulmonary embolism, though, continued to be statistically significant, the researchers said. Pulmonary embolism is a serious condition that can lead to death.

Limitations of the study included possible false signals and possible missed signals due to factors such as parameters being specified wrongly.

The conditions that didn't trigger a signal included stroke, heart inflammation, and appendicitis.

The signals were detected only after Pfizer vaccination. Analyses for signals after receipt of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines didn't show any concerns.

Moderna and Johnson & Johnson didn't respond to requests for comment.
Side Effects

All three vaccines have been linked to a number of side effects. Heart inflammation is causally linked to the Moderna and Pfizer shots, experts around the world have confirmed, while Johnson & Johnson's has been associated with blood clots.
Other conditions, such as pulmonary embolism, have been reported to authorities and described in studies, though some papers have found no increase in risk following vaccination.
Approximately 4,214 reports of post-vaccination pulmonary embolism, including 1,886 reports following receipt of Pfizer's vaccine, have been reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System as of Dec. 9.

As of the same date, 1,434 reports of post-vaccination myocardial infarction, including 736 following receipt of Pfizer's vaccine; 469 reports of post-vaccination immune thrombocytopenia, including 234 following receipt of Pfizer's vaccine; and 78 reports of post-vaccination intravascular coagulation, including 42 after receipt of Pfizer's vaccine, have been reported.

Reports to the system can be made by anybody, but most are lodged by health care workers, studies show. The number of reports are an undercount, according to studies.

The new study states that the FDA ""strongly believes the potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the potential risks of COVID-19 infection."" No evidence was cited in support of the belief.

The FDA is set to meet with its vaccine advisory panel in January 2023 about the future of COVID-19 vaccines, as the vaccines have been performing much worse against Omicron and its subvariants.

""A shortcoming of the CMS surveillance system is that it did not capture prior and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection which accentuate the cumulative risk of COVID-19 vaccination,"" McCullough told The Epoch Times. ""Given the large number of individuals who have been vaccinated, the population attributable fraction of medical problems ascribed to the vaccines is enormous. I have concerns over the future burden to the healthcare system as a consequence of mass indiscriminate COVID-19 vaccination."""

(Average athlete cardiacs before vax was 29/yr).

“Science” ignores this.

That’s why people ask questions."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_606375,"I. The heart attack

We said it would happen and it happened. A vaccinated NFL player’s heart stopped during the first quarter of Monday Night Football.

It’s not complicated. If you repeatedly inject billions of people with a shot known to cause blood clots you’re going to see lots of heart attacks — everywhere — at school, at the gym, during a live newscast, at the mall, on the highway, and during sporting events.

Players, coaches, staff, and fans will also have heart attacks in the NBA, NHL, and Major League Baseball in the coming years.

The outcome of the NCAA basketball final last year was influenced by the fact that a star player for North Carolina, “fully vaccinated” of course, had to leave the game with myocarditis. But we’re not allowed to talk about that and so it keeps happening.

II. The movement blinks

Within minutes of the heart attack Pharma used MedTwitter to flood the zone with a lie — that the heart attack was definitely a result of “commotio cordis” — an extremely rare sports injury whereby a kid struck in the chest (usually by a baseball) can experience cardiac arrest.

There are all sorts of reasons why this is false. Unlike baseball players, football players wear hard plastic chest protectors. The tackle was not unusual and if anything Hamlin shifted his body to the side in ways that deflected the collision. And commotio cordis usually only happens in kids under 15 years old — by the time one is an adult the body is more fully developed to protect the heart from such a blow. But that did not stop every vaccine injury denialist on Twitter from shouting from the rooftops that the tackle, and not the deadly vaccine, was the culprit.

At the same time MedTwitter told us — vaccine skeptics — to STFU and that any speculation on our part was dishonoring Damar Hamlin and his family.

So first they lied and then they tried to silence us.

I’m disappointed by the fact that some of the big name newbies in our movement immediately fell for the “commotio cordis” psyop. I imagine that they fell for it because they are scared of the enormity of the truth — that is: we are living in the midst of a genocide.

I’m grateful for everyone who has joined our movement but you need to know that mainstream society is never going to let you rejoin them. So you may as well stand and fight instead of taking a dive anytime Pharma gives you the opportunity to distance yourself from those damn dirty anti-vaxxers.

I should also add that I didn’t see any of the big players in the movement (who have been doing this for a long time) step up either. At a time when the movement could have used some leadership, the bigs went silent as well. Please correct me if I’m wrong, perhaps their accounts are just so suppressed by the algorithm that it’s impossible to get the message out? And I hope in the coming days that they will come out with statements that reflect the enormity of the crime that we just witnessed.

There’s not really any point in being unbanned on Twitter if we don’t use our voice when the moment comes.

III. The art of shaping the narrative

When a big event like this happens — you have anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes to shape the narrative. That’s it. A narrative is like wet concrete — it’s really important to have structures in place to guide it and you only have a short window of time to shape it before it hardens. Once the narrative is set, it’s rock solid, new facts will bounce off of it. Pharma understands this which is why they flooded the zone with the “commotio cordis” lie as quickly as possible and tried to keep us out of the conversation.

Meanwhile many people on our team were twiddling their thumbs waiting for more evidence. But here’s the thing — no more evidence is coming. The hospital will never release info that implicates the vaccine and if he dies, there will never be a proper autopsy. So there is no later reckoning — you either take the info that you have right now and go with it — before the narrative is set — or Pharma wins the narrative war and the teachable moment disappears.

The right thing to do on Monday night was to drop everything, watch the clip repeatedly, think through the possibilities from a number of angles, check to see if someone else has a smart take, and then rush to the barricades to fight like hell to shape the narrative. Again, you only have 5 to 45 minutes to shape the debate so don’t piss it away with bothsidesism.

Mark Crispin Miller understood the assignment. He walked through the facts, connected the dots, and published a Substack article within minutes of the game being suspended. The article was subtle but the subheadline said everything you need to know:

With “Monday Night Football” taking a traumatic turn, it’s now impossible to keep denying what the architects of this unprecedented global horror have done to all of us.

That was the correct take.

I grabbed Mark’s article and immediately posted it (from my burner account) in the replies to the Twitter accounts of Rochelle Walensky, Ashish Jha, and Robert Califf — with the comment, “This is on you.”

Then I grabbed The Highwire clip that shows hundreds of other athletes collapsing in a similar fashion and posted it in reply to anyone trying to argue for the Pharma psyops narrative. Lots of warrior moms and dads and people injured by the Covid shots were in the trenches fighting to shape the narrative as well.

By the end of the night, most of the people on our side who had fallen for the psyop had backed off and acknowledged that this was a heart attack likely caused by the Covid shots.

IV. Pharma’s flex

As Frantz Fanon taught us 60 years ago in The Wretched of the Earth, one of the biggest challenges any revolutionary movement faces is that most colonization is internal — oppressed people tend to see the world through the mindset of their oppressors.

Furthermore in Power a Radical View, Steven Lukes demonstrates that actual power shapes the aspirations and ideation of oppressed groups.

And so it is with the current iatrogenocide — many victims embrace the narrative supplied by their oppressors.

What Pfizer did to Damar Hamlin is the same thing that Derek Chauvin did to George Floyd — 9 minutes without breath.

But there will be no statement from the NAACP, Black Lives Matter, Southern Poverty Law Center, the Democratic Party, nor the NFL Player’s Association about the shots that stopped Damar Hamlin’s heart. Such a possibility does not even cross their minds. It’s unthinkable.

The internal mental colonization is so great that most Americans will reach for any excuse, no matter how preposterous, to exonerate the shots.

Pfizer literally killed a Black man (stopped his heart for 9 minutes) on live TV and then told all Americans to shut up if they know what’s good for them. That’s the sort of power that Julius Caesar, Stalin, and Mao possessed — and now that raw murderous totalitarian power is in the hands of the most ruthless corporation on earth. And the establishment has made it clear that we will be banished from polite society if we talk about the actual cause.

So that’s the world we live in. Pharma has killed several hundred thousand Americans and millions more around the world with the clot shot. Then they killed a guy in the first quarter of Monday Night Football and there will be no investigation and we’re all just supposed to nod our heads and blame it on coincidence.

Like everyone, I am grateful that paramedics were eventually able to restart Damar Hamlin’s heart. I hope and pray that he makes a miraculous recovery and returns to playing the game that he loves. In the meantime, I’m going to work to overthrow the Pharma state that caused his heart attack. And I encourage all of us to be prepared for the next heart attack on live TV and the next and the next, because they are coming.

Blessings to the warriors. 🙌

Prayers for everyone fighting to stop the iatrogenocide. 🙏

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_179096,"Science™ tells us that infants (medical definition: baby up to 1 year old) can have “Diverse Sexual Orientations, Gender Identities, and Sex Development.”

How do I know this? Harvard Medical School teaches its students how to care for such infants in a culturally appropriate manner.
Good to know. Most people think that infants are learning what it means to have a body, and aren’t aware that sexuality is even a thing. But our practitioners of medicine know better and are thankfully aware that babies are highly sexual beings with strong physical sexual attractions to people of various types, or could even be longing to cut off their own pee-pee or breasts.
It’s a complex topic. But if you think about it there are obvious tells that the heteronormative cisgender patriarchy has been diverting our attention from.
For instance, have you noticed that infants assigned the gender “female” at birth are strongly attracted to women’s breasts? If you think about it that means they are lesbian or at least bisexual. And infants assigned “male” often play with their own pee-pees, and if offered the opportunity notice their sperm-donor parent has one too. They may even touch it if the opportunity arises.
They, too, are very interested in and often fondle breast, implying their own bisexuality.
Babies even resist wearing clothes, another example of latent Queer identity. Add it all up and there clearly has been a conspiracy to obscure the fact that all infants are gender nonconforming. Those bastard biologists have been holding out on us, probably because they want breasted individuals to cook, clean, and make sandwiches instead of enjoy the full life experience of pushing paper in a cubicle.

It’s good to know that Harvard will not only help doctors become sensitive to the special needs of “gender and sexual minority” infants, but that they will help them engage in advocacy along with a mentor. Just what the doctor ordered!

Included with this training will of course be gender reassignment treatments, since Massachusetts General has a clinic that focuses on transgender treatments.
Now obviously there are people with diverse sexual orientations, and people with gender dysphoria, so medical training in these areas of practice is necessary. The last thing anybody needs is a refusal to deal with patients as they come to get care. Patients need doctors who can work with their particular needs to keep them healthy or treat their illnesses.

But if they are focusing on the sexual identities of infants they aren’t doing medicine, they are cult members grooming young children into their ideology and sexual practices.
Unfortunately, woke ideology has captured the commanding heights of our culture. The sciences themselves have become so perverted that we not only can’t trust their conclusions–we can’t even trust their basic motives.
There was a time when I would just assume that a Harvard trained physician would be above average. Now, I am pretty sure that isn’t the case. They may be smart, but their training is suspect.
It’s a good thing we are importing our doctors from India. Their training is less likely to be corrupt, I suspect."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_955695,"Executive summary

In the October 2022 version of the FAA Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners, the FAA quietly widened the EKG parameters beyond the normal range (from a PR max of .2 to unlimited). And they didn’t widen the range by a little. They widened it by a lot. It was done after the vaccine rollout.
This is extraordinary. They did it hoping nobody would notice. It worked for a while. Nobody caught it.
But you can’t hide these things for long.
This is a tacit admission from the US government that the COVID vaccine has damaged the hearts of our pilots. Not just a few pilots. A lot of pilots and a lot of damage.
The cardiac harm of course is not limited to pilots.
My best guess right now is that over 50M Americans sustained some amount of heart damage from the shot.
That’s a lot of people who will be very upset when they realize the vaccine they took to reduce their chance of dying from COVID actually worked in reverse making it:
More likely that people will get COVID
Be hospitalized from COVID and other diseases
Die from COVID (and other diseases)
You also have an excellent chance of getting a lifetime of heart damage for no extra charge.
But don’t worry; you can’t sue them. They fixed the law so none of them aren’t liable (the doctors, the drug companies, the government). After all, you took the vaccine of your own free will. It’s not like you were forced (or coerced) to take it or anything like that! And there were plenty of people warning you not to take the shots (even though they censored most of them).
In this article, I will explain the evidence and thinking behind all my claims.
As I learn more, I will refine the estimate.
Introduction

On October 24, 2022, the FAA quietly, without any announcement at all, widened the EKG requirements necessary for pilots to be able to fly.
The PR (a measure of heart function) used to be in the range of .12 to .2.
It is now: .12 to .3 and potentially even higher.
This is a very wide range; it accommodates people who have cardiac injury. Cardiologist Thomas Levy is appalled at this change:

Why did they make the change?

Why would they do that?
I’ll take an educated guess as to why they did that. I believe it is because they knew if they kept the original range, too many pilots would have to be grounded. That would be extremely problematic; commercial aviation in the US would be severely disrupted.
And why did they do that quietly without notifying the public or the mainstream media?
I’m pretty sure they won’t tell me, so I’ll speculate: it’s because they didn’t want anyone to know.
In other words, the COVID vaccine has seriously injured a lot of pilots and the FAA knows it and said nothing because that would tip off the country that the vaccines are unsafe. And you aren’t allowed to do that.
Why we sure it was the vaccine that did it

There are several clues that are consistent with “it was the vaccine and not COVID”:
They were quiet about it. If it was COVID, you can be public. But the vaccine is supposed to be safe.
The timing. October 2022 is late for COVID. If it was due to COVID, it would have happened well before now. They can make changes every month.
The vaccine creates far more injury to the heart than COVID (which creates NO added risk per this large-scale Israeli study of 196,992 unvaccinated adults after Covid infection).
Anecdotally, cardiologists only started to notice the damage post-vaccine.
All the sudden deaths started post-vaccine.
The data supporting my 20% damage estimate

I know from a study of 177 people in Puerto Rico (97% of whom were vaccinated) ages 8 to 84, that 70% of those people, when screened for cardiac injury using an FDA-approved testing device (from Heart Care Corp), exhibited objective signs of cardiac injury.
There was a study done on pilots. It will be published in The Epoch Times later this week. That indicated heart damage in over 20% of pilots screened (The Epoch Times will release the exact number).
The Thailand study showed nearly 30% of kids had abnormal cardiac biomarkers after the shot. But kids are indestructible so a 30% injury rate in kids translates into a higher rate for adults.
VAERS shows that cardiac damage happens at all ages, not just the young:

Bottom line: The most logical conclusion is that the FAA knows the hearts of our nations pilots have been injured by the COVID vaccine that they were coerced into taking, the number of pilots affected is huge, the cardiac damage is extensive, and passenger safety is being compromised by the lowering of the standards to enable pilots to fly.
The right thing would be for the FAA to come clean and admit to the American public that the COVID vaccine has injured 20% or more of the pilots (based on their limited EKG screening), but I doubt that they will ever do that.
The change: from 200 msec to 300 msec and beyond

The changes were made on October 24, 2022 to the GUIDE FOR AVIATION MEDICAL EXAMINERS.
Here is the change log where you can see the change listed (see page 4):

Here is what the policy was before the change. It was just one row:

Here are what it looks like as of Oct 24, 2022 (click the image to see the context):

So it’s now two rows, one for less than 300 ms (it used to be 200 ms), and a second row to handle 300 ms or more.
For more information about the change, see Myocarditis: Once Rare, Now Common.
The Thailand study

In the US, we are not allowed to do lab tests on people before and after the vaccine.
The reason for that is simple: it would make it crystal clear that the vaccines are unsafe. That is why there are no before/after studies in the US. There never will be.
Why? Because that is how science works in America today: it’s unethical to design a study that might expose that the COVID vaccines that they forced us to take cause harm.
Think I’m kidding about how they game the trials? Get yourself a copy of Turtles All the Way Down and just read the first chapter. It’s eye opening.
Even though we can’t do a before/after study in the US, they did such a study in Thailand on 301 kids. They found that 29.24% of the participants developed cardiac injuries within days after they got the second shot:

But here’s the most important part about that study that nobody points out:
None of the tests that were done in the Thailand study included doing a cardiac MRI with contrast on all the participants since that would be expensive and invasive. That test is the gold-standard for cardiac injury.
In other words, the 29% rate of injury was a lower bound of injury.
If you did a cardiac MRI on all those kids, you are going to find stuff that you will not find using the cheap and easy tests. Maybe a lot of stuff.
Summary

I believe that the actual rate of heart injury from these vaccines will be found to be well over the 29.7% rate of heart damage in the Thailand study.
At a more conservative 20% injury rate, we are looking at 50M Americans with heart damage caused by the jab.
As more studies are done, it’s going to be crystal clear why so many people are dying suddenly, especially kids. It’s also going to explain why nursing homes have lost up to 33% of their residents in 12 months where before they were losing only 1 or 2% a year. It’s going to explain why I was unable to find even a single nursing home where the all-cause mortality dropped after the vaccines rolled out. And it’s going to explain why none of the nursing homes wanted to talk to me about what happened to people after the shots rolled out.
Confidence in the CDC and the medical community should hit rock bottom after it is revealed how extensive the damage caused by these vaccines is.
The fact that the Thailand study was published in a peer-reviewed journal, that they only did the easy-to-do assessments (which only found a portion of the damage), and the FAA quietly changed their EKG guidance should at least open your mind to the possibility that I might be right.
This narrative is going to start falling apart at an accelerated rate.
Stay tuned. The best is yet to come. And it’s going to be epic."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_29464,"California may have disenfranchised millions of voters in the 2022 primary and general elections, according to a new report from the Public Interest Legal Foundation, an election integrity watchdog group. 

The report found that 226,250 mail ballots were rejected for various reasons, while election officials failed to account for millions more.

The 2022 midterms marked the first election held since the California Legislature passed and Gov. Gavin Newsom signed AB 37, which required automatically mailing ballots to all active registered voters in the nation’s most populous state. 

“As states across our country continue to enact undemocratic voter suppression laws, California is increasing voter access, expanding voting options and bolstering elections integrity and transparency,” Newsom said after signing the bill in September 2021.

That clearly hasn’t been the result of the law, said J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, on Wednesday.

“Mail ballots disenfranchise. There are many reasons mail ballots fail ultimately to count,” Adams said in a press statement. “No one casting a ballot at home can correct an error before it’s too late. California’s vote-by-mail demonstration should serve as a warning to state legislators elsewhere.”   

Election officials failed to account for the 10 million ballots for multiple reasons, according to the legal foundation’s report. 

“After accounting for polling place votes and rejected ballots in November 2022, there were more than 10 million ballots left outstanding, meaning election officials do not know what happened to them,” the report says. “It is fair to assume that the bulk of these were ignored or ultimately thrown out by the intended recipients. But, under mass mail elections, we can only assume what happened.”

The report says election officials rejected the 226,250 ballots for nine reasons. A whopping 47.7% of ballots arrived too late to count. California law requires mail ballots to be postmarked no later than Election Day and to arrive for counting no later than seven days after Election Day. 

The U.S. Postal Service says it averages a 94% success rate in delivering political mail in a timely fashion, according to the report. That leaves room for a significant number of individual ballots. Nationally, however, the USPS says it delivered at a 99% rate for election mail in 2022. 

“In the November contests, more than 57,000 ballots arrived after November 15, setting them up for rejection,” the report says. “The official datasets do not differentiate between ballots postmarked too late or delivered too late.” 

A spokesperson for California Secretary of State Shirley Weber’s office responded to The Daily Signal after the story was initially published without comment, but provided links from the office that confirmed the rejected 226,250 ballots. According to the Secretary of State’s office, there were 105,818 rejected or challenged ballots in the primary election and 120,432 rejected or challenged ballots in the general election.  

The second biggest reason for rejected ballots was a signature mismatch, accounting for 39.8% of ballots. Another 9.8% of ballots had no signature, according to the report. 

Officials rejected fewer than 1% of ballots—or 813 ballots statewide—because the voter voted both by mail and in person. Also, officials rejected fewer than 1% of the ballots for other reasons, such as including the wrong address on the envelope, multiple ballots in a single envelope, or a missing ballot from the envelope. 

This story was updated to include information provided by the California Secretary of State’s office."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_635536,"Scientists are now warning the public that consuming eggs could cause blood clots, strokes and heart attacks.

According to a new study, a nutrient found in eggs increases the risk of blood clotting.

Express.co.uk reports: The study conducted by Cleveland Clinic, suggested that choline could make the blood more prone to clotting.
Choline is sometimes sold in over-the-counter dietary supplements.
It is deemed an essential nutrient that is widely recommended for optimal health.
According to Medical News Today, it supports various bodily functions, including cellular growth and metabolism.
The body makes some choline, but the majority comes from dietary sources.
Researchers found that consuming the nutrient in high concentrations could lead to cause clotting, however.
They suggested that bacteria in the intestines could interact with choline to produce a compound that encourages blood platelets to clump together, thereby forming a blood clot.
The team observed by interacting with gut bacteria, choline produced a substance called TMAO.
The substance, which stands for trimethylamine N-oxide, is produced when the gut bacteria break down a number of dietary nutrients.
For their interventional study, the researchers provided oral choline supplements to healthy vegetarians and omnivores.
Both groups showed a 10-fold increase in plasma levels of TMAO after choline supplementation.
They also observed an increase in platelet responsiveness, a risk factor for thrombotic events.
According to the study’s lead author, the substance has been linked to an increased risk of blood clots, heart attack and stroke in previous studies.
High levels of the substance in the blood has been associated to an increased risk of cardiovascular illness.
While the risk of blood clotting increased in humans, this could be minimised by consuming low-dose aspirin, said the researchers.
While the drug was successful in lowering the risk of clumping, however, it did not eliminate the risk completely.
It is worth noting that concentrations of choline found in food are generally safe, but consuming supplements with choline could pose health risks.
The study researchers doctor Stanley L. Hazen of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, said: “Unless prescribed by your doctor, avoid supplements with choline.”
Other dietary habits that may increase the risk of blood clotting include dehydration, as this causes thickening of the blood.
When the body is deprived of fluids, the blood vessels can narrow as well, another known risk factor for clotting."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_887280,"(Natural News) CLAIM: The popular Tractor Supply chain of farm stores has reportedly reformulated its “Producer’s Pride” chicken feed, causing hens that eat it to no longer produce eggs.
Multiple online sources, many of them hen farmers, say that ever since Tractor Supply changed the Producer’s Pride formulation, their birds have gone desolate. This could be because of a reduction in the amount of protein contained in the feed, or it could be caused by other factors such as aflatoxin contamination.
Note: Mike Adams has committed to acquiring and testing Tractor Supply chicken feed products in his food science lab and sharing the results publicly, whatever they show. Tests to be conducted will include aflatoxins, heavy metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, zinc, copper, strontium, etc.), glyphosate and a full slate of microbiology including e.coli, salmonella, yeast and mold.
It is wintertime, which means birds are exposed to less sunlight and thus naturally produce fewer eggs. However, farmers say the drop-off in egg production is so dramatic this year that many hens are producing no eggs at all, as opposed to just a reduction in eggs.
All of this is happening at a time when inflation is off the charts and eggs are in short supply supposedly due to “avian flu”. (Related: There probably isn’t a real avian flu crisis like the media and the Biden regime are claiming, though, since the U.S. government is using fraudulent PCR tests to diagnose hens before slaughtering them.)
Egg prices have increased from an average of $1.71 per dozen 18 months ago to more than $7 a dozen today. This, coupled with the avian flu psy-op and now the Tractor Supply “Feedgate” issue, has created an egg crisis with no end in sight.

Has Tractor Supply been infiltrated with genocidal globalists who want to take away our eggs along with our meat?

There is also talk — although unproven — that Tractor Supply may have tampered with its Producer’s Pride formulation to deliberately cause an egg-laying crisis. Its board of directors is composed of 10 people, some of whom are tied to globalist entities like the World Economic Forum (WEF).
Joy Brown, a former executive at Vanguard, a $5 trillion index fund, is one of them. Vanguard is one of the “big three” index funds – BlackRock and State Street are the other two – boasting major financial support from the WEF and possibly even the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in China.
Andre Hawaux, another Tractor Supply board member, is a former ConAgra executive. ConAgra, as you may recall, is a heavy proponent of genetic engineering (GMO) that one Wyoming farmer told the independent media is comprised of “a bunch of crooks.”
ConAgra is one of the GMO top dogs that produces “terminator” seeds that eventually go sterile – and that also cause the soil they are planted in to go sterile. The gene-splicing technologies employed by ConAgra are “bad for both plants and humans,” this same farmer confirmed.
Then we have Mark Weikel, another Tractor Supply board member who worked as president of Victoria’s Secret, owned by Leslie Wexner, from 2003-2007. During that particular time period, pedophile pervert Jeffrey Epstein had a power-of-attorney document in his possession that allowed him to hire, manage, and fire all of Wexner’s employees and take control over the company’s finances and entities.
The Gateway Pundit reportedly asked Weikel point blank if he reported directly to Epstein during his time at Victoria’s Secret. He did not reply, nor did he deny, that this was the case.
“You know darn well that this is intentional,” one commenter wrote about Tractor Supply’s Feedgate.
“Satan walks among us,” wrote another. “Our food is next. They have already been doing evil things but now it will intensify.”
“When looking at this board of directors, there’s no question they messed with the chicken feed,” added someone else to the conversation.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_665786,"New data shows that 100% of COVID deaths in Canada are being caused by the mRNA vaccines that were forced on the population by the Trudeau regime and Big Pharma.
Covid deaths in Canada doubled in 2022 with a 85% vaccinated population.
Health Canada reports Covid deaths week-by-week, starting from the beginning of the pandemic in 2020.
In 2020, the total Covid deaths reported to the Public Health Agency Canada by provinces and territories was 9,225.
In 2021, as vaccines became accessible to Canadians between January and July, Covid deaths didn’t decrease over the year. Instead, the figure slightly increased to 9,934.
And, in 2022, with an approximately 85% vaccinated population in January and a less deadly Covid variant dominant, Covid deaths increased again.
Over 2022, Health Canada data shows 15,844 deaths occurred due to Covid – almost double the number of deaths in 2020 when citizens were “unprotected.”

Over half of these reported deaths between 2020 and 2022 were among Canadians aged 80 years and older.
Health Canada no longer provides data on death by vaccination status. As such, there’s no way to decipher which deaths in 2022 were among vaccinated populations and which were among unvaccinated.
The health agency does show overall death percentages by vaccine status from the start of the vaccine rollout in December 2020. This data reveals that just over half of all Covid deaths took place among those who received at least one Covid vaccine.
Legacy media created hysteria around the Delta variant in 2021, as the just-vaccinated population was learning they were not immune from getting infected with – or dying from – Covid.
Data suggested that the Delta variant was more contagious than the previously dominant Alpha, but less deadly. Furthermore, research indicates the Omicron variant – which became dominant in 2022 – is even less lethal than the Delta.
As previously reported by The Counter Signal, Canada’s 2022 excess deaths trajectory is on pace to shatter the total from 2021 – and obliterate that from 2020.
Excess deaths is the term that indicates whether a region had more or fewer deaths than expected, given demographics and historical trends. The figure helps calculate the true impact of a health crisis.
Health Canada data indicates 13,940 excess deaths took place in 2022 up to August 27.
By this same period in 2021, the total excess deaths was 10,406. In 2020, the total was 8,057.
In other words, as the percentage of Canadians “vaccinated” against Covid increased, so too did the excess death total and the Covid deaths."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_4539,"Board-certified pathologist Dr. Ryan Cole believes that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines are linked to rising cancer rates.
The owner of Idaho-based medical laboratory Cole Diagnostics cited a January 2018 paper published in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery to bolster his claim. The paper, written by researchers from Duke University and  the University of Pennsylvania, warned of a ""possible concern"" with mRNA vaccines – including the ones for COVID-19.

""Some mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation, but also potentially with autoimmunity. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to take,"" the paper stated.

Cole also cited animal trials for mRNA vaccines as evidence of their dangers. Test subjects developed ""odd cancers"" and ""autoimmune diseases"" up to a year after they were injected, he added.

Moreover, the pathologist's direct clinical experience also lent credence to his argument. According to Cole, he saw a dramatic increase in the number of people coming into his practice with gynecological cancers. The number of endometrial cancers he encountered rose by 20 times compared to what he typically sees on an annual basis. (Related: Mass COVID-19 vaccination is a deadly and unscientific policy that will cause surge in cancer rates, warns pathologist.)

Given this, Cole interpreted this increase in cancers and autoimmune problems as caused by the COVID-19 vaccines damaging the immune system.

Back in July 2021, the Idaho pathologist revealed that the COVID-19 vaccines causes catastrophic damage to human organs. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein used as the main component in the vaccines was responsible for this vaccine damage, he said.

""The spike protein doesn't just stay in the deltoid. [It] circulates in [the] blood and lands in multiple organs in the body,"" Cole said during the July 2021 White Coat Summit organized by America's Frontline Doctors.

Spike protein in COVID shot driving force behind cancer

Cole explained how the vaccines compromise the immune system during a January 2022 interview with Veronika Kyrylenko of the New American. He reiterated that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein used in the shot attacks receptors in the human cells that identify healthy cells from disease-causing ones.

According to the Idaho doctor, he initially saw viral skin lesions – commonly found in children – developing in his adult patients. Following many biopsies, he noticed an upward trend in women's cancers, including endometrial and cervical cancers, among older individuals.

""After I reported those, I had tons of oncologists coming forward and saying 'Yeah, I’m seeing the weird cancers – [those] we've been able to keep in check and treat – taking off like wildfire,"" he told Kyrylenko. ""That's because of the immune dysregulation that these shots cause.""

Cole pointed out that the COVID-19 vaccines turn off some of the toll-like receptors (TLRs) in human cells, compromising the immune system's alert mechanism. The deactivated receptors include TLR7 and TLR8, which detect viruses, and TLR3 and TLR4, which keep cancer in check.

The spike protein also binds to different genes, including the P53 gene that suppresses tumors; the TMPRSS-2 gene linked to prostate cancer; and the BRCA genes linked to breast cancer in women.

""We're giving a shot that makes a spike protein. That's a toxin that triggers cancer genes in bad ways and turns off other pattern receptors,"" said Cole. ""[It] causes the same disease as the virus and is predisposing people to auto-immune attacks and potentially short-term cancer risks.""

""We don’t know how long the immune system is suppressed after these shots and how long these receptors are shut off – because those studies aren't done,"" he concluded.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_320816,"Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel has been caught admitting to his friends at the World Economic Forum that his company produced 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine doses in 2019 – before the pandemic started.

While that revelation was shocking enough, Bancel was just getting started.

In the revealing footage from the World Economic Forum, Bancel also let slip that he had foreknowledge of a little something called the Covid pandemic. Make no mistake, this is proof, from the horse’s mouth, that Moderna and the Big Pharma cartel were complicit in planning the pandemic so they could push the global elite’s depopulation drug on the masses.

According to Bancel, he shocked his staff in 2019 by telling them that production of the mystery vaccine they had been working on would need to increase to a billion doses in the next year because, and I quote, “there is going to be a pandemic.”

Watch:

Increasing production from 100,000 to a billion was one hell of a bet from the Moderna CEO. But then, it’s always a good bet when you know what’s going to happen.

While Pfizer has been hogging the limelight of late, thanks to the undercover journalism of Project Veritas, the story of Moderna and their Covid response is actually far more revealing about the real origins of Covid-19.

Conclusive evidence that we have not been told the truth about the origins of Covid emerged when scientists found genetic material patented by Moderna in 2016 in the virus’s spike protein.

The team of international researchers identified a tiny snippet of code in the Covid virus that is identical to part of a gene patented by Moderna a whole three years before the pandemic began. 

According to researchers, there is a one-in-three-trillion chance of this “coincidence” occurring naturally.

The Moderna-patented genetic code was discovered in SARS-CoV-2’s unique furin cleavage site, the part that makes it so effective at infecting people and separates it from other coronaviruses.

Records show Moderna filed the patent for the genetic code in February 2016, years before Covid-19 was discovered, as part of its cancer research division.

Stéphane Bancel squirmed like a rat when he was put on the spot on Fox Business and asked to explain why genetic material patented by Moderna in 2016 is present in the Covid-19 virus’s spike protein.

Fox host Maria Bartiromo asked Bancel to explain how “a tiny chunk of DNA that matches sequence patended by Moderna three years before the pandemic began?“

Listen carefully to Bancel’s answer. Or should I say non-answer. He simply has no possible excuse for why his company patented a tiny chunk of genetic code later found in a virus that supposedly did not exist in 2016.

You can clearly see that Maria Bartiromo knows something is wrong, very wrong, with this information, but she isn’t quite willing to swallow the red pill.

Which is understandable, because it would be a life changing decision for her. It would certainly spell the end of her career in mainstream media, for one.

But for anybody who isn’t controlled by a mainstream media corporation, the decision is obvious. You can take the blue pill, and attempt to convince yourself that it’s just a massive coincidence, a one-in-three-trillion coincidence, and go on with your life, living in blissful ignorance.

Or you can take the red pill and accept that they were prepared for the pandemic with their mRNA vaccine technology in advance… and that they knew the effect their vaccines would have on humanity.

For the record, numerous studies have shown a clear link between Moderna’s Covid vaccine and the litany of heart-related complications that are on the increase around the world. Young and healthy people are suddenly dying of heart-related causes at an unprecedented rate.

Which makes it very interesting that Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel told Sky News Business Australia about his new mRNA injectable that will “grow back new blood vessels and revascularize the heart.”

Describing the mRNA injections as “therapy” and “science fiction medicine,” Bancel touted the developments as “super exciting,” before acknowledging the jab will “inject mRNA in people’s heart[s].”

Oh gee, what could possibly go wrong?

As the interviewer pointed out, it is worth keeping in mind that Moderna did not have a single product bought to market before the elites gave them free reign with the Covid-19 vaccine. All of their previous products were deemed too dangerous for human trials.

Which makes some of Bill Gates’ recent statements even more disturbing. According to Gates, who was interviewed on British TV, normal human safety trials were compromised.

These really are experimental vaccines, folks.

But should we really be surprised? After all, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who also made an absolute fortune out of the pandemic, also seemed to know all the details in advance, including the timeline.

They were all in on the greatest crime against humanity we have ever seen. There is more than enough evidence out there. People just would prefer not to see. They are choosing to take the blue pill. But more and more people are beginning to wake up as the evidence becomes overwhelming.

News Analysis
The Biden administration is preparing to sign up the United States to a “legally binding” accord with the World Health Organization (WHO) that experts say would give the Geneva-based United Nations health agency the authority to dictate America’s policies during a pandemic.

Despite widespread criticism of the WHO’s response to the COVID pandemic, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra joined with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in September 2022 to announce “the U.S.-WHO Strategic Dialogue.” Together, they developed a “platform to maximize the longstanding U.S.–WHO partnership, and to protect and promote the health of all people around the globe, including the American people.”

These discussions and others spawned the “zero draft” (pdf) of a pandemic treaty, published on Feb. 1, which now seeks ratification by all 194 WHO member states. A meeting of the WHO’s Intergovernmental Negotiating Body is scheduled for Feb. 27 to work out the final terms, which members will then sign.
Written under the banner of “the world together equitably,” the zero draft grants the WHO the power to declare and manage a global pandemic emergency. Once a health emergency is declared, all signatories, including the United States, would submit to the authority of the WHO regarding treatments, government regulations such as lockdowns and vaccine mandates, global supply chains, and monitoring and surveillance of populations.
The question of whether an international treaty has the power to dictate domestic policy without lawmakers’ approval is a contentious one. “Treaties don’t override our Constitution,” wrote Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) on Twitter on Feb. 27.

“If a treaty purports to supersede our Constitution, that treaty is unenforceable,” Massie wrote.

Centralized Pandemic Response
But others are wary of international agreements that could centralize authority or the response to pandemics.
“They want to see a centralized, vaccine-and-medication-based response, and a very restrictive response in terms of controlling populations,” David Bell, a public health physician and former WHO staffer specializing in epidemic policy, told The Epoch Times. “They get to decide what is a health emergency, and they are putting in place a surveillance mechanism that will ensure that there are potential emergencies to declare.”

The WHO pandemic treaty is part of a two-track effort, coinciding with an initiative by the World Health Assembly to create new global pandemic regulations that experts fear would also supersede the laws of member states. The World Health Assembly is the rule-making body of the WHO, comprised of representatives from the member states.

“Both [initiatives] are fatally dangerous,” Francis Boyle, professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law, told The Epoch Times. “Either one or both would set up a worldwide medical police state under the control of the WHO, and in particular WHO Director-General Tedros.

“If either one or both of these go through, Tedros or his successor will be able to issue orders that will go all the way down the pipe to your primary care physicians.”

Physician Meryl Nass told The Epoch Times: “If these rules go through as currently drafted, I, as a doctor, will be told what I am allowed to give a patient and what I am prohibited from giving a patient, whenever the WHO declares a public health emergency. So they can tell you you’re getting remdesivir, but you can’t have hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin. What they’re also saying is they believe in equity, which means everybody in the world gets vaccinated, whether or not you need it, whether or not you’re already immune.”

Regarding medical treatments, the accord would require member nations to “monitor and regulate against substandard and falsified pandemic-related products.” Based on previous WHO and Biden administration policy, this would likely include forcing populations to take newly developed vaccines, while preventing doctors from prescribing nonvaccine treatments or medicines.
Circumventing Senate, Constitution?
A key question surrounding the accord is whether the Biden administration can bind the United States to treaties and agreements without Senate consent, which is required under the Constitution. The zero draft concedes that, per international law, treaties between countries must be ratified by national legislatures, thus respecting the right of their citizens to consent.
However, the draft also includes a clause that the accord will go into effect on a “provisional” basis as soon as it’s signed by delegates to the WHO and would, therefore, be legally binding on members without being ratified by legislatures.

“Whoever drafted this clause knew as much about U.S. constitutional law and international law as I did, and deliberately drafted it to circumvent the power of the Senate to give its advice and consent to treaties, to provisionally bring it into force immediately upon signature,” Boyle said. In addition, “the Biden administration will take the position that this is an international executive agreement that the president can conclude of his own accord without approval by Congress and is binding on the United States of America, including all state and local democratically elected officials, governors, attorney generals, and health officials.”

There are several U.S. Supreme Court decisions that may support the Biden administration’s position, according to Boyle. They include State of Missouri v. Holland, in which the Supreme Court ruled that treaties supersede state laws, while other decisions, such as United States v. Belmont, ruled that executive agreements without Senate consent can be legally binding, with the force of treaties.
There are parallels between the WHO pandemic accord and a recent Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) global tax agreement, which the Biden administration signed on to, although Republicans say has “no path forward” to legislative approval. In the OECD agreement, punitive terms are built in that allow foreign countries to punish American companies if the deal isn’t ratified by the United States.
As with the OECD tax agreement, administration officials are attempting to appeal to international organizations to impose policies that have been rejected by America’s voters. Under the U.S. Constitution, health care doesn’t fall under the authority of the federal government; it’s the domain of the states. The Biden administration found this to be an unwelcome impediment to its attempts to impose vaccine and mask mandates on Americans when courts ruled that federal agencies didn’t have the authority to do so, according to Boyle.

“To circumvent that, they went to the WHO, for either the regulations or the treaty, to get around domestic opposition,” Boyle said.

According to the zero draft, signatories would agree to “strengthen the capacity and performance of national regulatory authorities and increase the harmonization of regulatory requirements at the international and regional level.” They will also implement a “whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach at the national level” that will include national governments, local governments, and private companies.

The zero draft stated that the new accord is necessary because of “the catastrophic failure of the international community in showing solidarity and equity in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.”

A report from the WHO’s Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (pdf) characterized the WHO’s performance as a “toxic cocktail” of bad decisions. Co-Chair Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told the BBC it was due to “a myriad of failures, gaps, and delays.” The solutions proposed by that report, however, didn’t suggest more local autonomy or diversified decision-making, but rather greater centralization, more power, and more money for the WHO.
‘One Health Surveillance’ and Misinformation
The WHO pandemic agreement calls for member states to implement “One Health surveillance.” One Health is a concept that has been embraced by the United Nations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Bank, and other global organizations.
“The term originally meant a way of seeing human and animal health as linked—they sometimes are—so that you could improve human health by acting more broadly,” Bell said. “It has become hijacked and now is used to claim that all human activities, and all issues within the biosphere, affect health, and are therefore within Public Health’s remit. So public health can be deemed to include climate, or racism, or fisheries management, and this is being used to claim that addressing carbon emissions is a health issue and therefore a health ‘emergency.’”

The WHO zero draft states that “‘One Health surveillance’ means ...” leaving the definition to be worked out in future drafts. Whatever One Health surveillance ultimately entails, however, the signatories must invest in it, implement it, and “strengthen” it. In September 2022, the World Bank approved a Financial Intermediary Fund to finance, among other things, One Health surveillance.
Signatories also agree to support the official narrative when it comes to information about a pandemic. Specifically, they will “conduct regular social listening and analysis to identify the prevalence and profiles of misinformation” and “design communications and messaging strategies for the public to counteract misinformation, disinformation and false news, thereby strengthening public trust.”

This aligns with efforts by the Biden administration to, as former White House press secretary Jennifer Psaki put it, “make sure social media companies are aware of the latest narratives dangerous to public health ... and engage with them to better understand the enforcement of social media platform policies.” Meanwhile, U.N. Undersecretary-General Melissa Fleming stated at a 2022 World Economic Forum panel in Davos, Switzerland, on “Tackling Disinformation,” “We own the science and we think that the world should know it.”
The official narrative during the COVID pandemic included support for lockdowns, school closures, and masking—all of which have since proven to be ineffective in stopping the spread of the virus and damaging to public health. A group of more than 900,000 doctors, epidemiologists, and public health scientists jointly signed the Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, expressing “grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies.” This declaration was widely derided as dangerous misinformation and was censored on social media.
“The views that they crushed were orthodox public health,” Bell said. Until 2019, public health guidelines “specifically said that things like prolonged border closures, closing stores, etc. were harmful, particularly for low-income people, and shouldn’t be done beyond a few weeks.”

Those who pushed for lockdowns “were very clear that what they were recommending for COVID was going to be extremely harmful, and that the harm would outweigh the benefit,” Bell said. “They were clear because they wrote that down before, and there’s nothing new in the idea that impoverishing people reduces life expectancy. Something dramatically changed their minds, and that something wasn’t evidence, so we can only assume that it was pressure from vested interests.”

In January, a survey presented at the World Economic Forum found that public trust in government has plummeted since the start of the pandemic, though attendees were at a loss to explain the reasons for the decline in trust. Instead, the discussion at the panel, titled “Disrupting Distrust,” focused on combating rogue news sources that challenged the central narrative.
U.S. Membership in the WHO
In July 2020, then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from membership in the WHO. Citing the health agency’s dismal performance in responding to the COVID pandemic and its ties to the Chinese Communist Party, Trump said that U.S. funding of about a half-billion dollars per year would also cease.
In response, then-presidential-candidate Joe Biden vowed, “On my first day as President, I will rejoin the WHO and restore our leadership on the world stage.” Biden kept his promise and took it one step further, negotiating the pandemic accord.

Today, GOP lawmakers are attempting to revive the effort to take the United States out of the WHO. On Jan. 12, House Republicans introduced the “No Taxpayer Funding for the World Health Organization Act,” which was sponsored by 16 representatives.

“Funneling millions of taxpayer dollars to the corrupt World Health Organization that serves the Chinese Communist Party is a slap in the face to hardworking American families struggling under record high inflation, and to all those whose lives and livelihoods were ruined and destroyed by the COVID pandemic."" Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), the proposal’s lead sponsor, stated.

“The WHO ... praised China for their ‘leadership’ at the beginning of COVID-19 and has done nothing to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for the spread of COVID-19.”

The pandemic accord, a spokesman for Roy told The Epoch Times, “is just another reason to defund the WHO.”
Redefining Sovereignty and Human Rights
The zero draft of the accord states that national sovereignty remains a priority, but within limits.
“States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to determine and manage their approach to public health,” the draft declares, “provided that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to their peoples and other countries.”

The accord states that human rights are also important, and it mandates that “people living under any restrictions on the freedom of movement, such as quarantines and isolations, have sufficient access to medication, health services and other necessities and rights.” The accord presents human rights as “health equity, through resolute action on social, environmental, cultural, political and economic determinants of health.”

In line with that concept, countries such as Austria went so far as to criminalize the refusal to take the COVID vaccine. Within the United States, places that included New York City mandated vaccine passports for access to public spaces, dividing its residents into a privileged vaccinated class and a second-tier unvaccinated class.

However, others see human rights not in terms of collective health but rather as individual rights, including such things as personal sovereignty, the ability of individuals to make their own choices, the right of people to have a voice in medical decisions that affect them, free speech, and freedom of movement and assembly.

Following World War II and the state-control ideologies of fascism, national socialism, and communism, “it was realized that there has to be a fundamental understanding that individuals are sovereign,” Bell said. Human rights declarations after the war emphasized that, even during times of crisis, “we are born with rights, we’re all equal, and those rights are inviolable. That is being very much watered down or wiped away in order to do this.”

“I think this issue is much, much broader; it’s what sort of society we want to live in. Do we believe in equality or do we believe in a feudal system where we have a few people at the top, controlling society, telling others what to do? That’s the direction we’re going in.”

Officials at the WHO, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the World Bank didn’t respond by press time to a request by The Epoch Times for comment.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_723169,"DeKalb County recently announced it had received a $2 million grant from the U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence.

After left-wing nonprofits poured tens of millions of dollars into their state during the 2020 election to change election operations to benefit Democrats, Georgia Republicans passed legislation in an attempt to prevent such malfeasance from happening again. Now, those same dark money groups are back to replicate their 2020 strategy for the 2024 contest and test the integrity of Georgia’s elections.
Earlier this month, DeKalb County, one of the state’s most populous localities and a Democrat stronghold, announced it had been selected to join the U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence and that the county’s commissioners had accepted a $2 million grant from the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL). Launched last year, the Alliance is an $80 million venture by left-wing nonprofits to “systematically influence every aspect of election administration” and advance Democrat-backed voting policies in local election offices.
Despite Georgia law (SB 202) prohibiting election superintendents or boards of registrars from directly accepting “funding, grants, or gifts” from private entities, DeKalb County election officials have found a way to skirt such provisions to acquire the Alliance’s funding.
In her remarks to Decaturish.com, a local Georgia news outlet, DeKalb Board of Registration and Elections Chair Dele Lowman Smith, a Democrat, admitted the application process for the Alliance grant was spearheaded by DeKalb’s finance department instead of the board of elections. According to Lowman Smith, this was done “since election offices are not allowed to receive grants directly.”
A copy of DeKalb’s Alliance grant application obtained by The Federalist confirms the county’s finance department spearheaded efforts to acquire the grant.
“In [Lowman Smith’s] own words, she’s acknowledging that they’re going to violate the spirit of SB 202,” Marci McCarthy, who serves as chair of the DeKalb County Republican Party, told The Federalist. “They’re bypassing an open bids process. So, if I have a similar set of services or goods to offer [DeKalb’s election office] as a business owner … [I would have] no opportunity to participate in the bidding process.”
During the 2020 election, groups like CTCL received hundreds of millions of dollars from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. These “Zuckbucks” were poured into local election offices in battleground states around the country to change how elections were administered, such as by expanding unsecure election protocols like mail-in voting and the use of ballot drop boxes. To make matters worse, the grants were heavily skewed towards Democrat-majority counties, essentially making it a massive Democrat get-out-the-vote operation.
Much like what happened in 2020, the U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence — of which CTCL is a key partner — is attempting to replicate such a strategy ahead of the 2024 elections. In a recent report, the Honest Elections Project and the John Locke Foundation revealed how the Alliance seeks to skirt existing “Zuckbucks” bans or restrictions passed by 24 states by providing election offices “scholarships” to cover membership costs. These scholarships are then “instantly converted into ‘credits’ that member offices can use to buy services from CTCL and other Alliance partners.”
In an Alliance application, applicants are asked to fill out a series of questions, such as “How would you like to get involved [with the Alliance]?” and “How does your office currently learn from other election offices?” The more conspicuous aspect of the document, however, is the “Recommendations” section, where applicants are given the option to “nominate” other local election offices to become potential Alliance members. In DeKalb’s application — which was filed in May 2022 — the county’s deputy finance director, Preston Stephens, recommends Clayton County, a neighboring locality that Joe Biden won in 2020 by 70 points.
GOP Questions About DeKalb’s Alliance Application

DeKalb County officials’ willingness to violate the spirit of Georgia’s “Zuckbucks” ban isn’t just raising concerns among election integrity groups. In a series of emails provided to The Federalist by McCarthy, one of DeKalb’s Republican election board members, Nancy Jester, is documented seeking out the county’s Alliance grant application, indicating that Jester was never provided the document prior to the election board’s announcement of the award.
“Can you send me the grant application that DeKalb submitted for the grant that was discussed in our last Board meeting?” Jester wrote in a Feb. 6 email to Keisha Smith, the executive director of DeKalb’s election board. “I believe it’s the program called ‘U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence’ sponsored by the Center for Tech and Civic Life.”
In a follow-up email sent the next day, Jester asked Smith to provide her with the “last version” of the application she “or the election’s office saw or worked on regarding the grant that was eventually awarded.”
After receiving the requested document from Smith, Jester forwarded it to McCarthy on Feb. 9, noting how it “doesn’t look like an application.”
“It’s very strange to me,” Jester added.
Jester’s Republican colleague and fellow board member Anthony Lewis also appeared to have questions surrounding DeKalb’s grant application, asking Smith “for clarification of the grant application process” at the election board’s January meeting.
Neither Jester nor Lewis responded to The Federalist’s request for comment on how much information they were provided about DeKalb’s acceptance of the Alliance grant before it was announced to the public.
Legal Action Against DeKalb

In light of their bid to skirt Georgia’s “Zuckbucks” ban, DeKalb County officials are facing legal action over their decision to accept the $2 million grant from the Alliance.
Last week, the group known as Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections (RITE) filed a legal complaint against DeKalb County with Georgia’s state election board, arguing the county’s evasion of the provisions in SB 202 “undermines democratic self-governance as reflected in Georgia’s duly enacted laws and erodes public trust and confidence in our elections.”
“Notwithstanding that the law expressly prohibits the [DeKalb] County [Election] Board from accepting such funds from a private source, the County Board is proceeding forward under the pretense that the transactions were legal because the funds are not traveling directly from the Alliance to the County Board,” the complaint reads. “This is a cynical argument in service of a clear attempt to circumvent the General Assembly’s mandate. … It is patently unlawful, and it cannot be allowed to succeed.”
As a resolution, RITE is asking the state election board to use its subpoena power or authorize the Georgia secretary of state to investigate potential violations of state law. If such alleged violations are found, RITE further requests the board to “exercise its powers … to require [DeKalb County] and the [DeKalb Election] Board to immediately ‘cease and desist from committing further violations’ (which would include not spending the grant money and terminating the contract with CTCL) and impose appropriate sanctions.”
Solution to the Problem

According to McCarthy, the best solution to combat DeKalb’s acceptance of “Zuckbucks 2.0” is for the state legislature to pass legislation tightening the language of the provisions in SB 202.
“When you’re reading the law, you’re going to read the law as it’s specified. That’s what judges do,” McCarthy said. “The language needs to be amended to ensure that there’s not an ability [among counties] to accept any type of [private funding] from any source.”
While no Georgia Republican legislator has introduced a bill specifically addressing this issue, McCarthy told The Federalist that a Senate committee will hold a hearing on Thursday, where it is expected language closing the “Zuckbucks 2.0” loophole will be included in a proposed elections bill (SB 122).
If what happened in 2020 “happens again in 2024, shame on all of us for not paying attention and thinking this problem, this cancer, is just going to be wiped under the skin,” McCarthy said."

In a stunning move that has left the tech industry reeling, Elon Musk has announced that he plans to acquire Facebook in the near future.





Many are scratching their heads, wondering why the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX would want to take over a social media platform that has been plagued by scandal and controversy for years.
According to sources close to Musk, he sees Facebook as an untapped market for his futuristic ideas and grand plans for the future.
He believes that by acquiring the platform, he can revolutionize the way people communicate, share information, and connect with each other.
Of course, there are many who are skeptical of Musk’s intentions. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that he simply wants to use Facebook to promote his own companies and ideas, while silencing any dissenting voices.
But Musk is undeterred. In a recent interview, he stated that he believes Facebook is “a diamond in the rough” that simply needs a visionary leader to take it to the next level.
While it remains to be seen whether Musk’s acquisition of Facebook will be successful, one thing is certain: this is a move that will be watched closely by everyone in the tech industry.
If Musk can turn Facebook around and make it a force for good in the world, he will cement his legacy as one of the greatest innovators of our time.





But if he fails, he may just end up being remembered as the guy who tried to take over a sinking ship and went down with it. Only time will tell which scenario will play out, but one thing is for sure: Elon Musk is not one to shy away from a challenge."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_737906,"Bill Gates’ lab-grown meat causes cancer in humans who consume it, according to a disturbing new study.

Synthetic meat has been heavily promoted by Bill Gates and the globalist elites at the WEF as the solution to so-called climate change. However, this fake food has now been shown to cause cancer via the immortalized cell lines used to manufacture it.

Not content with poisoning your heart with mRNA vaccines while he sends grandma to a death panel for being useless, Gates wants you to sit down at the dinner table to his repulsive tasting synthetic meat, which just so happens to riddle you with incurable cancers.

But there is just one problem for Bill Gates and his globalist cronies. We are onto them. The people are waking up and thanks to people like yourself who are spreading the word regarding the real agenda of the elite, the globalist’s plans are starting to fall apart at the seams.

Please subscribe to our channel if you haven’t already and feel free to join the People’s Voice Locals Community for no-holds-barred uncensored videos and to join a community of people determined to hold the elite to account. The link is in the description box under this video. Here at the People’s Voice we are determined to continue exposing the crimes of the globalist elite – but we need you to join us in our mission.

Reporting on the globalist elite is a full time job because, as the Bible tells us, wicked doesn’t sleep. Take Bill Gates as a case in point. Rather than admitting that humanity has woken up to the truth about the disastrous experimental Covid-19 jabs, Gates, who is not a doctor or a dietician, is doubling down and taking it upon himself to force the Western world to disastrous, experimental synthetic meat.

The National Pulse shined a light on this issue in a February 17 piece, citing a Bloomberg story about Gates’ fake meat crusade. The February 7 piece by Joe Fassler explained why Bill Gates’ fake meat companies use immortalized cell lines for their products.

“Normal meat cells don’t just keep dividing forever. To get the cell cultures to grow at rates big enough to power a business, several companies … are quietly using what are called immortalized cells, something most people have never eaten intentionally,” Fassler wrote.

While immortalized cell lines “are a staple of medical research,” Fassler noted that these are technically pre-cancerous and can be fully cancerous at times.

“The problem is that the materials used to make the product – ‘immortalized cell lines’ – replicate forever, just like cancer. Which means, in effect, that they are cancer. Industry types are ‘confident’ that eating such products poses no risk. But it’s not difficult to see, even if the products are ‘proven’ safe, how people might be put off by the thought that they’re eating a glorified tumor.”

According to REN, the dangers of fake meat made using immortalized cell lines come from the fact that long-term safety data for its consumption are not yet available.

You shouldn’t be surprised. After all, it’s not the first time Gates has attempted to push an experimental product on the masses in order to generate enormous profits for himself and catastrophic results for the rest of humanity.

The Furin-Cleavage site gave the game away regarding the Covid vaccine’s real origins, with a sequence patented by Moderna three years before Covid was even a thing found in the virus’s DNA.

As for Gates’s fake meat, it is the immortalized cells that have exposed the elite’s agenda. Fassler pointed out that immortalized cells in these products can multiply aggressively and indefinitely if placed under the right conditions.

“This brings with it safety, but also image concerns,” he wrote.

To back up Fassler’s point, The National Pulse cited an instance where New York City Democrat Mayor Eric Adams – a vegan – attended a VIP event sponsored by cultured salmon manufacturer Wildtype. While several attendees enjoyed tasting the cultured salmon, Adams excused himself and left the event without taking a single bite of the fake fish.

Other ingredients in fake meat can also cause health issues

Aside from immortal cells in lab-grown meat being carcinogens, ingredients in these products that are meant to mimic the taste and texture of the real thing can also cause all manner of serious health issues.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s Children’s Health Defense reported on the issue in September 2022, focusing on the fake meat products from the California-based Impossible Foods.

The health freedom group cited a study conducted by the company involving rats fed with the Impossible Burger. The research was done under the assumption that fake meat products would have minimal impacts, if none at all. But the study’s findings came out very differently.

The study found that soy leghemoglobin (SLH) caused “inexplicable alterations within rat biology.” Rats fed SLH experienced unexplained weight gain and changes in blood indicating the onset of inflammation or kidney disease and possible signs of anemia. SLH, which is derived from genetically modified (GM) yeast, is responsible for giving the Impossible Burger its meaty taste and making it bleed like real meat when cut.

Another ingredient in the Impossible Burger that caused health issues is herbicide-tolerant soy protein (HTSP). Impossible Foods introduced HTSP to the burger recipe in 2019 to improve the product’s texture and avoid gluten, the wheat protein that some people are unable to tolerate. As a result, fake meat burgers can contain residues of the herbicide glyphosate sprayed on soybeans – which are then processed into HTSP.

Tests commissioned by the advocacy group Moms Across America confirmed this finding. Based on tests performed at the Iowa-based Health Research Institute Laboratories, Impossible Burgers had glyphosate levels of 11.3 parts per billion. This was 11 times higher than the glyphosate detected on the Beyond Meat Burger, which used plant-based ingredients that did not undergo genetic modification.

Why are the elite so determined to poison us? Could it have anything to do with the depopulation agenda the elites at the WEF are becoming more and more comfortable speaking about?

Gates is also becoming increasingly arrogant and no longer feels any shame whatsoever about openly broadcasting his real intentions for the human race.

Gates, who was divorced by his wife due to his close relationship with deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, visited the University of Edinburgh‘s Langhill Farm to launch the school’s Global Academy of Agriculture and Food Security.

Rather than beating around the bush and obfuscating, as he used to do before the Covid pandemic, Gates appeared comfortable bragging about pumping mRNA vaccines into farm animals destined for dinner plates to “force jab” the unvaccinated.

Unless all animals, including food animals, are jabbed with Big Pharma’s latest poisons, the food supply will remain “dirty,” in Gates’ view. Only he and his globalist minions can “sanitize” nature with new chemicals and DNA modification techniques – which they are also trying to do to humans.

As he usually does, Gates started all this by playing God with the lives of other people, experimenting on the third world, which he views as his personal fiefdom.

According to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., anyone who is prepared to allow Bill Gates to dictate world and US health policy should take a long, hard look at his record in Africa.

“Perhaps millions of children have died unnecessarily,” according Kennedy Jr., who shared information from a peer-reviewed publication in a respected journal.

“Anyone defending Bill Gates & WHO needs to explain Morgensen et al 2017.“

“This is a peer-reviewed publication in a respected journal by leading scientists describing outcomes akin to genocide,” said Kennedy Jr.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also slammed Gates and his “messianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology.” 

“Vaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feed his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft’s ambition to control a global vac ID enterprise) and give him dictatorial control over global health policy—the spear tip of corporate neo-imperialism,” Kennedy Jr. wrote.

“Gates’ obsession with vaccines seems fueled by a messianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology and a god-like willingness to experiment with the lives of lesser humans.”

The global elite, led by figures such as Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, are like cartoon villains at this point. Except that they’re real and incredibly dangerous.

RESIGN
He needs to resign for the good of the country.
His fellow democrats should encourage him to resign if they care about his health and if they care about America.
I think most people reading this would agree that John Fetterman never should have been in the general election.
I am not bashing Fetterman for having a stroke, quite the opposite, actually.
Because he had a stroke, I believe he needed time to recover, not the stress of running for office.
Fetterman is unfit for the job
I’m not saying that to be cruel.
It’s just the fact.
When a person experiences a stroke the are many effects that take its toll on the brain and the body.
He needed rest and medical care and certainly didn’t need the stress that comes with running an election.
I mean, the dude can’t even finish a sentence much like Biden.
As it sits, he fits in perfectly with the democrat party.
At this point and probably forever he will be useless when it comes to politics.

I have never hidden the fact that I do not like Fetterman, but this has nothing at all to do with that.
After Fetterman’s stroke, Democrats should have put someone else in the primary.
Now, in addition to the problems from his stroke, he is being treated for depression, yet Democrats are still supporting him remaining in office.
Rather than calling for his resignation, the PA governor is supporting Fetterman remaining in office.
Governor Shapiro stated, “He’s going to get the help that he needs.
“John Fetterman will do a great job for the people of Pennsylvania as their senator for a long time.”
Dems really don’t give a crap about his health
Exactly how can he represent the people of Pennsylvania when he is holed up in a hospital, probably heavily medicated, for depression?
Just let that man heal and appoint someone to replace him or hold a special election.
Seriously, if these filthy democrats had a heart they would prioritize Fetterman’s health, his problems with depression and his recovery.
But it’s quite obvious that all they care about is that seat.
They don’t give a crap about him.
I care more about him than they do and I don’t even like the dude- he’s a dem.
Who knows, maybe when he’s recovered he will realize what scumbags democrats are and he’ll vote against their crappy agenda and vote with Republicans!
If that happened the dems would dump that dude faster than you can say HUNTER’S A CRACKHEAD!
We wish the best for Fetterman and hope he has a successful recovery.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_223607,"As you are no doubt aware, the global elite are making moves to have people “own nothing and be happy.” The world will be controlled by an authoritarian one-world government and humanity, according to Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum, will be enslaved in a totalitarian system featuring mass surveillance, mandatory vaccinations and desperate servitude.

It wouldn’t be so bad if the WEF wasn’t so influential. Klaus Schwab has openly bragged about his organization’s ability to infiltrate governments across the globe. At the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, he discussed how the WEF’s modus operandi is to penetrate governments by installing its “Young Global Leaders.”

In recent years, we have seen this modus operandi play out. The WEF has infiltrated governments across the world, with every left-voting nation firmly under their control. Make no mistake, these Young Global Leaders, including Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron, are working hand-in-glove with Davos to roll out the globalist agenda of the elite.

Now, in a disturbing development, the globalist elite are claiming that water is not a human right and the world’s water supplies must be privatized and controlled by the elites.

The World Economic Forum is teaming up with the UN to set its sights on seizing control of the world’s water supplies and holding humanity to ransom.

Before we dive in, subscribe to the channel if you haven’t already, and join The People’s Voice Locals community for exclusive and uncensored content.

The World Economic Forum and the U.N. have ordered world governments to prepare to ration people’s water supply as part of their ‘Great Reset’ agenda for humanity.

The globalist organizations are hosting a conference on water in New York as part of the U.N. quest to accomplish its 17 sustainable development goals, a list that if fully achieved and enacted, will give the globalist elites total control over all human activities.

“[T]he conference aims to raise awareness of the global water crisis and decide on action to achieve internationally agreed water-related goals,” the World Economic Forum wrote in a recent post.

“The Global Commission on the Economics of Water, launched at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in 2022, will report on game-changing ways to value and manage water as a common good,” the World Economic Forum wrote in this same recent post.

Just as the Paris Agreement promised an end to pollution — if only humans would stop taking airplanes and driving cars and heating their homes and using gas stoves — now this blossoming water treaty will no doubt promise an end to thirst. Yes, an end to thirst — so long as humans of the world unite and abide by all the coming WEF water dictates.

The United Nations plans to protect water that’s used for bathing; water that’s used for developments; water that’s home to sea life; water that’s used for transportation. So the up-and-coming controls would likely focus on residential limits to water usage, and costly increases to access that water; on bans on agricultural usage, and costly increases on farmers; on strict controls on the types and numbers of ships that can sail the seas and rivers and channels, and costly increases for this form of transportation.

Then will come the offset demands — as with carbon offsets, the WEF water czars will demands trades of activities to offset the supposed pollution of the waterways.

So much for jet skiing. So much for fishing on the weekends with the family. It’ll be too expensive — and regulated.

“Natural resources crises, including for water and food, come within the top 10 biggest risks facing humanity in the coming decade,” the World Economic Forum wrote.

The hysteria’s in place. The hysterical claims are heating up the media. 

“[A]s global warming continues to take effect, ordinary weather is becoming a thing of the past, exacerbating our water crisis,” the World Economic Forum wrote.

There you have it.

The double-whammy of climate alarmism and a water crisis: Let the fear go forth.

“It’s clear that we need to rethink our approach to how we can best allocate and value water,” the World Economic Forum wrote. “How can we share the cost of preventing or mitigating droughts and floods exacerbated by global warming?”

It’s a question the global bureaucrats want to be answered this way: by turning over all human activity to the control of the United Nations and its select partners in global politics.

This is where this water conference is leading. The globalists won’t quit until they grab all power from all people across all the nations — even if they have to do it one drop at a time.

The elites have long set their sights on seizing control of the water supply.

Nestle CEO Peter Brabeck-Letmathe admitted as much during a shocking interview during which he inadvertently exposed the psychopathic mindset of the elite.

At a time when inflation has gone double-digit, food production plants are burning down, the supply chain is in crisis, and food shortages are on the horizon, we now understand that the elites are making moves behind the scenes to seize control of the planet’s water.

So, is water a free and basic human right, or should all the water on the planet belong to major corporations and the elite?

Should the poor who cannot afford to pay these so-called “water offsets” be forced to allow the state to euthanize them because of their lack of financial wealth?

That is the future of humanity according to the global elites.

You might remember the Oregon ‘Rain Man’ or Gary Harrington — who was sentenced to 30 days in Jackson County Jail in 2015 and slapped with a $1,500 fine for the crime of collecting rainwater on his 170-acre property?

He was ordered to breach his dams and drain his ponds that held more than 13 million gallons of water, enough to fill 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

He’s got a message for us all about the government and the globalist elite and their plans for seizing control of the world’s water.

“The government is bullying,” Harrington said in an interview.

“They’ve just gotten to be big bullies and if you just lay over and die and give up, that just makes them bigger bullies. So, we as Americans, we need to stand on our constitutional rights, on our rights as citizens and hang tough. This is a good country, we’ll prevail,” he said.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_528348,"You can’t even trust buying organic produce anymore, thanks to The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Katy Perry and Oprah. There’s a new label on your produce, and it’s anything but ap”peel”ing. Apeel is a “plant-based protection that helps the produce you love stay fresh for longer”… or, in other words, a chemical coating put on your produce which you can’t wash off so it doesn’t brown or decompose in a normal amount of time. Exactly how old is that avocado

Unfortunately, if you think by choosing organic you’re good to go… think again. On their website they state, “We have formulations that are OMRI Listed® for the growers and distributors of USDA Certified Organic produce.” They say that it helps reduce plastic, which might be true… but what exactly is this coating made of? They state on their FAQs that there is only one ingredient, but then go on to say that it’s only composed of food-grade (multiple) ingredients made from “plant materials”.

Apeel brags about its purified mono-and diglycerides, a food ingredient that is found in a variety of foods. According to Dr. Josh Axe, mono-and diglycerides are “the go-to replacement for deadly trans fats and a food industry staple that helps keep oil and fat from separating. (Vani) Hari (The Food Babe) explains that this additive is a byproduct of oil processing, including partially hydrogenated canola and soybean oils. This additive is a byproduct of oil processing which contains artificial trans fat – a danger food ingredient known to cause coronary heart disease and linked to 50,000 fatal heart attacks a year.” (Side note: The FDA finally determined that trans fats are no longer generally recognized as safe for food use in 2016 and yet mono-and diglycerides are the “the go-to replacement.” But they change the label from trans fats to mono-and diglycerides and then the FDA changes their tune. Interesting or predictable?)

If you’re thinking that you’ll just wash it off, well, I hate to break it you, but you can’t. In their FAQs they essentially say that you can try but won’t succeed. “You could likely remove some of Apeel with water and scrubbing, but it's unlikely that you'd be able to remove all of it without damaging the fruit or vegetable. Apeel forms a barrier of edible material on the skin or peel, and it wouldn't maintain the fruit's natural freshness if it was easily removed.” Lovely.

When asked if Apeel is a chemical, Jenny Du, the co-founder states, “Well, everything is in fact a chemical”… way to skirt the question there, Jenny! She goes on to say, “We’re all part of ‘star-stuff’… which are elements that surround us to form chemicals…” blah blah blah skirt skirt skirt. But also, speaking of chemicals, if this mono-and diglycerides is plant derived, I’d like to know what plant it’s derived from AND what that plant was treated with. What chemicals, pesticides and more were used on that plant? They wont tell us because, remember, Jenny Du says that, “everything is a chemical.” (I wish you could see how many times I’ve rolled my eyes already while writing and researching this!) Watch Jenny’s video below and more importantly check the comments section.

“It’s safe,” says the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Canada… so safe that it’s in products designed for even infants and the elderly, the world’s most sensitive people.  “Specifically, mono- and diglycerides can be found in products such as Similac Pro- Advance® Infant Formula and Ensure® Enlive® Advanced Therapeutic Nutrition.” Both of which contain corn oil, canola oil, sugar, corn syrup and nothing that I’d ever touch or deem healthy and safe for anyone of any age, especially the oldest and the youngest people in the world.

You may be seeing the Apeel sticker or label on your produce, but there are also other brands using this coating on their produce. Thankfully (PHEW!) some brands are bragging about it because it helps the produce last longer and they saving tons of plastic. I’d rather have the plastic than the crappy coating on my cucumbers, apples and lemons, thank you.

Exactly how old is that apple in your fridge? You’ll never know. As time goes on, produce loses nutritional value, but you won’t be able to tell how fresh it is because of the Apeel coating being used. This is misleading, dishonest and doing you a (nutritional) disservice. Your avocado might look like it was picked yesterday from a nearby farm… but it could be 31 days old. Check out this photo below and see what an normal, real, not-messed-with-by-Apeel avocado would look like after 31 days and then look at what the “tainted” (treated with Apeel) avocado looks like. It looks good right? Yes! But it’s modified! Produce loses 30% (conservatively) of it’s nutrients just 3 days after being harvested due to light, oxygen and heat.

You will find Apeel products in places like Costco, Trader Joes, Gelsons, Ralphs, Sprouts, Vons, Walmart, Whole Foods, Kroger, Harps Foods, Wakefern brand stores including Price Right, Fairway Market, Target, Bristol Farms and more. Some of the produce companies using Apeel are Topline, Index Fresh, Calve, Del Monte, West Park, Horton Fruit Co, Del Ray Avocado, Natures Pride and more.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_974962,"The United Nations is working to mainstream sex with minors, stating in a report that relations with underage individuals can be considered consensual despite worldwide prohibitions on such acts.

""Sexual conduct involving persons below the domestically prescribed minimum age of consent to sex may be consensual in fact, if not in law,"" several U.N.-backed organizations claimed in a March report that advocates decriminalizing these acts as part of a ""human rights-based approach"" to laws governing sexual relations.
""The enforcement of criminal law should reflect the rights and capacity of persons under 18 years of age to make decisions about engaging in consensual sexual conduct and their right to be heard in matters concerning them,"" according to the report, authored by the International Committee of Jurists (ICJ) with support from UNAIDS and the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""Pursuant to their evolving capacities and progressive autonomy, persons under 18 years of age should participate in decisions affecting them, with due regard to their age, maturity, and best interests, and with specific attention to non-discrimination guarantees.""
The U.N. report echoes the thinking of groups like the North American Man-Boy Love Association, which condones pedophilia and works to abolish age-of-consent laws. While the report stops short of calling for the legalization of sex with minors, it maintains that those under 18 years of age have the mental capacity to willingly have sex with older individuals. The report is raising red flags with experts who say the United Nations is trying to mainstream underage sex as it pushes a woke ideology that has long existed at the fringes of society.
""This document advocates for a lot of troubling ideas and bad policies,"" said Grace Melton, a Trump administration appointee to the United Nations who works as an analyst for the Heritage Foundation think tank. ""Not only does it suggest that minors may be mature enough to consent to sexual activity, but it also asserts that 'criminal law may not in any way impair' the so-called right to abortion or to 'gender-affirming care.'""
The report, Melton added, ""illustrates some of the consequences of the progressive left's expansion of what constitutes 'human rights.'""
Other portions of the report advocate for the mass decriminalization of sex acts. As part of this decriminalization, ""consensual sexual conduct, irrespective of the type of sexual activity, the sex/gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression of the people involved, or their marital status, may not be criminalized in any circumstances,"" according to the report. ""Consensual same-sex, as well as consensual different-sex sexual relations, or consensual sexual relations with or between trans, nonbinary, and other gender-diverse people, or outside marriage—whether pre-marital or extramarital—may, therefore, never be criminalized.""

Ian Seiderman, the legal and policy director at the ICJ, said in a statement that laws criminalizing sex ""not only violate human rights, but the fundamental principles of criminal law themselves.""

Flat earth proof #2,619,945

Want to see the fact checkers get mad at truth well read this!

The ocean covers 71% of earth's surface it is ONE CONTINOUS BODY OF WATER that has found its containment.

The ocean has no elevation features to its surface hence why we have SEA-LEVEL.

The continents are large islands that are popping above the ocean level, therefore they are “dry land”, inside contained, flat water with elevation features.

You'll understand that the only way to establish a level is to contain the water from all sides first.

Every huge body of water needs to be contained from all sides.

Once water is contained from all sides, a level can exist.

Now, when a level exists, continents can exist above it.

Most importantly, you'll understand why only a container can establish a leveled surface and that they are co-dependent on each other in order to exist.

If you see a body of water that is flat on the top, you know the water found a level and water only find a level when it's contained.
If the island has a continuous 360 shoreline, it means the water found a level around it and that there's another shoreline on the other side. This proves there's a continental shelf holding the water together from all sides.

Antarctica HAS shorelines its not completely ice. It wraps 360* degrees around the earth. OUR CONTAINER.

SEA-LEVEL It's called sea level for a reason. No matter what the peaks and valleys are on the bottom of the ocean NOT on the SURFACE like CONTINENTS.

Water at the surface remains level. Water curving/bending in its natural state has never been observed.

HORIZONTAL LINE COMES FROM HORIZON. Never does it change to a curved line NEVER.

I encourage you to test water using the scientific method, start with a glass of water and work your way up to a bowl, a puddle, a bathtub, a swimming pool, etc.

I challenge you to create a working model of an island immersed in water with a full shoreline...without having a container first,
YOU CAN'T. Welcome to reality."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_48124,"Sudan’s National Public Health Laboratory – whose recent seizure by militants has prompted warnings of causing a “huge biological risk” – received financial and personnel support from U.S. government bodies including the Department of Defense, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institutes of Health agency, War Room can reveal.

The stunning revelation follows Nima Saeed Abid, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Sudan, admitting the situation was ""extremely dangerous” because “we have polio isolates in the lab, we have measles isolates in the lab, we have cholera isolates in the lab.” U.S. federal funding has directly supported research conducted by researchers from the high-risk laboratory into cholera.

""There is a huge biological risk associated with the occupation of the central public health lab in Khartoum by one of the fighting parties,” he added.

The lab, which is based in the country’s capital Khartoum, is a recipient of support from a variety U.S. government agencies including the Department of Defense (DOD), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), and United States Agency for International Development (USAID). During Dr. Fauci’s tenure as a National Institutes of Health (NIH) agency leader, he also allocated funds to support research involving scientists from the controversial laboratory.

CDC.

 A pamphlet titled “CDC In South Sudan,” published in August of 2022, reveals the extent of the government agency’s involvement in the country.

“In May 2018, CDC supported establishment of the first viral load monitoring facility at South Sudan’s National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL),” explains a synopsis of the CDC’s involvement with the lab.

A key feature of the CDC’s involvement with the lab was “Laboratory Systems Strengthening,” with the agency noting:

“Since 2006, CDC has partnered with the Global Fund to support South Sudan’s NPHL by strengthening laboratory infrastructure, staffing, and technical capacity.”
“With technical support from CDC, the Ministry of Health developed and released consolidated national HIV treatment guidelines and five laboratory manuals and standard operating procedures for NPHL staff and HIV/AIDS program staff,” continues the CDC.

Moreover, a research paper published in July 2022 – “Viral load scale-up in South Sudan: Strategic implementation of tools to monitor HIV treatment success among people living with HIV” – involving the controversial Sudanese laboratory counts financial support from the CDC through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The paper includes two researchers from the NPHL alongside four CDC researchers from the Divisions of Global HIV & TB and Healthcare Quality Promotion.

The paper’s acknowledgment section also identifies the “US Agency for International [and]  Development, US Department of Defense” for providing the researchers with “support,” though it fails to provide any further information.

FAUCI/NIH.

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the NIH agency previously run by Dr. Fauci, has also funded a research paper counting researchers from Sudan’s NPHL. Curiously, the 2017 paper – “Dried Blood Spots for Measuring Vibrio cholerae-specific Immune Responses” – focuses on cholera in Sudan, which is one of the diseases flagged by the WHO as being affected by the seizure.

A researcher listed on the paper, Lul O. Deng, works for the Sudanese NPHL.

“This work was supported by The National Institute of Health (K08 AI100923 to D.T.L., R01 AI130378 to D.T.L., AI106878 to E.T.R., AI099243 and AI103055 to J.B.H.),” explains the paper.

The aforementioned grants all come from the NIAID during Fauci’s tenure and totals over 20 million dollars, as revealed in the breakdown below:

K08 AI100923: $685,800
R01 AI130378: $1,805,616
AI106878: $7,341,083
AI099243: $7,877,483
AI103055: $3,850,785
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation were also co-funders of the study.

USAID.

USAID increased its collaborations with the lab during COVID-19, with a press release revealing it “funded procurement of COVID-19 tests and provided equipment” and “designated regional laboratories to rapidly scale up testing capabilities.”

A WHO press release from 2018 also reveals the agency’s involvement with the NPHL:

‘Thanks to Global Fund, ECHO, CDC and USAID, South Sudan has made progress in building and strengthening the laboratory capacity to test and report results in a safe, secure, timely and reliable manner for outbreaks and emergencies, the challenging circumstances notwithstanding said Evans Liyosi, WHO Representative for South Sudan. He noted that this development is in line with the expectations of the WHO Laboratory Improvement for Emergencies (LIFE) initiative and the International Health regulations, for vulnerable WHO member states including South Sudan.”
Deja Vu.

The revelations about U.S. government involvement in Sudan’s NPHL follow similar scrutiny over support from a Hunter Biden-linked company for Ukrainian Biolabs working on “extremely dangerous pathogens.” It also follows Dr. Fauci allocating millions of taxpayer dollars to support gain-of-function research on coronavirus strains strikingly similar to COVID-19 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_848430,"Many people have been quietly warning that the Democratic Party is preparing a bait and switch for the 2024 presidential nomination and will at the last possible minute throw Joe Biden under the bus and replace him with Michelle Obama.

Now, The Western Journal’s own Floyd Brown, author of the new book “Counterpunch: An Unlikely Alliance of Americans Fighting Back for Faith and Freedom,” is saying that the Democrats are slyly signaling that they do indeed intend to dump Biden and run Obama in 2024.

Brown appeared on Newsmax on Wednesday to talk about the developing race for the White House.

After saying that RFK Jr., who recently launched his campaign, will “shake up the race” for the Democrats, Brown dropped a bombshell about the former first lady.

“I’ve been saying for a while something that’s kind of an outlier,” Brown said, “and that is I think Michelle Obama is going to be the Democratic nominee.”

“When they moved the convention to Chicago, that was their tell,” he added, “because they moved it to her hometown.”

Guest Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign aide, replied, “Look, I think she would be a formidable candidate on the Democratic side.”

“I don’t think she’s going to do it. I think ultimately that that’s the last thing she wants to do given the life that she has and the fact that she didn’t really like being in the White House the first time around,” Gates continued.

“But if she were to enter it, it would absolutely shake up things and I think that it would give Joe Biden an opportunity to exit quickly,” he concluded.

Brown is not the only person to deliver this warning about Obama entering the race for president.

Recently, former Clinton strategist Dick Morris argued that if she runs in 2024, Biden will be toast.

At the end of April, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich also warned of a possible Obama candidacy, noting that she is still extremely popular among Democrats.

“I think Republicans had better pay significant attention to Michelle Obama,” Gingrich said.

Still, Obama has addressed this question a number of times and each time has insisted that she has no interest in running for president.

Indeed, in a 2022 interview, Obama claimed she “detests” the idea of running and emphatically said, “No, I’m not going to run.”

Granted, nearly every single person who has run for the White House in modern times has loudly insisted they weren’t going to run… until they were. Hillary Clinton, for instance, said she would not run for president in 2016.

It is quite possible that Obama is just biding her time until Biden fully implodes so that she can then sweep in and enjoy her coronation as the 2024 Democratic nominee.

And if she did announce, the media would proclaim her the de facto president no matter whom she faced. She would indeed be hard to beat."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_336769,"Chelsea Clinton has declared that unvaccinated children in America must be forced to take the mRNA jab with or without parental consent.

Chelsea – via the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) – along with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says she hopes to force jab unvaccinated children via a new initiative called “The Big Catch-up.”

“The Big Catch-up” will last 18 months and, according to Bill Clinton’s daughter, aims to become “the largest childhood immunization effort ever.”

Childrenshealthdefense.org reports: Clinton, who serves as vice chair of CHAI, last week presented the initiative at Fortune’s Brainstorm Health Conference in Marina del Rey, California.

One day earlier, under the auspices of World Immunization Week, the WHO introduced “The Big Catch-up,” describing it as a “targeted global effort to boost vaccination among children following declines driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

According to the WHO:

“This effort aims to reverse the declines in childhood vaccination recorded in over 100 countries since the pandemic, due to overburdened health services, closed clinics, and disrupted imports and exports of vials, syringes and other medical supplies.”

During the pandemic, lockdowns led to restricted travel, which limited access to healthcare and other services, and in many cases, families suffered financial hardship, the WHO said.

“Ongoing challenges like conflicts, climate crises and vaccine hesitancy also contributed to the decline in coverage rates,” according to the WHO, which said the new initiative will act as “an extended effort to lift vaccination levels among children to at least pre-pandemic levels and endeavours to exceed those.”

More than 25 million children missed at least one vaccination in 2021 alone, leading to “outbreaks of preventable diseases, including measles, diphtheria, polio and yellow fever,” the WHO said.

“The Big Catch-up” will focus on the 20 countries — all in Africa, Asia and Central and South America — where three-quarters of the children who missed vaccinations in 2021 live.

According to Fortune, citing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), less than 70% of children in the U.S. under age 2 were considered “fully vaccinated” — defined as “having received a full set of shots for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, and other diseases common before the vaccine era” — during 2020-2021.

The CDC data also show that only 10% of children between the ages of 6 months and 4 years had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose as of Dec. 31, 2022.

During her presentation at Fortune’s Brainstorm Health Conference, Clinton described the rise in “vaccine hesitancy” and growing rejection of vaccines as “unfortunate,” adding that she had “tempered” her words.

“No one should die of polio, measles, or pneumonia — including in this country, where we also need people to vaccinate their kids,” she added.

“The Big Catch-up” also aims to promote other vaccines that are not part of childhood immunization schedules.

According to the WHO:

“In addition to catching-up on childhood immunization, intensified efforts are needed to introduce the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to adolescents to prevent cervical cancer, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where the burden is highest.”

Aside from the WHO, CHAI, UNICEF and the Gates Foundation, other partners involved with “The Big Catch-up” include Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and Immunization Agenda 2030.

Commenting on the initiative, Chris Elias, M.D., MPH, president of global development at the Gates Foundation, said “Vaccines are a public health triumph,” adding that “We must double down to reach all children with the vaccines they need to live healthier lives and ensure that future generations live free of preventable diseases like polio.”

Elias participated in a March 2021 simulation of a global monkeypox outbreak that hypothetically would occur in May 2022 — which turned out to be the month that a global outbreak of monkeypox actually began.

Other participants in the simulation included Dr. Margaret Hamburg, a former FDA commissioner on the board of Gavi, and George Fu Gao, Ph.D., former director-general of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who is a member of the WHO’s One Health High-Level Expert Panel that aims to promote the concept of “One Health” globally.

Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, also commented on “The Big Catch-up”:

“We cannot allow a legacy of the pandemic to be the undoing of many years’ work protecting more and more children from deadly, preventable diseases. Global health partners, working with governments and communities, must do everything we can to protect the life of every child.”

Berkley, who formerly was affiliated with the CDC and the Rockefeller Foundation, has previously praised efforts to combat “misinformation” on the internet and the WHO’s decision to extend the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

The Gates Foundation, Gavi, UNICEF, the WHO and the Rockefeller Foundation are interconnected in a number of ways.

Gavi says it “helps vaccinate almost half the world’s children against deadly and debilitating infectious diseases.” It was established in 1999, with the Gates Foundation as one of its co-founders and one of its four permanent board members. Gavi maintains a core partnership with the WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank.

The Gates Foundation is particularly active in relation to malaria, issuing grants to firms conducting research involving genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes, and is connected to research studying a potential malaria vaccine using GM mosquitoes.

The Rockefeller Foundation also is a partner and board member — and donor — to Gavi.

In turn, CHAI, founded in 2002 and “committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and-middle-income countries,” says it works “with partners to prevent and treat malaria, tuberculosis, hepatitis, and cancer [and] accelerate the rollout of lifesaving vaccines.”

Such partners include the Gates Foundation, with which it has collaborated on several projects dating back to 2011, as stated in CHAI’s most recent annual report.

Four pages in CHAI’s 2021 annual report are dedicated exclusively to vaccines, describing immunization as “a powerful tool for saving lives and improving health outcomes globally,” whilst outlining its activities in several countries.

For example, the report states that “In 2021, we worked with Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, and Uganda to improve DTP3 [diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus] immunization.”

Clinton also has a long history of collaborating with the WHO and has been active in the promotion of vaccines even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, as evidenced by the following 2018 tweet:

It’s World Immunization Week! Vaccinations save 2-3 million lives every year by protecting against these diseases and more. #VaccinesWork https://t.co/JIlLo51Pgu

— Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) April 23, 2018
Clinton also participated in an April 10 podcast, “A Conversation about Vaccination with Young Advocates,” alongside Dr. Paul A. Offit, a member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, co-editor of the “Vaccines” textbook and co-inventor of the RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine.

In this podcast, Clinton and Offit discussed “challenges in closing the gap in adolescent vaccination and talk[ed] with teen advocates about their needs and challenges in helping adolescents advocate for their health.”

In other instances, Clinton has been outspoken about alleged vaccine “misinformation.”

In an Aug. 9, 2021, tweet, Clinton wrote that “vaccines save lives” and described this as a “controversial statement … in an era rife with disinformation.”

And in an April 21, 2021, Voices for Vaccines “vax talk,” Clinton explained why she was “working so hard on global health” and “tak[ing] a stand for vaccines.”

In this same talk, Clinton referenced the so-called “Disinformation Dozen” who disseminate alleged vaccine “misinformation.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chairman on leave of Children’s Health Defense, was one of the dozen individuals named in this list."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_131682,"(Natural News) A new pre-print paper published at bioRxiv reveals that long after a person gets “vaccinated” for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) with an mRNA series of injections, the spike proteins generated as a result of the shots persist in their brain tissue.
Researchers out of Germany and Denmark evaluated brain tissue samples both in mouse models and post-mortem humans, looking for the presence and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. They specifically looked at the skull-meninges-brain axis.
They found that spike protein from the shots accumulates in the skull marrow, brain meninges, and brain parenchyma, further explaining that the “injection of the spike protein alone caused cell death in the brain, highlighting a direct effect on brain tissue.”
(Related: Experts warned this would happen but were ignored.)
Even long after a “positive” covid test and infection has passed, spike proteins continue to remain lodged in the human brain. Researchers say these lingering spike proteins could contribute to long-term neurological symptoms such as brain “fog” and brain tissue loss.
“The spike protein was associated with neutrophil-related pathways and dysregulation of the proteins involved in the PI3K-AKT as well as complement and coagulation pathway,” the paper explains.
“Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trafficking from CNS borders into the brain parenchyma and identified differentially regulated pathways may present insights into mechanisms underlying immediate and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 and present diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities.”

Do covid jab spike proteins EVER leave the body?

Up until recently, the federal government, along with some state and local authorities, were pressing Americans to continue getting repeated covid shots and “boosters,” claiming that doing so was the only way to prevent this type of toxic buildup from occurring.
It turns out that the more covid shots a person takes, the more these spikes proteins and who-knows-what-else gets distributed throughout the body, including inside brain tissue, resulting in potentially very serious long-term health problems.
Early on, the world was promised that the contents of these shots dissipate not long after they are injected, leaving behind nothing more than immunity and protection against covid. We now know that this was all a lie, and that the contents of the shots do linger, perhaps forever, while the protection does not.
Walter Chestnut from WMCResearch.org was warning about this back in 2021 following the launch of Operation Warp Speed. He stated that the “robust immune response” the shots supposedly produce, at least according to government officials, “may come at a lethal cost” – and he was right.
It turns out that numerous peer-reviewed studies even back then revealed that spike proteins from the injections lodge themselves throughout the body and stay there, deactivating a person’s telomerase, causing premature aging and possibly death.
As telomeres shorten over time, they expose a person’s DNA to increasing levels of corruption, which is when aging symptoms really start to appear. In the case of covid shots, their spike proteins appear to accelerate the breakdown of telomerase, resulting in rapid aging and premature death for many.
“They will soon be begging for a cure from this new pestilence that they invited into their bodies,” one person wrote about the “fully vaccinated” who are likely regretting their decision to get jabbed right about now.
“Maybe the ‘vaccinated dead’ will be the group to rise up and destroy their makers, kind of like in the book ‘Frankenstein,'” wrote another. “That would be ironic, but I am sure these b***ards who made the ‘vaccine’ have already gamed out that scenario as a possibility.”

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_221580,"On Tuesday, Governor Jay Inslee (D-WA) signed the controversial Senate Bill 5599 introduced by State Sen. Marko Liias (D-Everett), which allows the state to legally take children away from their parents if they don’t consent to their child’s gender transition surgeries or abortion.

Washington state’s current law requires that any youth shelter where a child seeks refuge must notify their parents or guardians within 24 to 72 hours. However, the state law allows them to not tell the parents or legal guardians if they have “compelling reasons” to believe that doing so would put the kid in danger of abuse or neglect.

The newly signed law will allow the government to hide the whereabouts of runaway children who claim to be seeking sex changes or abortions. Meaning, no one can protest the “state-sanctioned kidnapping of children.”

Senate Bill 5599 will remove parents from the health and mental health care decision-making process of their children.

“Trans youth and transgender people have become a target for disinformation campaigns and political stunts that portray them as dangerous or degenerate,” said Inslee during the bill signing Tuesday.

“In Washington State, we reject the politics of transphobia and fear. We look for ways to help LGBTQ remain safe and support it. With this bill, Washington leads the way by taking a more compassionate, developmentally appropriate, and reasoned approach to support these youth as they access gender-affirming treatment and reproductive health care services,” he added.

Democrat Washington State Senator Marko Liias, the prime sponsor of the bill, issued a statement when the bill was signed into law.

“Transgender and at-risk youth deserve safety during difficult times in their life,” said Liias.

“SB5599 to remove barriers to safe shelter for those seeking gender-affirming or reproductive care was signed into law today! I’m so inspired by and honored to work with our LGBTQ community,” he added.

A group has reportedly filed a referendum to overturn SB 5599, as reported by Discovery Institute Senior Journalist Jonathan Choe. The campaign to gather the required number of signatures to appear on the November ballot has officially begun, Choe added.

More of SB 5599 from Clark County Today:

As defined by existing state law, “gender affirming care” includes but is not limited to the following procedures:

Breast augmentation
Chemical peel
Dermabrasion
Facial feminization surgeries
Face lift
Facial masculinization surgeries
Forehead brow lift
Genital modification
Hair line modification
Hair removal by electrolysis or laser
Hysterectomy
Lip enhancement
Reduction thyroid chondroplasty (chondrolaryngoplasty or tracheal shave)
Rhinoplasty
Skin resurfacing
Liposuction
Mastectomy
Penile implant
Voice modification
Combined with HB 1469, which has passed in both chambers, the two policies would allow youth from other states to run away from home, go to a Washington youth shelter seeking an abortion or gender surgery, and the parents would not have to be notified. Also, none of the medical records related to any of those services could be obtained.

One amendment added on the House floor requires OHY to collect data on the number of unsheltered homeless youth in the state, while another requires the Department of Children, Youth, and Families to offer a runaway youth referrals to behavioral health services and services to “resolve the conflict and accomplish a reunification of the family.”

Existing family reunification services include:

Short-term family counseling
Crisis Residential Center services
Referrals for substance abuse treatment and/or counseling
Referrals for mental health services
Short-term placement
Although SB 5599 does not address abuse or neglect, supporters speaking on the House floor before the April 12 vote conflated parents not accepting a child’s claim to be the opposite gender as akin to an “unsafe” home environment."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_750137,"Nearly all COVID-19 patients who died in hospital during the early phase of the pandemic were killed as a direct result of being put on a ventilator, a disturbing new report has concluded.
A new analysis suggests that most patients who were forced to be hooked up to a ventilator due to a COVID-19 infection also developed secondary bacterial pneumonia. This pneumonia was responsible for a higher mortality rate than the COVID-19 infection.
So while COVID-19 may have put these patients in the hospital, it was actually a secondary infection brought on by the use of a mechanical ventilator that caused their deaths.

“Our study highlights the importance of preventing, looking for, and aggressively treating secondary bacterial pneumonia in critically ill patients with severe pneumonia, including those with COVID-19,” says Benjamin Singer, a pulmonologist at Northwestern University in Illinois.

Sciencealert.com reports: The team looked at records for 585 people admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, also in Illinois. They all had severe pneumonia and/or respiratory failure, and 190 had COVID-19.
Using a machine learning approach to crunch through the data, the researchers grouped patients based on their condition and the amount of time they spent in intensive care.
The findings refute the idea that a cytokine storm following COVID-19 – an overwhelming inflammation response causing organ failure – was responsible for a significant number of deaths. There was no evidence of multi-organ failure in the patients studied.

Instead, COVID-19 patients were more likely to develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and for longer periods. Cases where VAP didn’t respond to treatment were significant in terms of the overall mortality rates in the study.
“Those who were cured of their secondary pneumonia were likely to live, while those whose pneumonia did not resolve were more likely to die,” says Singer.
“Our data suggested that the mortality related to the virus itself is relatively low, but other things that happen during the ICU stay, like secondary bacterial pneumonia, offset that.”
These results suggest that ICU outcomes could be improved if there were better strategies to diagnose and treat VAP episodes – something that the researchers say needs to be addressed in the future.
It’s worth bearing in mind that if a patient’s requirement for a ventilator to treat COVID-19 complications leads to VAP, this doesn’t imply that a COVID-19 infection is less dangerous, nor does it decrease the number of COVID-19 fatalities.

As the authors write in their paper, “The relatively long length of stay among patients with COVID-19 is primarily due to prolonged respiratory failure, placing them at higher risk of VAP.”
But the findings highlight a need for further study and to be cautious when making assumptions about the cause of death in COVID-19 cases. A detailed molecular analysis from the same study should reveal more about what makes the difference between recovering or not from VAP.
It’s also another example of how machine learning artificial intelligence can process vast amounts of data and spot patterns beyond us mere humans – whether it’s analyzing proteins or advancing mathematics.
“The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to clinical data can be used to develop better ways to treat diseases like COVID-19 and to assist ICU physicians managing these patients,” says Catherine Gao, also a pulmonologist at Northwestern.
The research has been published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_826647,"This is very disturbing.

It turns out that Minnesota isn’t the only state where the Democrats are determined to normalize pedophilia. Connecticut, too, is taking steps to redefine its Human Rights laws to eliminate restrictions on the definition of “sexual orientation” to include paraphilias that are so offensive that legislators specifically banned their consideration for inclusion in protected classes.

The Family Institute of Connecticut caught the sly changes to the law, which lay the groundwork for including pedophilia as a state-recognized sexual orientation worthy of protection.

As with Minnesota, the changes do not legalize pedophilic acts–it is, thankfully, going to remain illegal for adults to rape children. However, being a “Minor Attracted Person” is no longer sufficient to exclude you from polite society, and may even entitle one to special protections from the state.

The law in question is HB6638. It changes the definition of “sexual orientation.” In current law sexual orientation specifically excludes people whose people whose behavior violates state law, including pedophiles.

Makes sense.

However, what about pedophiles who have violated the law and been released from prison? Or people whose sexual preferences are such that acting upon them would violate the law–pedophiles who have, for instance, sex dolls representing children, and who post photos of scantily clad children on their walls? Those who frequent playgrounds but have not committed crimes or been caught violating the law?

Can I, as a landlord, refuse to rent to them? Or could a daycare provider refuse to hire or even fire somebody who gets off on changing a child’s diapers? What if the person in question goes on vacations to engage in pedophilic activities in placed where it is legal? Not too long ago the Cultural Minister of France did precisely that, even writing about the exquisite nature of his experience, and it presented no barrier to his political power.

Under current law the answer is that you can exclude such people as you like, from employment to housing to…just about anything. If you don’t want to associate with pedophiles, have at it. I kinda like that, and so do the people of Connecticut. Or at least they used to.

Under the changes to the law? Ask a judge, and the answer could easily be “No.” Pedophilia is a protected sexual orientation. You can fire somebody for wearing a MAGA hat, but perhaps not somebody who wears a shirt saying “kids are sexy.”

In what universe is such a change in law sane? There is a reason why the prior iteration of the law was written into statute. And the reason is very simple: it is insane to allow people with dangerous or just plain sick sexual attractions to spend time around the objects of their desire. A pedophile who has yet to be convicted of a crime is not a “safe” adult to have around children.

That’s not the position of a growing cohort of psychologists who are arguing that Minor Attracted Persons (MAPs) need to be accepted into society and not vilified as they currently are. This is not a fringe view. You can find articles from credentialed, practicing researchers and therapists who argue that it is damaging or unfair to vilify pedophilia, and that it is a legitimate sexual orientation.

Defenders of the changes to the law argue that they are simply updating the language to more accurately reflect current mores, and that they have no plans to legalize pedophilia, or even define pedophilia in law as a protected class.

Perhaps, but 1) by not excluding pedophilia from protection, this throws the question to courts and bureaucrats to decide what is an is not protected, and the legislature’s guidance is clear: they excluded it before, and decided to remove the exclusion; and 2) as we have seen in the past decade or three, what “nobody is going to legalize” gets legalized within a few years.

What slippery slope have we NOT slid down in recent years? Who expected schools to drag kids to drag shows where men in skimpy clothes collect money from children while trotting around sexually with almost nothing on? 10 years ago teachers would be fired for doing so; today they are celebrated by the White House.

If citizens don’t stand up and shout now, we will soon be treated to love stories between adults and “consenting” children. Children today are not just allowed, but encouraged to sterilize themselves by lawmakers. They argue that 8, 9, and 10-year-olds can consent to medical procedures at such ages. Consenting to sex with adults is no more, and arguably less extreme than that.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_696531,"UK authorities are investigating an “unusual” surge in severe myocarditis which has hit 15 babies in Wales and England and has killed at least one, the World Health Organisation has announced.

On Tuesday, the WHO issued an alert that there had been a rise in “severe myocarditis” in newborns and infants between June 2022 and March 2023 in Wales and England.

It said that this was associated with the enterovirus infection, which rarely affects the heart.

A UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) spokesperson confirmed to The Epoch Times that 10 babies have been diagnosed in Wales and five have been diagnosed in England.

The WHO said that “although enterovirus infections are common in neonates and young infants, the reported increase in myocarditis with severe outcomes in neonates and infants associated with enterovirus infection is unusual.”

It said that in the same hospital (covering the South Wales region) over the previous six years, “only one other similar case has been identified.”

WHO assessed the public health risk as low, but added that in certain situations, it “may be advisable to close child-care facilities and schools to reduce the intensity of transmission.”

However, the WHO took down the alert on Wednesday. The Epoch Times understands that this could be because some of the numbers were not correct.

The WHO did not respond to The Epoch Times’ request for comment.

Investigation
Authorities in England and Wales are currently investigating the rise in cases.

Dr. Shamez Ladhani, Consultant Paediatrician at UKHSA, told The Epoch Times by email that “given a higher than average number of cases in Wales in the autumn/winter months in very young babies, UKHSA is investigating the situation in England to see if any similar cases have been observed here and whether there are any factors driving the increase in cases.”

The UKHSA did not respond to questions about ruling out any links to the effects of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Public Health Wales at the start of May announced that it was investigating a cluster of severe enterovirus infections with myocarditis occurring in very young babies from the South Wales region.

The cases occurred from June 2022 with a peak in November 2022 involving babies under 28 days old.

Ten babies have developed myocarditis within this cluster. One baby remains in hospital, eight are being managed as outpatients, and one baby has died.

‘Massive Question’
Consultant pathologist and HART member Dr. Clare Craig told The Epoch Times that there’s “a massive question about whether or not these babies or the mums are vaccinated.”

HART is an organisation that was set up to share concerns about policy and guidance recommendations relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Coxsackievirus is a member of a family of viruses called enteroviruses and one of the most common causes of viral myocarditis,” she said.

“And we saw like with other viruses, the diagnosis of Coxsackievirus reduced massively in 2020 when SARS-COV 2 arrived.

She added that the total number of people getting myocarditis after 2020 stayed the same suggesting “SARS-COV 2 filled the niche” that Coxsackievirus had left behind.

“But then the vaccine comes along and from 2021 the incidence rate of myocarditis went sky high,” she added.

“The public health authorities claim that they want to maintain trust and yet they won’t explore these avenues to rule out concerns,” she added.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_197353,"The global climate cult is getting ready to kick its war on food into overdrive with 13 nations – many of them major cattle and food-producing states led by the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Spain – signing onto a commitment to place farmers under new restrictions intended to reduce emissions of methane gas.
The Global Methane Hub announced in a May 17 press release that agriculture and environmental ministers and ambassadors from 13 countries, including the United States, have signed a commitment that pledges to reduce methane emissions in agriculture. The U.S. was represented by Biden’s climate czar, John Kerry.
What does this mean and why should you care? We’ll break it down.
According to the press release issued by these nations and posted at Global Methane Hub:
“Last month (in April 2023), the Global Methane Hub collaborated with the Ministries of Agriculture of Chile and Spain to convene the first-ever global ministerial on agricultural practices to reduce methane emissions. The ministerial brought together high-ranking government members to share global perspectives on methane reduction and low-emission food systems. The gathering led to a statement in which the nations committed to support efforts to improve the quality and quantity of, and access to, finance for climate change adaptation and mitigation measures in the agriculture and food sectors and to collaborate on efforts aimed at lowering methane emissions in agriculture and food systems.”
Conference participants included the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Climate & Clean Air Coalition, Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture, the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the Inter-American Development Bank.
The World Bank, another creation of the post-World War II, U.S.-led liberal rules-based order, has been talking a lot lately, along with the U.N., about a coming famine. The World Bank issued a white paper just last week, on May 22, titled Food Security Update: World Bank Response to Rising Food Insecurity.
The director of the United Nations World Food Program has also been putting out, starting in September of last year, dire warnings about a coming global famine.
So it’s curious to me that, at the very time the globalists are warning about food shortages and famine, their mouthpieces at the World Bank, the U.N., and within the administrations of the U.S. and its allies (notice China and Russia are nowhere to be found in these preposterous anti-food policies), are talking about converting over to a new and unproven form of “sustainable” farming that’s focused more on reducing methane than it is on producing the highest yields of food.
Modern food production is bad, they tell us, because it produces methane which supposedly harms the environment.
“Food systems are responsible for 60% of methane emissions,” said Marcelo Mena, CEO of Global Methane Hub. “We congratulate countries willing to take the lead in food systems methane mitigation and confirm our commitment to support this type of initiative with programs that explore promising methane mitigation technologies and the underpinning research of methane mitigation mechanisms to create new technologies.”
John Kerry is also very excited about taking valuable, productive farmland offline, reducing the size of cattle herds, and turning our food-production systems over to technocrats and globalists offering vague promises of “new technologies.”
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. is busy trying to mitigate methane emissions not just in America but worldwide, stating on its website: “The United States provides key leadership, funding and technical expertise for international methane emission reduction efforts, resulting in more than 1,140 methane mitigation projects through GMI as of 2021.”
In just one example, the Biden administration plans to spend $1.5 million in taxpayer funds on a program aimed at “empowering” female climate change activists in the “patriarchal” society of northern Kenya, documents reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon show.
John Kerry said in a statement, “Mitigating methane is the fastest way to reduce warming in the short term. Food and agriculture can contribute to a low-methane future by improving farmer productivity and resilience. We welcome agriculture ministers participating in the implementation of the Global Methane Pledge.”
The May 17 press release further states that, “The focus of the conference was the deployment of science-based practices, innovation, and technologies in line with sustainable food production…”
The nations signing onto this pledge to transform their farm policies are the United States, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Chile, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Germany, Panama, Peru and Spain.
The government of Spain will organize a second conference in 2024 to monitor and advance implementation efforts related to the statement and encourage more countries to join, according to the May 14 press release.
In order to save the planet from emissions that come from cow farts, they claim it’s necessary to force farmers to change the way they farm, converting their land and livestock to more “innovative” methods and “science-based practices.” These methods will need to be implemented not just on farms but throughout the “food systems.”
They never come out and say what these “innovative” changes are, only that they will be based on “new technologies” and “science-based.”
We can presume from this language that among the practices being considered are replacing a major portion of the beef and dairy cattle, pork and chicken stocks that populations rely on for protein with insect larvae, meal worms, crickets, etc. The U.N., World Economic Forum and other NGOs have been promoting meatless diets and the consumption of insect protein for years, and billionaires have invested in massive insect factories being built in the state of Illinois, in Canada and in the Netherlands, where meal worms, crickets and other bugs will be processed as additives to be inserted into the food supply, often without clear labels that will inform people of exactly what they are eating. Bill Gates is also partnering with other billionaires to invest in the production of lab-grown meat, a process that involves using cancer cells from cows, chickens and pigs to quickly grow artificial meat.
Farmers will be increasingly forced off their land, as is already happening in the Netherlands, which is the world’s second leading net exporter of food after the United States.
All this will add up to a coming famine the likes of which has never been witnessed by the current generation of people on earth. It’s all by design. Globalists like Dennis Meadows, the author of the 1972 Club of Rome-endorsed book The Limits to Growth, informed us of the globalists’ plans to drastically depopulate the earth. His comments in the video below were made I believe in 2017.

I’ve also reported extensively on the Deagel forecast, which forecasted a nearly 70 percent reduction in the population of America by 2025, with similarly drastic population declines for the U.K., Germany, Canada, Australia and other NATO-aligned countries.
There is no more efficient way to depopulate than through war, famine and plagues. Isn’t it interesting that all three of these time-tested methods of murder are in play right now?
The war on food is very similar to what’s going on in the energy sector, where governments are colluding with big business to transform all transportation from gas-powered to electric-powered, meaning far fewer people will be able to afford electric cars, and even if they can afford them, the use of those cars will be much more tightly monitored and controlled due to the need for charging stations that rely on an already overtaxed power grid. If you can’t charge your car up when you want to, only when you are allowed to, you have now turned over your freedom of movement to the regulators of those charging stations.
In the food industry, Big Agriculture will also collude with the governments of the world to produce much less beef, chicken and pork, replacing that protein with insects and lab-grown fake meat, the health effects of which are largely unknown.
These changes have already been on full display in the Netherlands, where the government has generated intense controversy by launching a plan to reduce livestock herds by up to 50 percent, and reduce the use of nitrogen fertilizers by 30 percent. No matter how much they talk about “innovation” and “new technologies,” you can’t reduce your herds and reduce your use of fertilizer and then claim that your farms will be “more productive.” That’s a lie. All of their “innovations” will translate directly into less food on tables throughout the world.
Prepare now for famine. Stocking your pantry up is a short-term easy fix. We also need to be thinking long-term. If you’ve never grown a garden or raised chickens, that’s something you might want to think about in terms of increasing your skills. Maybe you’ve grown a garden for several years and have some experience, and you can share that with a neighbor who has raised chickens but has little or no gardening experience. Networking and cooperating with the people around us will be the key to survival once this global famine intensifies.
It may be that the actual famine never arrives in the wealthiest countries like America. Food may continue to be on the shelves, but I can guarantee that prices will continue to go up, substantially, on staple items like flour, bread, eggs, meat and dairy.
Pray for the best while preparing for the worst. Because we know that the globalists’ plan is to reduce the world population from 7.5 billion down to 1 or 2 billion. Dennis Meadows let the cat out of the bag and he’s a globalist insider at the Club of Rome whose engagement on this topic goes back to the early 1970s.

Pictured: Police officers observe a protest of parents and progressives at a Pride Month event at a Los Angeles elementary school. (Photo: Myung J. Chun, Getty Images)

A recently amended California bill would add “affirming” the sexual transition of a child to the state’s standard for parental responsibility and child welfare—making any parent who doesn’t affirm transgenderism for their child guilty of abuse under California state law.

AB 957 passed California’s State Assembly on May 3, but a co-sponsor amended it after hours in California’s State Senate on June 6. 

Assembly Member Lori Wilson, D-Suisun City, wrote the bill and introduced it on Feb. 14. State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, co-sponsored it. Wilson’s child identifies as transgender.

Originally, AB 957 required courts to consider whether a child’s parents were “gender-affirming” in custody cases. Wiener’s amendment completely rewrites California’s standard of child care.

AB 957 post-amendment “would include a parent’s affirmation of the child’s gender identity as part of the health, safety, and welfare of the child,” altering the definition and application of the entire California Family Code.

California courts would be given complete authority under Section 3011 of California’s Family Code to remove a child from his or her parents’ home if parents disapprove of LGBTQ+ ideology.

By changing the definition of what constitutes the “health, safety, and welfare of [a] child,” schools, churches, hospitals, and other organizations interacting with children would be required to affirm “gender transitions” in minors by default—or risk charges of child abuse.

AB 957 could also expand which organizations provide “evidence” of gender “nonaffirmation” to California’s courts.

Because of the addition of “gender affirmation” to the qualifications of California’s standards for “health, safety, and welfare,” California’s courts would now be able to accept reports of gender “abuse” from progressive activist organizations—as long as they claim to provide “services to victims of sexual assault or domestic violence.”

In essence, a boy could report his parents to his local school’s Gay-Straight Alliance club or other LGBTQ+ organization, who could then report the boy’s parents for child abuse.

Incredibly, the bill provides no definition whatsoever of what would qualify as “nonaffirming” to a child’s gender. 

As Susannah Luthi of The Washington Free Beacon points out, “The bill makes no distinctions regarding the age of a child, how long a child has identified as transgender, or affirmation of social transition versus medical sex-change treatments.”

It remains unclear what law or precedent California courts would be able to cite in determining whether a parent was affirming—much less to define a standard that applies to all situations.

AB 957 isn’t Wiener’s first foray into legislating transgenderism for children. Last year, Wiener authored bill SB 107, making California the first state to establish itself as a sanctuary for minors’ transgender treatments and surgeries. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed the bill into law in September.

In March, Advocates for Faith and Freedom sued Newsom’s administration in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California Western Division.

Parental rights advocates and experts lambasted Wiener’s amendment that would upend the California Family Code.

Jay Richards, the Director of the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Life, Religion, and Family at The Heritage Foundation, calls AB 957 a “grotesque violation.” (The Daily Signal is Heritage’s multimedia news organization.)

Nicole Pearson, founder of the Facts Law Truth Justice law firm and civil rights advocacy group, condemned AB 957’s unconstitutionality in an interview with The Daily Signal:

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_67430,"A top official with the World Economic Forum (WEF) has called for religious scripture to be “rewritten” by artificial intelligence (AI) to create a globalized “new Bible.”
Yuval Noah Harari, the senior advisor to the WEF and its chairman Klaus Schwab, argues that using AI to replace scriptures will create unified “religions that are actually correct.”
Harari, an influential author and professor, made the call while giving a talk on the “future of humanity.”
According to Harari, the power of AI can be harnessed and used to reshape spirituality into the WEF’s globalist vision of “equity” and inclusivism.
Speaking with journalist Pedro Pinto in Lisbon, Portugal, Harari told the elitist audience:
“It’s the first technology ever that can create new ideas.
“You know, the printing press, radio, television, they broadcast, they spread the ideas created by the human brain, by the human mind.
“They cannot create a new idea.
“You know, [Johannes] Gutenberg printed the Bible in the middle of the 15th century; the printing press printed as many copies of the Bible as Gutenberg instructed it, but it did not create a single new page.
“It had no ideas of its own about the Bible: Is it good? Is it bad? How to interpret this? How to interpret that?”
Harari then revealed that he and his allies at the WEF have a solution to the supposed problems he’d just highlighted.
“AI can create new ideas; [it] can even write a new Bible,” he declared.
“Throughout history, religions dreamt about having a book written by a superhuman intelligence, by a non-human entity,” he added.

“In a few years, there might be religions that are actually correct … just think about a religion whose holy book is written by an AI.
“That could be a reality in a few years.”
WATCH:

Harari noted in another recent gathering that software like ChatGPT has mastered human languages and can harness that function to influence culture, the Times of Israel said.
“For thousands of years, prophets and poets and politicians have used language and storytelling in order to manipulate and to control people and to reshape society,” he said, according to the paper.
“Now AI is likely to be able to do it.
“And once it can… it doesn’t need to send killer robots to shoot us.
“It can get humans to pull the trigger.”
Harari also said that “contrary to what some conspiracy theories assume, you don’t really need to implant chips in people’s brains in order to control them or to manipulate them,” the paper noted.
He also warned that “we need to act quickly before AI gets out of our control” and that “governments must immediately ban the release into the public domain of any more revolutionary AI tools before they are made safe,” the paper added.
Harari frequently pushes ideas that involve humanity being replaced by machines.
As Slay News previously reported, Harari gloated last year that “we just don’t need the vast majority of the population” in today’s world.
According to Harari, most of the general public has now become “redundant” and will be of little use to the global elite in the future.
Harari argues that modern technologies like artificial intelligence “make it possible to replace the people.”
“If you go back to the middle of the 20th century — and it doesn’t matter if you’re in the United States with Roosevelt, or if you’re in Germany with Hitler, or even in the USSR with Stalin — and you think about building the future, then your building materials are those millions of people who are working hard in the factories, in the farms, the soldiers,” Harari said.
“You need them.
“Now, fast forward to the early 21st century when we just don’t need the vast majority of the population,” he added.
“The future is about developing more and more sophisticated technology, like artificial intelligence [and] bioengineering.
“Most people don’t contribute anything to that, except perhaps for their data, and whatever people are still doing which is useful, these technologies increasingly will make redundant and will make it possible to replace the people.”"

Not only is it in breach of US Flag Code, but it’s a glaring example of this White Houses’ incompetence and insistence on putting their social agenda ahead of patriotism."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_350386,"The chief accountant at Ukraine’s Burisma Energy, who offered to provide US authorities with damning evidence regarding financial crimes involving Joe and Hunter Biden, has been found dead before she could testify.
The Burisma whistleblower, who has been identified as the wife of the former Burisma owner Mykola Lisin, who also died in suspicious circumstances during the years of the Obama administration when vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter were active in Ukraine.
Giuliani discussed the fate of the now-deceased whistleblower during an interview on Newsmax’s “Saturday Report” with Rita Cosby.

According to Giuliani, who first brought to light Hunter Biden’s notorious “Laptop from Hell”, the whistleblower was the chief accountant at Burisma, the notoriously corrupt Ukrainian energy company.
During Joe Biden’s tenure as vice president under Obama, Burisma compensated Hunter with tens of thousands of dollars per month for his position on the company’s board, despite his complete lack of experience in the energy sector.
During that period, then-Vice President Biden withheld U.S. assistance to Ukraine as a means of pressuring the government to dismiss Viktor Shokin, a senior prosecutor who was investigating Burisma and its owner for fraudulent activities.
Giuliani, who previously served as President Donald Trump’s attorney, says the whistleblower offered to give a U.S. attorney highly compromising financial information about the Bidens.
However, Giuliani says US authorities did everything they could to ignore her, bouncing her case around various offices, in an attempt to make her go away.
He revealed that the Pittsburgh attorney general had initially been investigating the case.
But the investigation was later transferred to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Delaware, under former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr.
Giuliani claims the Delaware office buried the case, despite the whistleblower being under threat of death.
He says the whistleblower had evidence that included offshore bank account information that showed millions of dollars in bribes flowing to the Biden family and “other crooked politicians.”

Despite the explosive nature of the evidence, Giuliani says prosecutors stonewalled the case and she died suddenly before she could testify.
And now the mainstream media are refusing to acknowledge her existence.
“Well, of course, that’s the most ridiculous, idiotic statement to make on a day in which we find out that the Bidens took a $10 million bribe from a Ukrainian Mykola Zlochevsky, which I could have told you, you know, and did tell [the DOJ] three years ago,” Giuliani told Newsmax.
“And they followed up on none of the evidence I gave them. They were hoping that people would disappear or die. It’s extraordinary.”
Giuliani revealed that he gave the DOJ “one witness … who is a woman, who is the chief accountant at this crooked company, Burisma.
“She was the wife of the former owner who died under suspicious circumstances. And, she was willing to give up all of the offshore bank accounts, including the Bidens’ accounts.
“She supervised the transfer of a lot more cash to the Bidens and other crooked politicians for Burisma.”
Cosby asked “Are you confident that now the House Committee is going to get to the bottom of that? Because that is stunning.”
“The reality is that we gave it to them in January of 2020, and the Pittsburgh US attorney was very interested,” Giuliani replied.
“And then in a very strange move, Barr took it away from him, gave it to the US attorney in Delaware. He didn’t do a damn thing about it,” he revealed.
“And the woman was under threat of death. So, we tried to put pressure on them to do something,” he explained.
“Look, suppose she was lying. You would find out in a minute she wouldn’t have the accounts. She either has the goods or she doesn’t. And it’s absurd not to interview her. She claims she had bank accounts and that the Bidens got a lot more money under the table than already.”
“We had $8 million on the table that we could prove, which they could prove tomorrow if they wanted to they could have proved it three years ago, Rita,” he added. “They could have indicted him before he ran for president and obviated this problem.
“We could have found out if he was innocent or guilty in January of 2020.
“All the witnesses were there, and I have him on tape like Shokin. Shokin was willing to come and testify.” Watch:"

This new discovery of the presence of monkey virus DNA, including tumor-linked viral promoters, in the jabs has this microbiologist and immunologist calling for an immediate halt in the use of mRNA “vaccines.”
[embed]https://rumble.com/embed/v2mb33q/?pub=4[/embed]
STORY AT-A-GLANCE

Microbiologist Kevin McKernan—a former researcher and team leader for the MIT Human Genome Project—has discovered massive DNA contamination in the mRNA COVID-19 shots, including simian virus 40 (SV40) promoters.
SV40 has been linked to cancer in humans, including mesotheliomas, lymphomas, and cancers of the brain and bone. In 2002, the Lancet published evidence linking polio vaccines contaminated with SV40 to Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. According to the authors, the vaccine may be responsible for up to 50 percent of the 55,000 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases diagnosed each year.
The level of contamination varies depending on the platform used to measure it, but no matter which method is used, the level of DNA contamination is significantly higher than the regulatory limits in both Europe and the United States. The highest level of DNA contamination found was 30 percent.
The finding of DNA means the mRNA COVID-19 shots may have the ability to alter the human genome.
Even if genetic modification does not occur, the fact that you’re getting foreign DNA into your cells poses a risk in and of itself. Partial expression could occur, or it might interfere with other transcription translations that are already in the cell. Cytoplasmic transfection can also allow for genetic manipulation, as the nucleus disassembles and exchanges cellular components with the cytosol during cell division.

In the video1 above, Dr. Steven E. Greer interviews microbiologist Kevin McKernan—a former researcher and team leader for the MIT Human Genome project2—and Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi about the DNA contamination McKernan’s team has found in the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA shots.
As it turns out, spike protein and the mRNA are not the only hazards of these injections. McKernan’s team has also discovered simian virus 40 (SV40) promoters that, for decades, have been suspected of causing cancer in humans, including mesotheliomas, lymphomas, and cancers of the brain and bone.3 The findings4,5,6,7 were posted on OSF Preprints in early April 2023. As explained in the abstract:8

As noted by Greer,9 this means that governments and drug companies “have misled the world to a far greater extent than previously known.” If these findings are correct, it would also mean that “the so-called ‘vaccines’ are actually altering the human genome and causing permanent production of the deadly spike protein,” and this internal production of spike protein would, in turn, “trigger the immune system to attack its own cells,” Greer says.

In the interview, McKernan explains how the DNA contaminants found in the COVID-19 jabs can result in the genetic modification of the human genome, and Bhakdi reviews how and why the shots can trigger autoimmune diseases.
Background: What Is SV40?

In 2002, the Lancet published10 evidence linking polio vaccines contaminated with SV40 to Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. According to the authors, the vaccine may be responsible for up to half the 55,000 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases diagnosed each year.
How did this simian (monkey) virus get into the human population? According to the late Dr. Maurice Hilleman, a leading vaccine developer, Merck inadvertently unleashed the virus via their polio vaccine.11 It’s unclear exactly when SV40 was eliminated from the polio vaccine. The timing also varies from country to country. For example, SV40-contaminated polio vaccines were administered in Italy as recently as 1999.12
As reported in a Lancet book review of “The Virus and the Vaccine: The True Story of a Cancer-Causing Monkey Virus, Contaminated Polio Vaccine and the Millions of Americans Exposed”:13

mRNA COVID Jabs Contaminated With Double-Stranded DNA

With that background, let’s get back to McKernan’s findings, which in addition to the featured video are also discussed in Daniel Horowitz’s podcast above. In short, his team discovered elevated levels of double-stranded DNA plasmids, including SV40 promoters (DNA sequence that is essential for gene expression) that are known to trigger cancer development when encountering an oncogene (a gene that has the potential to cause cancer).

The level of contamination varies depending on the platform used to measure it, but no matter which method is used, the level of DNA contamination is significantly higher than the regulatory limits in both Europe and the United States, McKernan says. The highest level of DNA contamination found was 30 percent, which is rather astounding.
As explained by McKernan, when using a typical PCR test, you’ll be considered positive if the test detects the SARS-CoV-2 virus using a cycle threshold (CT) of about 40. In comparison, the DNA contamination is detected at CTs below 20.

That means the contamination is a million-fold greater than the amount of virus you’d need to have in order to test positive for COVID-19. “So, there’s an enormous difference here with regards to the amount of material that’s in there,” McKernan says.

In his Substack article,14 he also points out that people who argue that double-stranded DNA and viral RNA is a false equivalency because viral RNA is replication competent, are wrong.

In that Substack article, McKernan has also copied a 2009 study discussing how DNA in vaccines can cause cancer and highlighted the most relevant parts. It’s a helpful resource if you want to learn more.
Quality Control Is Sorely Lacking

As for how SV40 promoters ended up in the mRNA shots, it appears to be related to poor quality control during the manufacturing process, although it’s unclear where in the development SV40 might have sneaked in. Quality control deficiencies may also be responsible for the high rate of anaphylactic reactions we’ve been seeing. McKernan tells Greer:

Regulatory Agencies Knew There Was a Contamination Problem

In a May 20 Substack article,16 McKernan points out that Pfizer itself submitted evidence to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) showing sampled lots contained vast differences in the levels of double-stranded DNA contamination.

The arbitrary limit for dsDNA that the EMA came up with was 330 nanograms per milligram (ng/mg). Data submitted to the EMA by Pfizer shows sampled lots had anywhere from 1 ng/mg to 815 ng/mg of DNA. McKernan adds:17

Double-Stranded DNA May Integrate Into Your Genome

The presence of double-stranded DNA also brings up another major concern, and that is the possibility of genomic integration.

While McKernan’s paper does not present evidence of genome integration, it does point out that it’s possible, especially in the presence of SV40 promoters:19

Manifold Risks

That said, even if genetic modification does not occur, the fact that you’re getting foreign DNA into your cells poses a risk in and of itself, McKernan says. For example, partial expression could occur, or it might interfere with other transcription translations that are already in the cell.
Bhakdi also points out that the SV40 promoters do not need to be present in the nucleus of the cell for problems to occur. Cytoplasmic transfection can, in and of itself, allow for genetic manipulation, because the nucleus disassembles and exchanges cellular components with the cytosol during cell division.

In addition to having DNA floating around and causing potential problems, the RNA in the COVID-19 jab is also modified to resist breakdown. “So, we have TWO versions of the spike protein floating around that can persist longer than anticipated,” McKernan says, and the spike protein, of course, is the most toxic part of the virus that can cause your body to attack itself.

Both McKernan and Bhakdi are adamant that ALL mRNA “vaccines” must be immediately stopped, whether for human or animal use, due to the magnitude of the risks involved.
‘Alarming Problems’

In the video above,20 Yusuke Murakami, a professor at Tokyo University, expresses alarm over the finding of SV40 promoters in the COVID-19 jabs. The interview is in Japanese but has English subtitles. I’ve included it because I think he does a good job of putting the problem into layman’s terms:

Resources for Those Injured by the COVID Jab

The more we learn about the COVID-19 jabs, the worse they appear. While they suck as vaccines, they’re capable of destroying health in any number of ways, through myriad mechanisms.
If you got one or more jabs and are now reconsidering, first and foremost, never ever take another COVID-19 booster, another mRNA gene therapy shot, or regular vaccine. You need to end the assault on your body. Even if you haven’t experienced any obvious side effects, your health may still be impacted long-term, so don’t take any more shots.

If you’re suffering from side effects, your first order of business is to eliminate the spike protein that your body is producing. Two remedies that can do this are hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. Both of these drugs bind and facilitate the removal of spike protein.

The Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) has developed a post-vaccine treatment protocol called I-RECOVER. Since the protocol is continuously updated as more data become available, your best bet is to download the latest version straight from the FLCCC website at covid19criticalcare.com21 (hyperlink to the correct page provided above).
For additional suggestions, check out the World Health Council’s spike protein detox guide,22 which focuses on natural substances like herbs, supplements, and teas. To combat neurotoxic effects of spike protein, a March 2022 review paper23 suggests using luteolin and quercetin. Time-restricted eating (TRE) and/or sauna therapy can also help eliminate toxic proteins by stimulating autophagy."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_843003,"We had five years to stop using fossil fuels to prevent wiping out “all of humanity” from June 21st 2018, Greta Thunberg claimed in a now-deleted Tweet.
Today is the anniversary of a doomsday prediction made by Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg when she was just 15 years old June 21st 2018, stating the human race had five years to end fossil fuels or face certain death. She wrote then:
A top climate scientist is warning that climate change will wipe out all of humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years.
While these alarming, but later forgotten warnings with very definite and certain sounding timescales are a major part of green propaganda, this particular instance has taken on a life of its own due to the Streisand Effect, given as the deadline date approached Thunberg was caught having deleted the claim.

As previously reported, remembering these deadline predictions are dangerous for the left because if civilisation really is beyond the point of no return, they lose all their political power. Fact-checkers have tried to neuter the Tweet-delete by pointing out she said humanity would merely run out of time to save itself this year, not that humanity would actually end in 2023, pointing out what is obvious to anyone with basic reading comprehension.
As for Thunberg, she certainly isn’t acting like anything changes today. Indeed, as reported she was spending this week getting picked up by police for sitting in front of oil tankers, hardly the act of a woman who believes all hope is now lost."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_210535,"United States Navy SEALs on Sunday rescued “hundreds” of enslaved children from the hold of a crude oil tanker berthed in San Francisco Bay, a source in General Eric M. Smith’s office told Real Raw News.
If all information is correct, the operation marks the second time in two years White Hats have freed captive children from either cargo ships or tankers near the California coast, a waypoint in the child sex trade industry. Real Raw News reported on a similar incident in November 2021.
On Saturday afternoon, an unknown tipster supplied the general’s office with near-real-time images of emaciated children standing shoulder-to-shoulder in what appeared to be the belly of a commercial tanker. One macabre picture showed barely clothed kids packed together like a tin of sardines. Some children had visible wounds on their arms, legs, faces, or torsos.
Gen. Smith’s experts validated the images’ metadata and identified the vessel as the Dubai Brilliance, a Marshall Islands-flagged supertanker anchored halfway between San Francisco and Alameda in San Francisco Bay. The 63,000-ton vessel was built in 2011 by Brilliance Maritime Inc., based in the United Arab Emirates. It can hold 20 million gallons of crude or, apparently, an unquantifiable number of children.
Public navigation logs show the vessel arrived in San Francisco on June 12, with no listed departure date; its most recent ports of call were Mongstad, Norway, Wilhelmshaven, Germany, and Skikda, Algeria—the latter of which, our source said, has a history of child trafficking.
After reviewing the images, Gen. Smith contacted his White Hat liaison at U.S. Navy WARCOM in Coronado, asking whether a team was available to investigate the claims.
Our source would not say how many SEALs or which team(s) took part in the rescue but admitted that a sizable force left Coronado due to the number of children allegedly held in captivity and the possibility of encountering hostiles on the ship. He added that a White Hat-aligned Coast Guard cutter was put on standby to aid in extraction.
After boarding the Dubai Brilliance at approximately 1:30 a.m., Sunday, the SEALs, without firing a single shot, neutralized nine armed goons, slitting their throats or garroting them.
They found kidnapped children in two parts of the ship, the oil hold compartments and the crew quarters. The scene in the hold mimicked what the SEALs had seen in the photographs, hundreds of terrified children, many malnourished, huddled together as if for warmth, crying so loudly their wails echoed off the hull. The SEALs estimated most kids were preteens, though some were barely old enough to walk. No children discovered in the hold were American, meaning the traffickers had put them aboard the ship at other ports of call, but the adolescents found locked in crew quarters were American citizens whom the kidnappers had brought to the boat while anchored in San Francisco Bay.
A twelve-year-old girl hugged her SEAL saviors, saying that “bad, dirty men” abducted her while she was riding a bicycle only a few yards from her doorstep in San Francisco.
The freshly kidnapped American children fared better than the foreigners in the hold; They hadn’t been confined long enough to sustain injuries or face starvation. The SEALs found 15 decaying corpses mixed among the living in the hold.
A rescue operation began immediately, and the SEALs and Coast Guard used skiffs and the cutter to expeditiously exfiltrate the tanker.
Our source would not quantify the exact number of children saved, but he said the Coast Guard made several round trips from Alameda to Dubai Brilliance.
The surviving foreign and domestic children, our source said, were brought to safety and are being identified so they can be returned to their proper families."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_290230,"The WEF has declared that all citizens must be implanted with a CBDC microchip in the very near future, in order to be able to fully participate in society and do basic things such as purchase food and water.

According to Professor Richard Werner, in the very near future citizens will “need to use the latest technology” such as a “CBDC chip implant” in order to access their bank accounts.

Professor Richard A. Werner is an economist and professor of banking and finance. He is known as the proponent of a new post-crisis monetary policy he called Quantitative Easing (“QE”) – which he proposed in Japan in 1995 as chief economist of a British investment bank.

He has also worked as a researcher at the University of Oxford, the Bank of Japan, the Development Bank of Japan, and the Asian Development Bank. He is involved in supporting the establishment of not-for-profit community banks through an initiative called Local First CIC.

Expose-news.com reports: At the Amsterdam Science Summit 2022, Prof Werner gave a lecture on central bank digital currencies (“CBDCs”) and the 2030 Agenda. At the sidelines of this year’s Amsterdam Science Summit, he spoke to Ivor Cummins about CBDCs and how high inflation has been orchestrated by central banks to further their agenda.

There are two aspects to QE monetary policies that Prof. Werner proposed: QE1 and QE2. QE1 is for the central bank to step in and purchase the non-performing assets in the banking system. The central bank buys up non-performing assets at face value and the problem is solved, banks have a strong balance sheet.  But that won’t be enough to get banks to increase credit. 

So, Prof. Werner proposed QE2 which allows the central bank to force the banks to create more money and push it into the economy. This would be accomplished with central banks buying assets, e.g., property, from the non-bank sectors.  The money the non-bank sectors receive from the sale of the property would then be deposited into the seller’s bank account.  When an economy is experiencing deflation, “that’s how central banks can push money into the economy directly,” Prof Werner explained.

QE1 was followed by Japan in the 1980s but the USA disallowed Japan subsequently using QE2.  And then out of the blue and at the wrong time, QE2 was adopted by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks in March 2020.  The intention of adopting QE2 at that time was to cause high inflation.  Why? To move economies onto a CBDC system.

“You have to think of CDBCs as a control system [or a permit system], not a currency,” Prof. Werner explained.

“It’s a conditional currency based on you actually getting that permit. Now, if you happen to be some kind of critic of government policy or a critic of central banks this could be difficult.  Or if you dare to step out of the 15-minute city zone, you know, maybe you’ll find that: ‘Oh [my CBDC is] not working’. Of course, these are things we’ve seen already in China. There’s plenty of videos where somebody tries to use it to buy a ticket and it doesn’t work because his social credit scores are low.”

And, effectively, there’s no real right to appeal.  With very few people controlling the very many, the controllers will use computers and algorithms to run the system.  If you appeal the blocking of CDBCs you’ll be dealing with automated responses.

Prof. Werner explained that the central planners, as he calls them, orchestrate inflation to cover up changes to banking systems.  For example, in the 1970s high inflation was orchestrated to cover up the move of the gold-backed US dollar to the petrodollar.  And the high inflation we’ve experienced in 2021/2022 has been orchestrated to cover up the move from the petrodollar to CBDCs.

In March 2020, the Federal Reserve and other key central banks adopted QE2, a recommendation for deflation or a shrinking economy.  In March 2020 economies weren’t shrinking but the Federal Reserve adopted QE2 and bought up assets from non-banks forcing banks to create credit.  It was very clear it was going to create inflation.  This was not an error in judgement, it was intentional, Prof Werner explained.  It’s a very specific policy that is very rarely taken.

Proof that this was a deliberate action, Prof Werner said, was that “just before covid in August 2019,  there was a conference in Jackson Hole of the annual Central Bankers conference but it invited BlackRock the big asset manager … and BlackRock made a proposal, they said ‘there will be another crisis … but this time we should create inflation’. They never explain why, they just say we must create inflation … and here’s how we’re going to do it and they cited my proposal without mentioning my name, of course.”

“And, there’s one more factor,” Prof Werner said, “the Federal Reserve hired Blackrock in March 2020 to buy assets … QE was for a deflationary situation but the way they were using it had to cause inflation, there was no doubt.  And they knew it because they even said it.”

“So, this [current] inflation is entirely intentionally created by the central banks, by the central planners. So how are we going to punish them for this? ‘Oh, let’s give them more powers, let’s give them unprecedented powers over everything, over life on Earth through central bank digital currencies.”

“The true reason I think why they wanted this inflation because that is to cover up, essentially, the disintegration of the petrodollar and move to the new system which they want to be CBDC based.”

At the moment there’s talk about CBDCs being used via phone-based apps. “Yes, that is the initial phase. But what was already ready around 2015, is the ultimate goal – what they really want, apparently, I was told by a Central Banker – is CBDC looks like a small grain of rice that they want to put under your skin, which is my view a violation of human dignity.  And they realise there is a hurdle to get people to accept this,” Prof. Werner said.

So, they’re using crises, disruption and unemployment to introduce universal basic income, to soften the public up to accepting a CBDC chip implanted under their skin.

“You will get 2 000 Euros into your account every month.  But of course, to run this efficiently [they’ll say:] ‘We need to use the latest technology so you need the CBDC chip implant’.”"

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_146838,"Hollywood actor Mark Wahlberg told hundreds of people at a Sunday school meeting in Los Angeles that a small yet powerful group of Hollywood insiders has declared war on the “evil” entertainment industry elite who traffic in children, and “Hollywood pedophiles have nowhere left to hide.”

“We are hunting these evil sons of bitches down and taking them out, one blood drinking pedophile at a time,” Wahlberg said, before warning the congregation to expect some disturbing news on the front page of newspapers in the near future.

According to Wahlberg, Hollywood is a huge network of pedophilia, child prostitution, and human trafficking that is controlled by “sick freaks” and there is a “culture of silence” in the industry because everybody understands that speaking out about elite pedophilia is punishable by death.

For this reason, Wahlberg says Jim Caviezel and Mel Gibson are “American heroes” with “balls of steel” for daring to take on the Hollywood system and play their part in raising awareness about the scourge of elite pedophilia in the entertainment industry.

Wahlberg has been a regular at various churches in Los Angeles in recent years, often attending mass twice on Sundays, and on July 2 he shared the moment he “woke up” to the reality of the Hollywood system with hundreds of church goers.
Describing an industry Christmas party featuring Hollywood executives from some of the most powerful studios in the world, Wahlberg said studio bosses, executive producers, international brokers, and financial stakeholders, as well as “two A-list stars,” engaged in Satanic rituals, which culminated in torture and sexual abuse of children.
According to Wahlberg, four Hollywood executives dressed in Satanic outfits and masks, who were all “drinking blood, high on adrenochrome”, encouraged him to “stop being a prude and join the club” by sexually abusing “two very, very young children.”
“I’m a father,” Wahlberg said, “and all I could think about was that these two children should have been safe at home with their parents. But they were in a Hollywood club, being preyed on by sadists, pedos, and sexual perverts who engage in the worst form of evil.”

Wahlberg meets with Gibson to discuss elite pedophilia in Hollywood

Wahlberg made clear that the consequences in Hollywood could not be higher for those who threaten to expose the depraved activities of the elites.
“Why didn’t I kill these guys? I had to think about my children. They are my first priority in this world – and I don’t want them to grow up without a father.”
Wahlberg said he had heard rumors about this type of party in Hollywood, and he knew the consumption of adrenochrome was a popular pastime among studio executives, but he had never been openly confronted with it before.
“The whole corrupt Hollywood system, all of the brainwashing and perversion they are pumping out every year, it all begins to make sense when you understand that Hollywood needs young blood to continue operating.”
Adrenochrome is a compound that occurs in the body and which spikes during periods of fear and anxiety. According to Wahlberg, Hollywood elites torture children to cause spikes in the chemical compound, before harvesting the chemical from their blood, which they then drink or inject in order to get high, and stay healthy and young.
After taking some time to contemplate his future, Wahlberg says it is now time to “right some wrongs.”
“The only way I can honor the children is to dedicate my life to eradicating this evil from the face of the earth,” said Wahlberg, who explained that his own children have urged him to speak out about the real nature of Hollywood.
The “good guys,” according to Wahlberg, are “recruiting in numbers”, and a “civil war” is threatening to erupt in Hollywood, bringing the whole system to its knees.
This allegation from Mark Wahlberg adds to the wave of accusations made by celebrities and musicians about the real nature of the entertainment industry elite. Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood have both gone on record exposing the pedophilia at the heart of Hollywood.

According to Elijah Wood, innocent young lives are destroyed to satisfy “people with parasitic interests” who “see you as their prey.” In an interview with the Sunday Times, Wood dropped a series of bombshells about the pedophiles that run the industry, noting that “Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized.”
If you read the Washington Post or watch CNN, pedophilia is not a problem, and those who talk about it are tinfoil hat wearing kooks sharing ‘fake news.’ But more and more stars are coming forward with similar stories about the depraved Hollywood and entertainment industry system.
Wahlberg has now dedicated his life to exposing the international pedophile ring that he says has corrupted Hollywood “to the core” and continues to “destroy the lives of innocent children, tearing families apart.”
Will you join him?"
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_773545,"President Joe Biden speaks in the South Court Auditorium at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 8, 2022. (Yuri Gripas/Abaca Press/TNS)

President Joe Biden’s Department of Justice quietly removed content on child sex trafficking from its website earlier this year.

The Justice Department’s website includes a page on child sex trafficking; however, that page has seen major revisions in recent months, including the complete removal of three sections:

International Sex Trafficking of Minors
Domestic Sex Trafficking of Minors
Child Victims of Prostitution
One of the deleted sections warned that sex trafficking can involve “the cross border transportation of children.”

“In these situations, traffickers recruit and transfer children across international borders in order to sexually exploit them in another country. The traffickers can be individuals working alone, organized crime groups, enterprises, or networks of criminals working together to traffic children into prostitution across country lines,” the section stated, according to the internet archive.

“This form of sex trafficking is a problem in the United States, and recovered victims originate from all over the world, including less-developed areas, such as South and Southeast Asia, Central America, and South America, to more developed areas, such as Western Europe,” the deleted portion continued.

“Once in the United States, a child may be trafficked to any or multiple states within the country. These victims are often trafficked far from home, and thrown into unfamiliar locations and culture. They may be given a false passport or other documentation to conceal their age and true identity. They may also struggle with the English language. All these factors make it extremely difficult for these children to come forward to law enforcement.”

The Biden administration’s sudden website changes come amid the ongoing border crisis that helps fuel human trafficking in the United States, according to experts.

“Slavery is alive and well today all across the world, and it comes in the form of human trafficking,” Texas Public Policy Foundation said.

U.S. immigration authorities encountered over 100,000 unaccompanied minors last year, an all-time high, according to CBS News.

“While some minors make it into the country with information on family members they have in the U.S., others end up in the foster system. According to the Department of State, a large number of child sex trafficking survivors in the U.S. were at one time in the foster care system,” Texas Public Policy Foundation added. “Being an immigrant places these children at a higher risk since they tend to have lower levels of education, an inability to speak English, and a lack of family and friends.”

Another deleted section formerly on the Justice Department’s website explained that child victims of prostitution are physically, emotionally and psychologically abused, and it is not uncommon for “pimps and traffickers” to “beat, rape, or torture” their child victims.

“Technological advances, in particular the Internet, have facilitated the commercial sexual exploitation of children by providing a convenient worldwide marketing channel. Individuals can now use websites to advertise, schedule, and purchase sexual encounters with minors.  The Internet and web-enabled cell phones also allow pimps and traffickers to reach a larger clientele base than in the past, which may expose victims to greater risks and dangers,” the deleted section adds."

The WEF urged world leaders to begin fast-tracking the implementation of CBDC’s during the “Summer Davos” event last week.

For years now the globalist elite have been telling us about their plans to seize control of every aspect of our lives and turn the world into a giant prison, but most people have preferred to cover their ears and pretend nothing is awry.

CBDCs are digital versions of national currencies, touted to bring about an efficient, secure, and accessible monetary system. But, in reality the digital currency will hand total financial control of people’s live over to central banks and governments.
According to the WEF, CBDCs must be urgently rolled out for many reasons including stopping Americans from keeping and bearing arms.
As the Second Amendment wisely states, a well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state, which is a state of affairs the WEF are determined to destroy.

The WEF has declared that all citizens must be implanted with a CBDC microchip in the very near future, in order to be able to fully participate in society and do basic things such as purchase food and water.
According to Professor Richard Werner, in the very near future citizens will “need to use the latest technology” such as a “CBDC chip implant” in order to access their bank accounts.
WEF-penetrated countries like Australia are heeding the global elite’s call for an embeddable CBDC and an urgent ban on cash.
Australian mainstream media has announced “we have taken a major step towards a cashless society” as major Australian banks refuse to honor cash withdrawals by customers.
The announcement came just days after the WEF announced that world governments must move towards a cashless and centralized system to track and control how citizens spend their money.

Australia is the testing ground for many WEF policies and Joe Biden is rapidly advancing plans to eliminate physical cash and ensure that Americans cannot own their own money.
And in the WEF-penetrated UK, Nigel Farage, the most prominent anti-globalist in the land, is already feeling the chilling effects of having banks dictate what he can and cannot say.
As the Telegraph reported:
“Nigel Farage, the Brexit Party leader-turned-TV presenter, has revealed that, after 40 years with the same bank, they have now written to him to announce that they are closing all of his accounts, without any reason given, leaving many to suspect that his apparently “controversial” views are to blame for their decision.
Do the elite really think we are going to sit here and let them impose on us their authoritarian plans for world domination without a fight? The short answer is yes, this is exactly what they expect of us.
We know the global elite expect us to roll over and accept their authoritarian hellscape because they are bragging about crushing our collective spirit with the Covid pandemic.
Praising the “billions” of people around the world who complied with the elite’s draconian Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, the WEF is claiming the same people will comply with social-credit schemes including restrictions on speech, dietary choices, and carbon allowances.
If this sounds far-fetched, we have the proof in black and white.
In an article titled ‘My Carbon’: An approach for inclusive and sustainable cities’ by Mridul Kaushik, the WEF admit that Covid-19 lockdowns were a “test” and restrictions were a humiliation ritual.

Writing that “COVID-19 was the test of social responsibility,” Kaushik commends how, “A huge number of unimaginable restrictions for public health were adopted by billions of citizens across the world.”
“There were numerous examples globally of maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, mass vaccinations and acceptance of contact-tracing applications for public health, which demonstrated the core of individual social responsibility,” he adds.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wasn’t joking when he warned us that Bill Gates and his cronies enjoy experimenting with the lives of those of us they deem “lesser humans.”
How do we know that a CBDC to control humanity is their goal? Because in recent years the Davos crowd have become so arrogant they can hardly disguise their excitement at their diabolical plans.
World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab called China a “role model” for other countries.
Many others in high places have repeated these sentiments. China is like a very creepy, real-life dystopian film. You literally cannot function in that country as a human being without a QR code and vaccines. Your face is constantly scanned, and your every move is tracked by various WeChat apps.
Everything you purchase in China is via a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and a QR code tied to your social credit account. Note that the U.S. is just months away from trialing its own pilot CBDC.
The “role model” country has public Jumbotron displays that instantly shame anyone it captures committing trivial infractions, including jaywalking. Your social credit is also downgraded as a result.
Chinese police stop people regularly on the street, take their phones, and search them for “illegal” VPNs, social media, and other banned apps. You’ll get arrested and sent to reeducation camps if you’re caught with anything you’re not supposed to have.
The elite are determined to roll out these authoritarian tactics in the US in the next few years. We know that China is dystopian hell. We cannot allow them to get away

The Netherlands is one of the most Davos-friendly nations in the world, and the current government has embraced Klaus Schwab’s vision of a depopulated world, by any means necessary.

Doctors in the Netherlands have been ordered to begin euthanizing citizens with autism and other minor disabilities, without fear of prosecution – even if the patient does not currently express any desire to die.

Around 40 people who identified as autistic or intellectually disabled were forcibly euthanized in the Netherlands between 2012 and 2021, according to a Kingston University investigation of Dutch euthanasia cases.

Autism rates are skyrocketing around the developed world, with many experts blaming the intensive vaccine schedule inflicted on the young and very young. According to the Dutch government, which pushes dozens of aluminum-laced vaccines on toddlers, euthanasia is the answer to the explosion in autism numbers.

Five people younger than 30 who were killed by doctors all had autism listed as the sole reason behind the decision to end their lives, the Kingston University study found.

There are also cases of the state euthanizing alcoholics, sex abuse victims, dementia and depression.

With these cases, experts have questioned whether the law allowing doctors to kill patients on behalf of the state via lethal injections has strayed too close to Third Reich Nazi-style eugenics programs.

Nypost report: Kasper Raus, an ethicist and public health professor at Belgium’s Ghent University, said the types of patients seeking out physician-assisted suicide have changed greatly over the past two decades in both the Netherlands and Belgium, where it is also legal.

When the Netherlands became the first country to legalize human euthanasia, the debate focused on people with cancer — not those with autism, Raus said.

Patients must meet strict requirements including suffering from an incurable illness that causes “unbearable” physical or mental anguish to be eligible for euthanasia — but doctors ultimately decide who qualifies.

In the roughly 10-year period the study focused on, nearly 60,000 people decided to die via euthanasia in the Netherlands, according to the Dutch government’s euthanasia review committee. Of those deaths, the committee has released documents and data on 900 cases in an effort of transparency.

Kingston University researchers looked at those 900 cases and found 39 of them had autism or an intellectual disability. Of the 39, 18 were younger than 50 years old.

Many of the patients cited a number of mental, physical and age-related ailments as the reason for ending their lives — including unbearable loneliness.

Eight people, however, named the sole cause of their suffering as factors related to their intellectual disability — such as social isolation, a lack of coping strategies, an inability to adjust to change or oversensitivity to stimuli.

One of the report’s main authors Irene Tuffrey-Wijne, a palliative care specialist at Kingston University, questioned the ethics of ending the lives of the autistic.

“There’s no doubt in my mind these people were suffering,” she said. “But is society really OK with sending this message, that there’s no other way to help them and it’s just better to be dead?”

One of the eight people cited in the study was an autistic man in his 20s. He reported feeling unhappy since childhood and was regularly bullied, according to his case notes.

The man “longed for social contacts but was unable to connect with others” and eventually decided he wanted to die because “having to live on this way for years was an abomination.”

Dutch psychiatrist Dr. Bram Sizzo was disturbed by the trend.

In a third of cases, Dutch doctors determined that there was “no prospect of improvement” for people with autism and intellectual disabilities, according to the study.

The director of Cambridge University’s Autism Research Centre, Simon Baron-Cohen, worried that people with such disabilities may not fully grasp the decision to end their lives. He called it “abhorrent” that they were not offered more support and were instead euthanized."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_588522,"Just a week following the unexpected and rather tragic death of their personal chef and friend, Tafari Campbell, the Obamas were spotted out and about, seemingly unscathed and unaffected.

Barack and Michelle Obama were spotted at the Vineyard Golf Club and Farm Neck Country Club, respectively, according to exclusive photos obtained by Daily Mail. The pictures are the first public glimpse of the Obamas since the loss of their dear friend and personal chef.

Dressed in a green polo shirt and white shorts, Barack Obama was seen engaged in a round of golf at the exclusive Vineyard Golf Club. The former president, noticeably bearing bandaged fingers, which causes speculations online.

Citizen journalist Travis of Flint, Michigan wrote, “just days after his personal chef and friend died in a very mysterious paddle boarding accident, Barack Obama appears to have injured fingers and a black eye. We still don’t know who the other person was and Obama loves paddle boarding. I think we can all guess what happened at this point!”

Michelle, on the other hand, was involved in a high-intensity tennis game with three of her friends at the nearby Farm Neck Country Club.

The reason for the tragic death of Tafari Campbell remains a mystery.

The Gateway Pundit previously reported that Martha’s Vineyard law enforcement appears to have left a significant void in the details surrounding the tragic drowning of Obama’s private chef, Tafari Campbell.

The call log of the 911 distress call, received on the night of the accident, conspicuously omits the reason for the call.

Tafari Campbell, 45, met his tragic end while paddle boarding on Great Edgartown Pond, Martha’s Vineyard, on Sunday night. He was reportedly not alone, but local police have yet to disclose the other person’s identity.

Police confirmed Campbell was visiting Martha’s Vineyard and was employed by the Obamas at the time of his death. Barack and Michelle Obama were not present at their home but were in town when the incident occurred.

On the night of the incident, the Edgartown Police Department’s logs confirm the receipt of a 911 distress call at precisely 7:46 pm, reporting the 45-year-old struggling to stay afloat on the surface before he drowned.

Oddly, the call log shows the reason for this call as BLANK – an inconsistency, considering that all other calls made that night had their reasons clearly mentioned.

Dispatch calls between Martha’s Vineyard emergency services confirm the presence of a second paddle boarder with Campbell.

According to a statement from the Massachusetts State Police reported by MassLive, the unidentified paddleboarder tried to swim to Campbell but tragically, “did not reach him in time.”

After the failed rescue attempt, the individual managed to swim back to shore and alerted someone who then called 911.

A female made the initial 911 call, who, as of 8:18 pm, was actively searching for Campbell on a boat, per Daily Mail.

Adding to the mystery, the call’s origin was marked as Wilson’s Landing, a popular paddle board launch site roughly two miles from the Obama residence on Turkeyland Cove. This information contradicts the Massachusetts State Police records, stating that the first call originated from the Obamas’ residence.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_386250,"The daughter of World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab has boasted that permanent ‘climate lockdowns’ are coming, whether people like it or not.

According to Nicole Schwab, the COVID pandemic was a “tremendous opportunity” to test how the public would comply with the WEF’s plans to usher in their Great Reset agenda.

The WEF’s promotion of the “climate emergency” narrative seeks to “create a change that is not incremental…to position nature at the core of the economy,” according to Schwab’s offspring.

Nicole Schwab made the admission in a newly unearthed video that was recorded during a WEF panel discussion back in 2020.

The WEF lists Nicole Schwab as a “Member of the Executive Committee” of the WEF who is also the co-director of Platform to Accelerate Nature-Based Solutions & 1t.org.

The group of WEF attendees were discussing how the fake threat of an “immediate emergency” can be used to further advance the WEF’s “Great Reset” plan for humanity.

“This [COVID] crisis has shown us that first of all, things can shift very rapidly when we put our minds to it and when we feel the immediate emergency to our livelihoods,” Nicole Schwab declares.

“And second, that clearly the system, I mean, you mentioned it earlier, that we had before is not sustainable.”

“So I see it as a tremendous opportunity to really have this Great Reset and to use this huge flows of money — to use the increased levers that policymakers have today — in a way that was not possible before to create a change that is not incremental but that we can look back and we can say this is the moment where we really started to position nature at the core of the economy.”

“Taking the point of view of business and economy and looking at where are there opportunities to create jobs and regenerate nature?”

“And there are plenty of opportunities and this is again a mindset of actually innovation technology and a business growth can happen with a positive impact of nature and kind of laying out some of these examples.”

“Regenerative agriculture is, of course, a huge part of that as well,” Schwab continued.

“And one of the key reflection points here is also around engaging youth, and for me, it’s again, I come back to this shift in the mindset of the restoration generation can we conceive of ourselves as humans?”

“I mean, you talked about a new humanity, I think you mentioned it right?”

“Can we conceive of ourselves as a restoration generation?”

“I think that’s where we need to go.”

“I’m also hopeful that it’s possible, but I think it will take a lot of will, both political will but also in terms of the business actors, to break with business as usual but in a very serious way and to say we need to make very difficult choices.”

“There are trade-offs but this is our chance and other, and this is about risk, and it’s about resilience because the shocks are coming are going to be even worse if we don’t do it now.”

WATCH:

Slaynews.com reports: The WEF has been pushing the idea of “climate lockdowns” since Covid first emerged.

In an article published by the WEF, the organization lauds how “billions” of people complied with Covid “restrictions.”

The unelected organization continues by arguing that the public would do the same under the guise of reducing “carbon emissions.”

Titled “My Carbon: An approach for inclusive and sustainable cities,” the article suggests that the same fear tactics could be used to impose further “restrictions” on the general public.

The subject of the piece is how to convince people to adopt “personal carbon allowance programs.”

Schwab’s group notes that improvements in tracking and surveillance technology are helping to overcome “political resistance” against such programs.

“COVID-19 was the test of social responsibility,” the article notes.

It continues by commending how “a huge number of unimaginable restrictions for public health were adopted by billions of citizens across the world.”

“There were numerous examples globally of maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, mass vaccinations, and acceptance of contact-tracing applications for public health, which demonstrated the core of individual social responsibility,” the WEF adds.

The organization goes on to cite how so many people complied with lockdown mandates, despite overwhelming evidence of the harmful consequences such restrictions had on society.

The WEF then implies that the public would behave in a similarly obsequious manner in other areas of life."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_2315,"As alpha-gal syndrome (AGS), a tick-borne disease that triggers an allergic reaction to red meat, sees a steep rise in cases, eyebrows are being raised over a coincidental alignment with research funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

AGS, first reported in Virginia in 2008, has seen an alarming increase over the past few years. According to a recent press release from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 450,000 people in the U.S. have tested positive for alpha-gal since 2010.

In 2021, the number of positive test results for AGS surged by 41.3% compared to 2017, and testing for alpha-gal peaked at 66,106 persons that year.

The same year, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced a significant grant of $1,469,352 toward research into the Rhipicephalus microplus (“Asian blue”) tick. This tick is known to cause AGS, as verified by a publication in the ImmunoTargets and Therapy journal found in the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM).

The grant was channeled to Oxitec Ltd., a biotechnology company that genetically modified male ticks to carry a “self-limiting gene,” intending to control the tick population by releasing these engineered ticks to mate with wild females in high-infestation areas. Oxitec’s project purportedly aimed to address the global pest problem affecting cattle, a significant source of red meat.

In June 2023, after Oxitec reported high efficacy in its tick experimentation, the Gates Foundation provided an additional $4.8 million in funding.

However, the intertwining of Gates’s interests and this rise in AGS cases is drawing scrutiny. Gates holds stakes in pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer Inc. that produce antibiotics such as doxycycline, commonly used to treat tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease. Moreover, in 2017, his foundation granted over $1 million to Ceres Nanosciences, a diagnostics company specializing in Lyme disease detection.

In the food industry, Gates has significant investments in plant-based and lab-grown meat companies. He has backed companies such as Upside Foods, Good Meat, Beyond Meat, and Impossible Foods, some of which which have been approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the production and sale of meat substitute products.

While there is no definitive evidence linking Gates’s funding of tick research to the rise in AGS cases, the timing and the complexity of his interests have led to a growing call for more transparency and accountability.

But this isn’t the first time that Gates’s involvement in disease research and prevention has caused controversy. A similar series of events unfolded when Gates focused on malaria, a disease eradicated in the United States for decades, until recent developments.

Malaria was last detected in the U.S. back in 2003 when seven people in Palm Beach County were infected, as per the CDC. Fast forward to 2007, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation turned its sights on malaria research, subsequently pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the cause, and increasing their malaria budget by 30% in 2014.

In a significant development, in July 2018, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) launched Krintafel (tafenoquine), a new treatment for Plasmodium vivax malaria. This marked the first new treatment for the disease in over six decades. Gates Foundation funding was pivotal in the drug’s development, a fact corroborated by Forbes. The Foundation continued to invest in tafenoquine research, backing various studies, including a Lancet-published article praising the drug’s performance.

Meanwhile, in 2019, the Foundation backed the “Injectable Artesunate Assessment Report,” establishing the efficacy of injectable artesunate, a malaria vaccine.

Notably, in September 2020, the Gates Foundation granted over $1.3 million to Oxitec Ltd., the same company involved in the aforementioned genetically engineered tick research, for “mosquito field trials.” These trials involved the release of genetically engineered Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, known vectors of diseases including malaria, into Florida and Texas following EPA approval in March 2022.

This move sparked outrage from locals who voiced concerns about being turned into “guinea pigs” for this “criminal” experiment, according to Florida resident Meagan Hull. Councilman Mark Gregg likened the GMO mosquitoes to “Frankenstein bugs.”

Fast forward to March 2023, and FFF Enterprises, a specialty vaccine distributor, announced it would start stocking the Gates-backed artesunate vaccine. Three months later, in June 2023, the CDC issued an alert about locally acquired malaria cases in Florida and Texas. Interestingly, the CDC, funded by the Gates Foundation, recommended rapid access to the artesunate vaccine.

As these series of events involving alpha-gal syndrome and malaria unfold, parallels can be drawn in the timing of the Gates Foundation’s funding and subsequent disease outbreaks. Though direct causality hasn’t been established, the correlation has led to calls for more in-depth investigations and heightened accountability. Transparency about these ties is paramount to alleviate public concerns and ensure ethical practices in disease prevention and treatment."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_182701,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has banned 5G towers in the Russian Federation amid concerns the technology is medically unsafe and has caused the deaths of school children near St. Petersburg.
Discussions over the adverse effects of 5G are not new. For over a decade, alternative media have linked technology to myriad health issues, including immunosuppressive diseases and virus replication, the specifics of which are beyond the scope of this website and the author’s knowledge. However, Putin’s pledge to dismantle existing 5G super towers shows the hazards of electromagnetic radiation are rooted more in fact than conspiracy.
Unlike the U.S. and the West, Russia did not start erecting towers overnight when the technology, developed by Qualcomm and the mobile ecosystem, became available in 2015. Since then, the telecom companies in the U.S. have built 150,000 towers; by comparison, Russia had only 22, primarily in Moscow.
During the Plandemic, with schools shuttered, mobile providers in the U.S. accelerated construction of towers within a stone’s throw of elementary schools nationwide. When schools reopened, students suddenly saw sprawling 5G dishes on the horizon and atop school roofs.
Among the four major mobile operators in Russia—MTS, Megafon, Rostelcom, and Vimpel-Communications Public Joint Stock—only MTS started limited deployment of 5G in 2021, placing towers in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk, Russia’s most populous cities, with a single tower 15 meters from an elementary school playground in the outskirts of St. Petersburg.
In April 2023, 16 students experienced severe side effects of what Vladimir Putin has called electromagnetic poisoning. Early symptoms included spontaneous vomiting, dizziness, tinnitus, intolerable headaches, and abdominal inflammation. Later symptoms were gastrointestinal bleeding, cerebral hemorrhaging, and blindness due to the decay of ocular nerves. The affected children were ages 8-12 and had attended school the same semester. Moreover, the sick kids were unvaccinated, so health officials at Russia’s Ministry of Health ruled out Covid-19 vaccine side effects. Comprehensive bloodwork and radiological imaging tests ruled out preexisting maladies, foodborne ailments, medications, and biological and chemical agents. By June 6, 2023, 11 of the 16 students had died.
Health Minister Mikhail Murashko, with the aid of the Ministry of Defense, ordered an inspection team to evaluate transmission frequencies emanating from the cell tower, which, they deduced, pulsed electromagnetic waves in the 24-50 gigahertz range near the bottom of the millimeter wave scale. Regulatory bodies and telecommunication firms worldwide have declared that range safe to humans, with former president Obama’s FCC Director Tom Wheeler having said in 2016, “5G poses no threat whatsoever to people, wildlife, or pets. Anyone questioning its safety is promoting baseless conspiracies.”
However, Putin attributed the 2023 fatalities to a common denominator—the encroachment of 5G on Russian soil.
In mid-July, the Russian president met with many telecom executives and health experts to discuss the dangers inherent in the proliferation of 5G tech. He showed them images of dead children; one’s brain had liquified. He informed them he intended to enforce a moratorium on 5G research and demolish all towers in the Russian Federation.
His mandate wasn’t well-received by the Telecom executives. MTS Vice President of 5G Infrastructure Borya Vlasov said the absence of 5G would put Russia at a technological disadvantage, adding that Russia needed 5G to strengthen a once-thriving economy now faltering thanks to Putin’s actions in Ukraine. Putin spread images of the dead and sick children on a conference table, reportedly saying, “What about them? What has your 5G done to them?”
“We can’t blame 5G for this. Our comrades in the West agree that 5G is safe,” Vlasov said.
Putin ordered the security agent beside him to shoot Vlasov squarely between the eyes. Without hesitation, the agent drew his Makarov pistol and put a bullet in Vlasov’s forehead in full view of 15 people.
A week later, the Engineer Troops of the Russian Federation, a military administrative corps of the Ground Forces of the Russian Federation designed to perform military engineering operations, began decommissioning 5G cellular towers in Moscow. Pedestrians cheered as the monolithic towers came crashing down.
As of this writing, Russia has eliminated all its 5G towers.
The information in this article comes thanks to FSB Agent Andrei Zakharov, who in 2022 supplied Real Raw News with the real reasons behind Vladimir Putin’s Special Operation in Ukraine—to rid Eastern Europe of foreign Biolabs, pedophile rings, and Adrenochrome laboratories. Those battles are still being fought."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_142009,"The United Nations has warned Christians that if they do not fully embrace the legalization of pedophilia, they will be excluded from participating in society.

In a disturbing new declaration, UN expert Victor Madrigal-Borloz says religious freedom can only be tolerated if religious people fully embrace the globalist agenda, including radical LGBTQ+ ideology.

The LGBTQ+ ideology the UN is pushing originates from a report issued earlier this year that calls for the decriminalization of sex between adults and minors.

Madrigal-Borloz reported to the 53rd Session of the U.N. Human Rights Council that religious freedom can only exist if it is “compatible” with the LGBTQ+ agenda if Christians and other religious groups comply with radical far-left ideology.

“Paying attention to the voices and practices of inclusive communities can help to shift narratives claiming that the exercise of freedom of religion or belief is incompatible with the equal enjoyment of human rights by LGBT persons,” Madrigal-Borloz told the UN.

Slaynews.com reports: Madrigal-Borloz declared that the fix for religions that are “incompatible” with radical ideology is to have religious communities re-interpret their own doctrines to meet his preferences.

According to Madrigal-Borloz, religious beliefs, and traditions must become subservient to LGBT ideology and the UN agenda.

“In some cases, religious narratives have been deliberately used to justify violence and discrimination — often in defiance of the doctrine of those faiths, and also beyond the scope of the right freedom of religion or belief,” he complained.

The Stand explained that adhering to Madrigal-Borloz’s ideas would mean abandoning core religious beliefs.

“So, now if we hold to biblical truth, we are apparently just misinterpreting our own doctrines,” the outlet notes.

He insinuates that religious believers who do not embrace the LGBT ideology are misinterpreting their own religion.

Madrigal-Borloz also cited concern about those people who are interpreting religious doctrines that place homosexuality “within a discourse of immorality and sin.”

He suggested such comments about LGBT lifestyles and sin “can be considered hate speech or even incitement to violence.”

He lashed out as nations, like Hungary, have banned same-sex duos from adopting children.

Madrigal-Borloz continued, “The concept of a ‘natural’ order as the guiding principle of human and social existence is also present in conservative doctrine.”

In what appears to be an open attack on religious freedom, Madrigal-Borloz’s report blasts “exemptions” for organizations such as foster care and adoption agencies that allow them to follow their biblical faith in their custody decisions.

He charged the world with “obligations” to submit to the LGBT belief system.

“[I]t is not permissible for individuals or groups to invoke ‘religious liberty’ to perpetuate discrimination against … lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex persons when it comes to the provision of goods or services in the public sphere,” Madrigal-Borloz’s report said.

He pointed to several cases in the U.S. where wedding vendors have declined demands to violate their faith by promoting same-sex unions.

Madrigal-Borloz also insists that LGBT people must be allowed to participate in religious communities despite their “exclusionary practices.”

“It is inappropriate for a U.N. expert to suggest that religious communities should change their beliefs and practices in order to benefit those who wish to violate religious tenets and still identify with a given faith,” the Stand argues."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_995407,"On October 8, 2020. only one month before the 2020 general election, Muskegon, MI City Clerk Ann Meisch noticed a black female (whose name was redacted from the police report), dropping off between 8,000-10,000 completed voter registration applications at the city clerk’s office.
The Muskegon Police Department was contacted and asked to investigate. On 10/21/20 First Lieutenant Mike Anderson was contacted by Tom Fabus, Chief of Investigations for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s Office. According to the MI State Police report, Mr. Fabus asked for Michigan State Police assistance with a joint investigation of alleged voter fraud being conducted by the Muskegon Police Department and the AG.
An investigative task force was formed, and an investigation was initiated.
The following is from the MI State Police report:
On 10/16/20 Muskegon City Clerk Ann Meisch and Deputy Clerk Kimberly Young contacted the Muskegon Police Department after noticing irregularities in voter registration applications received both in person and by mail.
The Muskegon city clerk became suspicious when the female, (whose name is redacted in the first part of the police report, but then later, is unredacted), hand-delivered thousands of voter registrations to her office, many of them in the same handwriting.
Later in the report, the name of the female suspect was unredacted.
The MI State Police investigator assigned to the case spoke with the female suspect who explained that she was being paid $1150/week “to find un-registered voters and provide them with a form so they can get registered to vote or obtain their absentee ballot.” The only problem is, the handwriting on the voter registrations was the same on several of the registrations and many of the addresses were non-existent or fake. 
MI Attorney General Dana Nessel, who is currently attempting to prosecute 15 senior citizens and the former MI GOP co-chair for casting an alternate set of electoral votes in the 2020 election, asked the MI State Police to join the Muskegon Police and AG’s investigation of the potentially massive, multi-city voter fraud operation.
Two members of AG Dana Nessel’s Criminal Investigation Division were assigned to the operation, yet curiously, she failed to mention the investigation to the public. To this day, Dana Nessel is still claiming there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Michigan, despite the fact that she knew her office and the office of her friend, Michigan’s crooked SOS Jocelyn Benson, were involved with the MI State Police in a large scale investigation that took place across the state before it was taken over by the FBI.

Corey Ames, a MI SOS analyst CONFIRMED “a quantity of the forms they found in their investigation “are clearly fraudulent.” MI SOS Jocelyn Benson also claimed there was no widespread voter fraud in Michigan and neglected to mention the investigation to the public.

Today, The Gateway Pundit and our close friends from Michigan are exposing this damning report. The evidence from this investigation exposes criminal election fraud involving thousands of fraudulent ballots in Michigan by an organization that set up temporary offices in several swing states prior to the 2020 election. 

This explosive investigation was covered up and buried from the public, until today.
It should be noted that after documenting these crimes and investigating for weeks, the Michigan police turned their investigation over to the FBI who promptly buried the findings. Once again, the FBI apparently took no action—more on that in an upcoming report.
The police in Muskegon were investigating voter fraud in October 2020, a month prior to the general election.  The FBI failed to follow-up on the alleged election crimes according to Michigan election investigator Phil O’Halloran. O’Halloran is now the Election Integrity Chair of the Michigan Republican Party.
The police report has redactions throughout, but not all names were redacted. The police report names ‘GBI Strategies‘ as the organization running the scheme. The Tennessee-based group is heavily connected to the Biden campaign and various Democrat campaign committees. The released report also names “Brilus” as a primary person involved.
The police report from 2020 revealed that GBI Strategies has been in operation since 2014. And, the investigators found that GBI Strategies was paid $1,571,386 by the Doug Jones for Senate campaign back in 2018. That was just one race they were involved in.
The investigators also found that GBI Strategies was paid $188,000 by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2018. (paragraph 11)

The employees at GBI Strategies were being paid $15 an hour or $120 a day.   (paragraph 8)

A woman interviewed by police said she was paid $1150 per week and given a rental car.  She said she was given a “reloadable pay card.” (paragraph 3)
Police reported that hundreds of pre-paid cards from “different” companies, along with “dozens of new (burner?) phones were found in the Southfield raid in Michigan.

The police report noted that there were numerous job openings listed in Flint, Michigan and Regional Field Manager postings in Washington DC and Chicago, Illinois. This group had branches across the nation.
During their investigation, the police also found partially completed voter registration forms and police found “pelican cases in the room with semi-automatic rifles joined with suppressors and optics and customized pistols.” One case had “4 rifles and 4 pistols.”

The police report claims these weapons were determined to be legal and lawful after calling in the ATF to inspect the weapons.
The affiant (witness who filled out the affidavit) first witnessed minivans moving from a hotel in Grand Haven to the location of the business, a former California Eyecare location. The next day Detective Luker was notified. He went to the address where he found a bag of trash filled with information on employee agreements.

The affiant believed the records found at the location were crucial to determining the crime of Election Fraud Forgery and determining who may be criminally liable and who may have profited from the fraud.

The affiant later obtained a copy of the Mukegon PD Report 2020-19124 authored by Officer Foster with a supplemental report by Detective Logan Anderson along with a copy of the search warrant of the business location.
This next paragraph from the police document reveals that Muskegon City Clerk Ann Meisch and Deputy Clerk Kimberly Young first contacted the police on October 16, 2020.
Meisch and Young contacted police after receiving multiple “State of Michigan Voter Registration Application” forms which in their opinion appeared to be fraudulent. According to the report, Meisch based her opinion on the fact that some of the addresses on the applications appeared to be invalid or non-existent. Also, some of the phone numbers were invalid and some signatures did match those on file.
Meisch also noted that the handwriting on the ballots appeared to be the same with a similar signature and ALL OF THE BALLOTS appeared to come from the same company with two locations in Southfield and Auburn Hills.
Meisch told police some of the forms were dropped off in person to the Muskegon City Clerk’s office by a black female who identified herself as Brianna Hawkins. Miss Hawkins said her employment entailed registering voters and helping them obtain absentee ballots.
Meisch estimated that the leftist organization delivered approximately 8,000-10,000 voter registration forms to the Muskegon City Clerk’s office and provided a sampling of 42 suspected fraudulent applications to Officer Foster for examination. Meisch stated they identified by viewing her Facebook profile.
Employee Brianna Hawkins dropped off between 8K -10K registrations in ONE day!

The investigators found that “a number of voter applications forms were clearly fraudulent.”

The report notes that police found, “Dozens of new phones” and “Hundreds of pre-paid payment cards” – these items were clearly considered suspicious by the police in the report.
Also in the report: the left-wing ballot organizing group had suppressors (Silencers) and automatic weapons for some odd reason.
Nearly three years later, President Trump faces multiple prosecutions because he ‘fraudulently’ pursued ‘baseless’ claims of voter fraud according to prosecutors and the mainstream media. Trump won the Michigan vote in 2016 by 15,000 votes but suspiciously lost to Joe Biden by 150,000 votes four years later, despite increasing his vote share in neighboring Ohio. 16 Trump Presidential electors in Michigan are being prosecuted by far-left Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, because, according to Dana Nessel the controversial Michigan AG, they ‘fraudulently’ believed that there was systemic voter fraud that was not being properly investigated.
The released police report has redactions throughout, but not all names were redacted. The police report names ‘GBI Strategies‘ as the organization engaged in what the report suggests is widespread, systemic, voter fraud in multiple locations around the state. The Tennessee group is heavily connected to the Biden campaign and various Democrat campaign committees. The released report also names “Brilus” as a primary person involved.
The police report also notes that the organization used rental cars around the state as part of its deployments, naming several of the field locations for their operations. On election night, a suspicious 3:30 AM van delivering the Biden Ballot Dump in Detroit at the facility formerly known as the TCF Center was accompanied by a vehicle registered to a rental car company.
The Gateway Pundit previously obtained the video and broke the story.

The Gateway Pundit has always reported that there were unanswered statistical anomolies within the absentee data. Repeated trends across the state of Michigan that appear to show systemic voter fraud among absentee ballots.
Michigan State Senator Ruth Johnson, who is a former Secretary of State, told the Gateway Pundit: “My estimate is over 800,000 ballot applications were sent to non-qualified voters in Michigan, including many individuals who moved or died, and even some individuals who were underage or non-citizens. Many were sent to people who had moved out of state.” These ballot applications, if turned back in, would cause a live ballot to then be sent to that address by the clerk. Both the ballot applications and the live ballots were not seriously checked for a ‘signature match’ because Democrat Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson purposefully advised clerks to illegally assume and presume the signatures were a match.
This tip from Muskegon clerk Ann Meisch, who has been the City Clerk of Muskegon since 2007, was referred to the FBI. Clerk Meisch has been a City Clerk for other Michigan cities for 17 years before that. There’s no evidence the FBI did anything with this investigation. And in fact, the Bill Barr appointed DOJ attorney overseeing election fraud cases was notorious for political persecution against conservatives.
We have more coming on our investigation. Stay tuned.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_907609,"Anthony Fauci has reemerged from retirement and urged the Biden administration to implement a “strict lockdown” this winter for all unvaccinated Americans.

The disgraced government bureaucrat appeared at a university virtual event recently titled, “Pandemic Lessons and Role of Faculty in Pandemic Preparedness with Dr. Anthony Fauci.”

During the appearance Fauci made it clear that he supports locking down and punishing those in society who are not yet vaccinated.

Dossier.today reports: I’ll save you 40 minutes of your life and quote some of the “highlights” from the interview, in which a Wayne State University professor asks Fauci about what he’s learned from his time overseeing a “pandemic response.” The video of the chat is available via YouTube below:

Fauci falsely claimed that New York City was overrun and had “cooler trucks outside because they had no places to put the bodies.”

“You had to have something to immediately shut down the tsunami of infection,” he states, adding, “that lockdown was absolutely justified.”

“Lockdown has a purpose,” the pseudoscientist continued. “One of the purposes, if you don’t have a vaccine, it’s to get more ventilators, get the hospitals better prepared … until you decompress the pressure on the hospitals.

Fauci wasn’t done yet. Here comes the truly evil insanity…

“If you have a vaccine available, you might want to lock down temporarily so you can get everybody vaccinated,” he suggests.

Rejecting the idea that lockdowns are a moral question, he added that “lockdowns have a place, but they are not a permanent solution.”

The conversation continued, with the longtime NIAID chief declaring that “climate change” is “playing a role” in causing outbreaks.

He then calls for an “international commitment to decrease the carbon imprint in society so you don’t have the kinds of crazy weather we’re having in this country.”

Yes, that’s a real quote.

He went on to blame the tragedy in Maui on climate change. “It’s completely, really amazing what’s happened with climate change,” he concludes."

Despite the legions of people who have died suddenly or suffered devastating health consequences, Bill Gates and the globalists are touting the mRNA Covid jabs as a huge success.

According to Big Pharma executives “there is a coming tsunami of mRNA medicines” including for heart disease and cancer, which just so happen to be the two main problems caused by mRNA jabs in the first place.

Join us as we expose those responsible for this crime against humanity and help us spread the word so their wicked plans do not come to fruition.

Instead of being hauled before international tribunal for crimes against humanity, the globalist elite are lording it over the masses, boasting that the lockdowns, face masks, and forced jabs of Covid was just the beginning.
Anthony Fauci emerged from the shadows this week to declare that unvaccinated people must be locked down this winter.
During an appearance at Georgetown University, Fauci made it clear that he supports locking down and punishing those in society who are not yet vaccinated.
Big Pharma executives are singing from the same hymn sheet, declaring that anybody who dares to refuse their mRNA jabs in future should be punished by exclusion from society.
And in case you were wondering, Big Pharma have literally hundreds – yes hundreds – of different mRNA jabs on the production line right now.
“There is a coming tsunami of mRNA medicines,” according to Melissa J. Moore, Moderna’s chief scientific officer. Watch:

If that wasn’t disturbing enough, Moderna’s chief scientific officer also boasted that Big Pharma will soon be injecting mRNA straight into people’s hearts. Yes, she’s talking about the same hearts that were healthy until the vaccine roll out caused millions of people all over the world, including fit and healthy young people and elite athletes, to keel over with heart problems.
And don’t worry about the millions of cases of turbo cancer caused by mRNA around the world. Big Pharma have an answer for that too. That’s right, more mRNA.
That’s right, the elite are now admitting they created the experimental jab in one hour, and trying to convince the masses that is something to be proud of.
We really are living in Orwell’s world now. War is peace. Ignorance is strength. Pedophilia is normal. And vaccines created in one hour are nothing to be worried about.
Make no mistake, the global elite are licking their lips about the hundreds of mRNA vaccines in the pipeline. At this year’s Davos summit, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair boasted that the “slew of new injectables and vaccines” will give the WEF the opportunity to change the world.
Watch as the notorious globalist struggles to maintain a straight face while promising the new injectables will be for the world’s benefit.

The elites weren’t counting on humanity waking up to their evil agenda.
As soon as it became clear that a significant percentage of the population was too smart to get vaccinated, they had to work on cunning alternatives schemes to force their jabs on us.
Reporting on the globalist elite is a full time job because, as the Bible tells us, wicked doesn’t sleep.
Take Bill Gates as a case in point. Rather than admitting that humanity has woken up to the truth about the disastrous Covid-19 jabs, Gates, who is not a doctor, is doubling down and taking it upon himself to vaccinate the world by stealth.
According to the billionaire eugenicist, farm animals including cows, pigs and chickens have inadequate genetics. And the only way to “fix” those genetics is to “vaccinate” every farm animal in the world with new mRNA vaccines that will find their way onto your family’s dinner plates.
That’s right, Bill Gates, American’s largest owner of farmland, has boasted that he is slipping mRNA into the food supply.
World Economic Forum-infiltrated countries like Australia are signing up to Bill Gates new scheme, desperate to force-jab the non-compliant in their country.
But Gates isn’t resting on his laurels. His laser-like focus to vaccinate the entire world, whether they comply or not, has also led to him investing hundreds of millions of dollars in genetically modified mosquitoes designed to operate as “flying vaccinators.”
And if this sounds far-fetched, you should be aware that the NIH is already vaccinating humans using Gates’ mosquitoes.
According to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., anyone who is prepared to allow Bill Gates to dictate world and US health policy should take a long, hard look at his record in Africa.
“Perhaps millions of children have died unnecessarily,” according Kennedy Jr., who shared information from a peer-reviewed publication in a respected journal.
“Anyone defending Bill Gates & WHO needs to explain Morgensen et al 2017.“
“This is a peer-reviewed publication in a respected journal by leading scientists describing outcomes akin to genocide,” said Kennedy Jr.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also slammed Gates and his “messianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology.” 
Speaking of false messiahs, the World Economic Forum let slip that they are hatching plans to vaccinate us through the water supply.
We can’t allow these globalists and Biotech companies to get away with murder. Given that we know the elite are determined to depopulate the world, it’s time to draw a line in the sand.
As Kennedy Jr stated, this is starting to look unmistakably like genocide.
Here at the People’s Voice, we are determined to expose the crimes of the elite and bring them to justice. But we can’t do it alone. We need your help to spread the truth far and wide.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_799295,"Fourteen major American cities  signed onto a globalist climate agreement with a truly dystopian goal for the country’s immediate future that includes eliminating meat and dairy consumption, private vehicle ownership, air travel, and clothing purchases. According to a report by The Federalist, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group plans to accomplish this vision by 2030—and Austin, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, San Francisco, Washington, DC, and Seattle are all on board.

The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group was first created in 2005 by London Mayor Ken Livingston and representatives from 18 megacities around the world to reduce climate pollution. The organization, at that time called the C20, merged with the Clinton Climate Initiative the following year, bringing its membership up to 40. In the decades since then, the group has expanded to include 96 cities, representing one-twelfth of the global population and 25% of the global economy.

The C40 is now chaired by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, with Democrat billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg serving as its president and primary financial backer—and like all globalist climate initiatives, it threatens to be a disaster for modern society.

The C40’s climate goals are laid out plainly in a 2019 report entitled “The Future of Urban Consumption in a 1.5°C World,” which was reemphasized in 2023. The report detailed the organization’s “ambitious target” of cutting consumption-based carbon emissions by “at least 50% by 2030.” In order to accomplish this, the C40 identified six sectors where “rapid action” is recommended: food, construction, clothing, vehicles, aviation, and electronics.

The ultimate goal, according to the report, is “0 kg of meat consumption,” “0 kg of dairy consumption,” “3 new clothing items per year,” “0 private vehicles,” and “1 short-haul return flight (less than 1,500 km) every three years” per person.

Despite so-called fact-checks from mainstream media claiming that these “targets” do not constitute real policy recommendations, C40 cities across the United States have followed in lockstep with the agenda. Earlier this year, New York City Mayor Eric Adams placed restrictions on the meat and dairy products served by public institutions. California, meanwhile, has been at the forefront of the push for electric vehicles. At the same time, in Europe, the UK banned the sale of new gas vehicles after 2030 and France banned short-haul air travel.

Equally concerning is the fact that the globalist World Economic Forum promotes the C40 agenda on its website, maintaining its goals of a Great Reset…

“You Will Own Nothing, and You Will Be Happy.”

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_534713,"The CDC has just quietly admitted that over 99% of reported “Covid deaths” were faked in order to scare the public into taking the experimental Covid jab.

Newly released data from the CDC reveals that most recorded fatalities that were blanket-blamed on Covid were caused by something else.

According to the CDC’s Covid dashboard, just 1.7% of the 324 “Covid deaths” registered in the week ending August 19 had Covid as the primary cause of death.

Disturbingly, the vast majority of people who were labeled as “Covid deaths” actually died of other causes such as cancer and heart disease – many of which could have been caused by the Covid jab itself.
Slaynews.com reports: Separate data from the agency shows that, so far in August, the largest cause of death in the U.S. has been cancer, followed by heart disease.
This latest admission from the CDC means that only a fraction of the claimed number of American lives are being lost directly to the virus each week.
According to the CDC’s own data, 99 percent of “Covid deaths” have been faked.
The primary or underlying cause of death is the disease, situation, or event that initiated the chain of events directly resulting in death, as earth.com notes.
Complications arising from the primary cause are usually considered secondary causes when doctors register a death certificate.
For instance, Covid could be listed as a secondary cause of death when the virus puts too much stress on a person with a pre-existing heart condition.
In this case, the primary cause of death would be heart disease, with Covid listed as a contributing cause.
Therefore, the number of healthy people who died from Covid alone is incredibly small as almost all of the recorded deaths were people with underlying conditions.
This news comes as the corporate media continues to hype a recent rise in Covid cases across the country.
Recently detected variants EG.5, or Eris, and BA.8.26, or Pirola, have been found in several countries and the U.S.
The media has been warning that these variants, highly mutated, are thought to be better at avoiding vaccines and natural immunity, causing more infections.
Infections have reportedly doubled across the U.S. amid the emergence of these variants, and hospital admissions among people with the virus have risen for the fifth week in a row.
However, the fearmonging reports often fail to mention that “Covid deaths” are not rising.
Nevertheless, the uptick in cases is leading to calls for the return of mask mandates and other Covid restrictions.
Hollywood movie studio Lionsgate reinforced mask mandates at its Santa Monica, California offices last week.
However, just several days later following a backlash, the studio lifted the mandate and claimed it had got the situation “under control.”
Similarly, Rutgers University in New Jersey and Morris Brown College in Georgia announced that face masks would be required for staff and students.
Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Santa Rosa, California, and Upstate Community Hospital in Syracuse, New York, also reinstated mask mandates for doctors, nurses, patients, and visitors.
In Kentucky, the Lee County School District canceled classes less than two weeks after opening because nearly one-fifth of its students were out sick with a “tripledemic” illness, including Covid, strep throat, and the flu."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_593951,"United States Navy SEALs on Thursday found 15 missing Maui children imprisoned in padlocked cages lined with piddle pads at a warehouse near Pier 51 in Honolulu Harbor, but repatriating them with their families has proven problematic, a source in General Eric M. Smith’s office told Real Raw News.

Since mid-August, the White Hat coalition has skirmished with regime forces while searching for 1,500 children whose parents had not re-enrolled them for school in 2023, even though many attended schools that survived the fires or were distant enough to avoid damage. Our sources believe that FEMA and the regime’s unlawful Joint Task Force 5-0, commanded by Gen. Charles Flynn, murdered many of the missing, evidenced by bodies found in mass graves, but do not believe that Biden’s forces gunned down or took flamethrowers to all 1,500.

The federal government and its media allies have refuted claims that children in Maui went missing, saying they either left Hawaii or registered for distance learning due to an emerging strain of Covid.

Our source said that is an implausible excuse, for U.S. Marines in Lahaina had interviewed credible residents who witnessed federal agents stuffing kids into busses and driving them to destinations unknown.

“Our people get intel from locals, the ‘Lahaina Underground,’ residents that didn’t flee and want Governor Green and the cabal ejected from the island. Our purpose is threefold: expel or destroy Biden’s occupying forces, aid relief efforts, find the children,” our source said.

He added that Marine reconnaissance platoons in and around Lahaina heard rumors suggesting the feds had ferried or flown kidnapped kids from Maui to Oahu, ostensibly to sell to child slavers or adrenochrome harvesters. The stories were too numerous and craven to dismiss as hearsay, so Marines forwarded the villagers’ detailed accounts up the chain of command to General Smith’s office at Camp Pendleton.

General Smith was particularly interested in a story that surfaced the previous day, originating from a Lahaina woman claiming to have overheard a conversation in which federal goons and JTF 5-0 personnel discussed a nefarious plan to sneak a dozen children they had hidden in Maui to a safehouse at the Honolulu docks on Oahu. She listened to only a fragment of the conversation before fleeing for fear of being captured or killed.

Our source said that Gen. Smith contacted his U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command allies, who activated a SEAL team to investigate the terrifying tale. The team’s leader said the frogmen would leave at once for Hawaii but expressed concern that the children might be gone by the time they had eyes on Honolulu Harbor, as the intel would be over a day old. NSWC ordered the SEALs to check piers 39-51, where container ships routinely berthed, and nearby buildings for signs of missing children. An OV-22 Osprey on alert at Marine Corps Base Hawaii would await a request for extraction.

The team arrived in Honolulu Thursday night and scoured several shipless piers and structures before abruptly stopping outside a storage building that smelled like ammonia; it held only fish packed in ice. Undeterred, the SEALs continued their rudderless search, finding at 3:00 a.m. a warehouse guarded by three men clad in tactical gear and toting automatic rifles. Cloaked in shadow, the SEALs deployed parabolic microphones and infrared scanners while aiming silenced rifles at their quarry downrange; the guards mumbled amongst one another about their frustration at being paid a pittance to work the graveyard shift, and the infrared guns revealed multiple heat blooms inside the warehouse.

“They couldn’t tell the number of warm bodies in there, just clusters of temperature gradients. The probability of employees working in a dark warehouse at three in the morning was about zero,” our source said.

A few SEALs separated into a sniper team and scaled an access ladder to the rooftop of a nearby maintenance building. They set up overwatch while the oblivious sentries ambled about, their faces lit by floodlamps illuminating the façade. The SEAL commander said he wanted one alive, if possible.

The sniper made a silenced shot, and a sentry’s head exploded like a tomato, the deep red of his brainy blood spattering everywhere and his head disappearing.

“F*** this, let’s get inside,” a different sentry reportedly shouted, but his comrade had bolted across the platform, his boots thudding like hooves, and had run directly into the SEAL commander, who had maneuvered in the darkness as if guided by some inner sonar, sending the location of his prey.

The SEAL commander subdued the sentry with a single punch to the kidney.

The third guard was struggling to open the warehouse doors when a SEAL’s bullet struck his neck, killing him.

Once inside the warehouse, the SEALs saw the unimaginable: sedated children, some covered in their own urine and feces, locked inside cages barely large enough to fit a dog. Not one child made a peep. They silently stared through wire mesh as if in a hypnotic trance. In all, the warehouse held 15 young children imprisoned in filth.

The lead SEAL keyed his microphone. “We need extraction ASAP. It could get hot. Two enemy KIAs, one alive. Fifteen, I repeat 15, kids. All need medical.”

“Airborne in two minutes,” came the reply.

The VTOL Osprey soon hovered at the edge of Pier 51B and lowered its ramp. The SEALs carried the children’s limp bodies and an unconscious prisoner aboard the plane, then instructed the pilots to leave immediately.

At Marine Corps Base Hawaii, staff treated the eight boys and seven girls for acute propofol, a potent sedative, intoxication. Bloodwork also showed traces of haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia.

The prisoner, identified as Ira Shockey, an employee of Academi, the private security firm formerly known as Blackwater, told interrogators he was hired to guard the exterior and had no idea who or what was inside. He has otherwise refused to answer questions, our source said.

“What kind of people do this? The Deep State is an incubator of evil. It taints what it touches. Now we must find out if these kids’ parents are out there somewhere, or if they’re among the missing, or bodies we’ve unearthed. Macroscopically this seems insignificant—I mean, 15 kids out of 1,500 unaccounted for. We won’t stop until they’re all found or accounted for,” our source said."
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_931177,"The World Economic Forum (WEF) has urged governments to build COVID concentration camps worldwide to jail citizens who refuse to go along with the official narrative.

As The People’s Voice reported last week, a new CDC study has revealed that men are at an increased risk of dying with each shot they receive. The data shows that each year, every ‘vaccinated‘ person becomes more likely to die at a rate of seven percent, per dose, per year. As we noted in the story, “this means that the mRNA vaccines and booster shots are a ‘slow-acting genetic poison’.

Allnewspipline.com reports: As Rochester First reported this past Wednesday, oral arguments were held Wednesday morning in an appeal case over quarantine regulations relative to COVID by the NY Department of Health over a regulation that would allow the Commissioner of Health to issue isolation or quarantine orders to control the spread of a communicable disease.

With the state of New York seeking the power to quite literally FORCE New York residents to be quarantined or thrown into ‘quarantine camps,‘ as this story over at Dr. Joseph Sansone’s Substack reports, these are nothing less than concentration camps they seek to throw people into over the possibility that they’ve been exposed to what we all know now is a bioweapon THEY created!

New York State psychopathic authoritarians, Governor Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James, have formally filed an appeal this past Wednesday in an attempt to overrule the Cattaraugus County Supreme Court ruling striking down proposed concentration camps.

The state of New York is pursuing the authority to force quarantine human beings against their will and the ability to locate them in quarantine camps AKA concentration camps. The five judge court of appeals may take a couple months to render a verdict. 

This is a similar tactic that was used in NAZI Germany during World War II when Jews and Gypsies and other undesirables were said to carry diseases and were forced into concentration camps. Apparently, those that refuse to inject C19 biological weapons injections will be targeted.

And that mad rush towards tyranny happening now in New York is joined by what we’re witnessing in New Mexico, where the governor there attempted to single-handedly overthrow the United States Constitution based on her declaring an ‘emergency,’ something tyrants all across the country would love to do.

With power-drunk Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham claiming she’ll welcome a fight as outrage intensifies over her attempt to do away with the 2nd Amendment, a direct attack upon the US Constitution the tyrannical globalists absolutely need to complete if they have any intention of full scale tyranny, does Grisham not understand that the very purpose of the 2nd Amendment as written into the US Constitution is to PREVENT TYRANNY, and any ‘fight‘ that Grisham faces in a long term scenario could end up being a ‘gun fight‘ if worse comes to worse?!

And with that in mind, it shouldn’t be seen as any kind of surprise that the people of Albuquerque have responded the way people should always respond against tyranny, with gun sales there going through the roof. And while we pray that a ‘gun fight‘ is avoided in the days, weeks and months ahead, as many  have warned as we’re herded towards full-scale tyranny, it may come down to that with the 2nd Amendment and the American people the final line in the sand between freedom and outright tyranny. 

And as we’ve long warned on ANP, ‘tyranny‘ should never have a ‘safe space’ in a ‘free country’.

Yet we’re getting just that at a time when they’re killing off America’s young, fighting age men while allowing fighting age men from China into the country over joe biden’s disastrous southern border, with illegal border crossings by Chinese military-aged men up a whopping 900% on Biden’s treason. 

And with these ‘attacks’ on American men going on for years now, and seen in the young men who protested the stolen 2020 election being thrown into the ‘DC gulags,’ something any Communist country would do, what better way for ‘enemies of America within or without’ to take out those who’d stand against them than to take out America’s ‘first line of defense‘ by killing them off with bioweapons even before any ‘world war‘ is openly declared? In fact we’ll probably  never see an ‘open declaration‘ of World War 3 with it clearly going on already for years now seen in the fact they’ve been letting young, fighting age men from China into the country at the same time as they’re killing off Americans. 

So the globalists right now setting up the next ‘scamdemic,‘ full of lockdowns and mandatory jabs, while attempting to disarm American citizens in one state and attempting to establish ‘concentration camps‘ in another state, are loud and clear warnings that can only be ignored at our own peril. The following email recently came to us from an ANP reader whose son works for a police department. 

My son works for the …..PD and on 9/11 all of the local mayors got calls from the Feds telling them that this next Plandemic is coming fast, going to be much worse than last time, and they need their support in masks, locking down all of their businesses and schools, and pushing the new “vaccine”.

Then the mayor called in all of the employees and cops and discussed social media do’s and don’ts as a public employee. In other words, don’t badmouth the city for their upcoming planned tyranny.

And while we’ve been hearing all of this about mainly young, fighting age American men, the story over at the Daily Mail this past Sunday angered Susan Duclos and I to no end and showed us the ‘big picture‘ in heartbreaking fashion. Telling us the story of 5-year-old ‘Cathy‘ of New South Wales whose family had taken her to the hospital after she fell ill, the hospital simply released her, telling her family to keep doing what they were doing to treat her for ‘a cold,’ only for the family to bring ‘Cathy‘ back to the hospital days later after her breathing was suffering.

With the hospital this time deciding to do tests on ‘Cathy‘ for COVID-19 and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), as the Daily Mail story reports, when both of those tests came back negative, the five-year-old was once again sent home. But this time, only days later, little Cathy collapsed in her mothers arms and when emergency crews arrived at their home and tried to resuscitate her and were unable to, she was flown back to the hospital, only to be pronounced dead just hours later.

With little Cathy later found by the coroner to be suffering from the common bacterial disease Strep A, a diagnosis which is made by a simple throat swab, Strep A could have easily been treated with antibiotics if it had been diagnosed correctly on her 1st hospital visit, but the medical system of 2023 somehow missed it, although the treatment for Strep A has been used since all the way back in the 1930’s. 

Just another sign of the total collapse of our medical system, a collapse seen in ANP readers being told they’re often unable to get medical appointments for months for things they used to be able to get appointments for in a week, even the doctor for both Susan and I is now a patient herself, suffering from the same kinds of ‘service,’ and she recently told Susan SHE HERSELF has to wait months and months to get appointments to see HER own Doctor; America’s medical system ripped to pieces.

With the story of 5-year-old Cathy a perfect example of our healthcare system failing us, with Cathy dying from something that would have most likely been easily caught ‘before COVID,‘ but them missing the proper diagnosis because they were too focused on ‘COVID,’ we’d warned on ANP all the way back on February 10th of 2020 after we interviewed bioweapons expert Dr. Francis Boyle that ‘COVID‘ could collapse America’s healthcare system. And Dr. Boyle also told us way back then that COVID was most likely ‘created in a lab,’ a claim called crazy by the MSM for the years following. "

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_517968,"Two years ago Klaus Schwab openly declared that by they year 2030 the World Economic Forum would have full control over humanity.

Of course, Schwab tried to frame this as a positive development for the people of the world. In his psychopathic mind, we the people need to be ruled by the globalist elite for our own good, and he’s got a plan for us that involves murdering the vast majority of the world population, and for those who survive the mass extinction event, a grim future of eating bugs and crickets, banning meat and dairy, banning private cars, and 15 minute cities that could be more accurately described as open-air prisons.

Unfortunately for Schwab, the plan to lock up humanity by the year 2030 is not going to plan. The people of the world are slowly but surely waking up to the truth about his evil agenda and Schwab is becoming increasingly terrified of being held to account.

The global elite are now acting like cornered rats and it’s our job to make sure they do not escape.
Before we dive in, subscribe to the channel if you haven’t already, and join the People’s Voice Locals Community for uncensored and exclusive news and views.
The World Economic Forum’s Agenda 2030 is at risk of failing, according to Klaus Schwab who has warned his fellow elites that their globalization and depopulation agendas have been exposed and must now be ramped up if they have any hope of succeeding.
When historians look back on this era it will be remembered as the time the globalist elite revealed their hand and began to lose their grip on power.
According to Klaus Schwab’s right hand man Yuval Noah Harari, the liberal rules-based order that the globalist elite have been working on for decades is suddenly in danger of being dismantled by the people of the world.
And what is the greatest achievement of liberal US foreign policy, according to Harari? Here’s a hint. It sounds a lot like the brand of liberal authoritarian fascism pushed by Klaus Schwab from his hideout in the mountains of Switzerland.

Those five words should be enough to send a chill down the spine of any self-respecting citizen of the free world.
The globalist elite are now more dangerous than ever. They are cornered rats, willing to do anything because they can see defeat on the horizon. And all of those who called for a New World Order are now running scared.

Klaus Schwab isn’t the only globalist who is terrified the New World Order is failing.
United Nations elites descended on New York City this week to attend the 2023 Sustainable Development Goals Summit and devise an “urgent plan” to save Agenda 2030 because, according to UN Secretary-General António Guterres, the deeply unpopular globalist plot is “in peril.”
In an address delivered before the attendees, including Joe Biden, Guterres said, “Today, only 15% of the targets are on track, with many going into reverse,” before issuing a call for a “global rescue plan” to pull Agenda 2030 back from the jaws of defeat.
This is what desperation looks like.
Of course, they won’t admit that the people of the world have woken up to their agenda. They will double down and continue with their plan because as Proverbs 4:16 says, wicked doesn’t sleep.
Just this week, Klaus Schwab went on record thanking European bureaucrats for passing a new chip law. According to Schwab, this is an important step to create a physical brain for digitization.

There is simply no room for humanity in the WEF’s dystopian vision of the future.
Free thinkers and truth-tellers like Russell Brand are already being de-platformed and canceled by the globalist elite, with their attack dogs in the mainstream media acting as their propaganda department.
First they came for Brett Kavanaugh with a carefully crafted defamation campaign. Then they came for Russell Brand, who was smeared by the UK’s far-left Channel 4 and a team of anonymous women. It appears he was getting too close to the truth on his popular YouTube channel.
And now they are targeting Tim Ballard, the real-life hero of the Sound of Freedom movie, who was warned by the globalist elite that they would end his career in retribution for daring to expose the global child trafficking industry to the masses.
These are desperate ploys by the elite who know the people are waking up to their evil plans. But they simply won’t work. The people have woken up and the revolution against the elites has begun.
In WEF-infiltrated Canada the media is hard at work pushing Klaus Schwab’s insect eating agenda, but there is just one problem. Even the TV show hosts are struggling to pretend they are enjoying the WEF’s plans for humanity.
2023 is the year the elite became desperate and revealed their hand. While the battle will continue to rage for some time, do not lose hope. We are defeating the New World Order. Now their plans are out in the open, it is time that we as humans come together and shape the future that we want. The future is not written in stone and does not belong to them.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_554898,"Bill Gates’ latest venture to mass vaccinate billions of people around the globe with his mRNA ‘air vaccine’ has been given the green-light by multiple governments.

The air vaccine will “indiscriminately” force jab the entire planet with mRNA, delivering the toxic chemicals straight into a person’s lungs.

A team from Yale University developed the method for delivering the dangerous chemicals into people’s lungs. The method has also been used to vaccinate mice intranasally, “opening the door for human testing in the near future.”

Activistpost.com reports: While scientists may celebrate this invention as a convenient method to vaccinate large populations, skeptics have started to raise obvious concerns about the potential misuse of an airborne vaccine, including the possibility of covert bioenhancements a concept that has previously been suggested in academic literature.

Roman Balmakov of Facts Matter discusses the study in the video below:

In the research, the scientists used polymer nanoparticles to encapsulate mRNA, transforming it into an inhalable form for delivery to the lungs. Courtney Malo, who serves as an editor at Science Translational Medicine, the publication that featured the study, explained,

By creating an airborne vaccine, the ruling class doesn’t have to convince people to spend their time getting injected individually. This can take time and be arduous, especially if people continue to reject “vaccines.” It’s much easier to get the mRNA technology into the bodies of humans if the rulers can just release it in the air. But if they can do this with vaccines, what’s stopping them from creating a bioweapon that everyone inhales?

An airborne vaccine, much like a bioweapon, can be released into the air without consent or even the public’s knowledge.

COVID-19 has always been about the “vaccine” and getting it into as many human beings as possible.  That’s still part of the endgame. The rulers need to get as many people as possible exposed to mRNA technology with the least amount of cost and effort. The airborne vaccine is a solution to the “problem” the ruling class has with “vaccine hesitancy.”"
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_62732,"World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab is a “globalist terrorist” who is “holding humanity to ransom”, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin who warned the elite that their New World Order has failed and their “days are numbered.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a speech on October 5 at the plenary session of the 20th meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club in Sochi and emphasized the tectonic and irreversible shifts taking place in the global order.

According to Putin, globalists including Schwab and his close advisors are “legitimate military targets” because they have been actively attempting to seize power illegally via a globalist coup d’etat.

Sixteen years ago, at the 2007 Munich Security Conference, Putin told Western leaders that the natural type of international system is multipolarity, clearly showing that Russia would oppose the creation of a New World Order based on the international liberal rules-based-order aggressively pushed by the globalist elite and their liberal politicians in Western democracies.

The moment of truth has come, according to Putin, and the global elite’s plans for a New World Order are receding in front of our eyes while a new multipolar world, in which traditional cultures retain their heritage within their own borders, is rising like a phoenix.

Putin Outlines Six Civilizational Principles For the Post-NWO World
During his Valdai speech, Putin outlined six principles Russia wants to adhere to and offers other nations to join it. Via Sputnik:
“First, we want to live in an open, interconnected world, in which no one will ever try to erect artificial barriers to people’s communication, their creative realization, and prosperity. There must be a barrier-free environment,” Putin said.
The second principle is the diversity of the world, which should not only be preserved, but should also be the foundation of universal development.
The third principle, according to the Russian head of state, is maximum representativeness: “No one has the right or can rule the world for others or on behalf of others. The world of the future is a world of collective decisions,” the president emphasized.
Fourth is universal security and lasting peace that takes into account the interests of great states and small countries equally. To achieve this, it is important to free international relations from the bloc mentality and the dark legacy of the colonial era and Cold War, according to Putin.
The fifth principle is justice for all: “The era of exploitation of anyone – I have already said this twice – is a thing of the past. Countries and peoples are clearly aware of their interests and capabilities and are ready to rely on themselves, and this multiplies their strength. Everyone must be provided with access to the benefits of modern development,” Putin emphasized.
The sixth principle is equality: no one should be forced to obey those who are richer or more powerful at the cost of their own development and national interests, according to the Russian president.

“The ‘civilizational model’ referred to in Putin’s speech seems anchored on ‘principles’ – such as non-colonial relations; non-patronizing attitudes; respectful of diversity rooted in the diverse traditions – that will require a huge work to generate new shared international norms,” according to Paolo Raffone, a strategic analyst and director of the CIPI Foundation in Brussels.

“The Western ‘rules-based liberal international order’ is unilateral, and it could be imposed in a specific time in history leveraging on the power and prominence of a small group of colonial powers that after the liberal model crisis and civil war (1914-1945) has been inherited by a distant but super-powerful country (US).

“In a nutshell, I can say that the ‘civilizational model’ approach probably aims at structuring a shared world ‘software,’ while the ‘liberal rules-based order’ has been aiming at building an imposed ‘hardware’ defended by ‘rules’ serving the financial and military hegemony.”"

“So much of the work that happened in that [Trump] administration turns out to have been right. And that’s what is so frustrating for me. The work on the border wall? We didn’t like the messenger, so we killed the message. Turned out it was right. Issuing long-term debt to refinance when rates were at zero? We didn’t like the messenger, so we killed the message. A structural peace in the Middle East? We didn’t like the messenger, so we killed the message.”

“When are we gonna stop shooting ourselves in the foot? And when are we going to actually see and take the time to look past who is saying things and actually listen to them word for word?”

“If it’s clear that the last two weeks have been a wake-up call, the next question is: Why?”

“Part of the answer is the sheer depravity of Hamas’s terrorism. That depravity has made the justification and celebration of their acts by those who police pronouns that much starker. The contradictions and moral bankruptcy of a worldview that spends years worrying about microaggressions and tone policing, but can’t decide what side it is on after the beheading of babies, aren’t exactly difficult to spot.”

“To put it another way: when Black Lives Matter organizations are lionizing Islamist terrorists by posting a paraglider logo, you’d be a fool not to reassess things.”

“The events of the last week have shattered the illusion that wokeness is about protecting victims and standing up for persecuted minorities. This ideology is and has always been about the one thing many of us have told you it is about for years: power.

Claims of beheaded babies have been debunked by the investigation, and no such horrifying incidents have been confirmed.

6. Treatment of Bodies

The investigation raises concerns about the treatment of the deceased. Allegations of defiling Hamas fighters’ bodies have emerged, while Israeli soldiers were reportedly handled with respect and taken to morgues according to standard protocols.

7. Limited Incidents of Hamas Shooting

The number of people Hamas is reported to have shot is significantly lower than previously indicated, with less than 100 individuals affected. Most of those shot were reportedly settlers who were armed at the time.

8. Crossfire Incidents Involving Foreign Workers

In a tragic turn of events, many Filipino and Thai workers were caught in crossfire situations due to exchanges of gunfire between the IDF and Hamas. According to sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all bullets found in the bodies of Thai workers were removed before their remains were released to the Thai authorities.

Haaretz’s investigation has brought to the forefront a stark contrast between the official narrative and the ground realities of the events of October 7th. These revelations underscore the importance of transparent and accurate reporting, as well as the need for a thorough and impartial examination of the circumstances surrounding this tragic day. The full extent of the consequences is still unfolding, and further investigations may be needed to shed more light on the situation."

The CDC got exactly what it wanted for Christmas: nationwide data showing sky-high levels of the latest COVID strain in the water supply.

The most recent control tactic.

All winter, the CDC and FDA have been using the new contagious JN.1 variant to push their WEF-endorsed policies. Whether we’re supposed to be eating outdoors for the holidays or getting a combined flu + COVID shot, the actual truth is far more troubling.

What they’re not telling you.

Unsurprisingly, the biggest COVID-related story was completely buried by the mainstream media. Despite vaccine status, repeat infections of COVID may actually compound negative effects:

The most important thing you can do is be prepared ahead of time. That’s where The Wellness Company’s Medical Emergency Kits come in.

Declare independence from Joe Biden’s healthcare system.

The Wellness Company and its great doctors – like Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Drew, Dr. Harvey Risch, and Dr. Jim Thorp – are regularly in the media fighting against the broken medical establishment.

Dr. Thorp, one of the nation’s leading critics of corrupt Big Pharma, believes that now – more than ever – people should be prepared for the next crisis:

We can’t rely on our crumbling healthcare system to have our backs in an emergency. I’ve strongly recommended “stockpiling” critical medications for years – like the meds found in our Medical Emergency Kits. Early intervention is KEY at the first sign of symptoms. Taking an active approach by being prepared for the next illness has helped my family tremendously.

The Wellness Company and its doctors are medical professionals that you can trust and their new Medical Emergency Kits are the gold standard when it comes to keeping you safe and healthy.

The ultimate safeguard for your health.

Be ready for the next crisis. This medical emergency kit contains an assortment of life-saving medications – including Ivermectin, Amoxicillin, and Z-Pak. The Medical Emergency Kit includes a guidebook to aid in the safe use of these life-saving medications.

This kit is prescription-only – you can’t find it in any store or pharmacy. Order your kit at The Wellness Company. Simply fill out a short questionnaire after purchase, and a trusted Wellness Company doctor will confirm your suitability and issue your prescription Medical Emergency Kit.

Excellent Kit! This medical emergency kit is great. Having it “just in case” gives me peace of mind. Highly recommend. Thank you! – Melinda C.

Great medical emergency kit. Kit came as advertised! Neat and orderly. The guide is great. Only plan on using it in an emergency during a difficult time. Confident it is what I was counting on. – Fred D.

Politifact_FALSE_Press release_814222,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) recently introduced the Safe and Open Streets Act, legislation that would make it a federal crime to purposely obstruct, delay, or affect commerce by blocking a public road or highway. 

The Safe and Open Streets Act is in direct response to radical tactics of pro-Palestine protestors who have intentionally blocked roads and highways across the country. In November, protestors completely blocked the Durham Freeway in Durham, North Carolina during rush hour, stranding drivers and compromising the free flow of commerce. No arrests were made. Late last month, during one of the busiest travel days of the year, protestors blocked airport access roads in New York City and Los Angeles. 

The Safe and Open Streets Act would penalize lawbreakers through fines or up to five years of imprisonment.

“The emerging tactic of radical protestors blocking roads and stopping commerce is not only obnoxious to innocent commuters, but it’s also dangerous and will eventually get people killed. It needs to be a crime throughout the country,” said Senator Tillis. “I’m proud to introduce the Safe and Open Streets Act so radical activists who resort to these reckless and dangerous tactics are held accountable under the full weight of the law for endangering public safety.” 

“Blocking major roads to stop traffic flows is nothing short of lawlessness that should not be tolerated,” said Senator Blackburn. “These activists are not only intentionally creating a dangerous situation for themselves, but perhaps for a citizen who is awaiting an ambulance or a hard worker who will lose their job for being late. The Safe and Open Streets Act is critical to stopping this reckless behavior, particularly by Hamas sympathizers, in our U.S. cities.”

First we need to understand men & women were designed to carry OPPOSITE roles in nature. Women of the present day, were biologically designed to carry one man’s sperm cells every 7 years. Today they’re carrying 3-5+

A man’s body is designed to GIVE off DNA, & she is designed to RECEIVE DNA—to birth LIFE—he is the electric provider, he is the magnetic receiver

If you think that’s ‘bullshit’ look into the scientific term known as “Telegony” which occurs when a woman sleeps with more than one man in a few years time. This is the occurrence of heredity traits getting past on to child from previous partner(s) of the mother. So if a man sleeps with a woman who’s had relations with another man that previous year, the 1st man’s “sperm” (DNA) can possibly ‘override’ the new mans sperm & FUSE with the new mans sperm, impregnating the woman. This is the METAPHYISCAL science of telegony, & this is why so many men are claiming their children don’t look like them

Men’s astral fluid is like a personal code & women’s bodies are the divine computer for that code to be placed in for bringing life. Essentially women are designed to be sponges for genetic material from their partners. Pregnancy with a male child is the most popularly talked about way that explains why a women has foreign male DNA in her body but that’s only the surface: the more promiscuous women become they more they get ‘high‘ off a man’s DNA—That imprint can often create illusion of a sexual addiction

Not only does society suppress scientific research of Telegony , but it’s clearly & explicitly written in almost every ancient religious text—this isn’t about religion but human testaments to experiences—guides, so to speak—literal & are binded to the real-life metaphors contained within, they’ve succeeded into programming us to think that sexual immorality & degeneracy is just everyday—ordinary & completely normal

Innerstand both genders should be careful who they share their temple with—Sex is the foundation of creation, a way to connect with the divine—without it nothing exists, it should respected as such"

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_465912,"A Quebec man has admitted to setting a series of forest fires that ravaged the province and forced hundreds of people to flee their homes last year.

Brian Paré, 38, had posted numerous conspiracy theories online suggesting the government had deliberately ignited the blazes. At the same time, the Trudeau Liberals blamed climate change.

According to CTV News, Paré pleaded guilty to 13 counts of arson and one count of arson with disregard for human life at a courthouse in Chibougamau, Quebec on Monday. Two further charges of breaking and entering, and causing a public nuisance have been conditionally suspended.

The court has ordered a pre-trial sentencing report that will take Paré's mental state and risk to public safety into consideration. It is scheduled to be completed by April 22.

Prosecutor Marie-Phillippe Charron explained in court that two of the 14 fires now known to have been set by Paré resulted in the multi-day evacuation of nearly 500 homes in the small community of Chapais, around 260 miles northwest of the provincial capital.

""On May 31 at 8:30 pm, the town of Chapais issued a mandatory evacuation order due to the raging fires, in particular the fire at Lake Cavan as well as the airport fire, two fires that are included in the charges and were cause by the accused,"" Charron stated.

Many of the fires Paré set were found to have ""no possible natural cause.""

The now-self-admitted arsonist has been held in custody since his arrest on September 7. He was detained following an investigation that began in June after investigators believed he was at the scene of one of the fires. While he was originally tracked down as a witness, Paré's online activity matched that provided in a description by police.

He repeatedly posted conspiracy theories suggesting the fires had been set by the government in an attempt to coerce the public into believing in climate change.



Around the same time, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau claimed that forest fires were becoming more common ""because of climate change."""

""Survivor"" winner and Kentucky Republican lawmaker Nick Wilson wants to legalize sexual relations with first cousins as one of his flagship legislative issues in the 2024 session, Newsweek reported.

Wilson was elected for his first full term in 2023, having previously taken a seat after another Republican retired in 2022. He ran unopposed.

The Kentucky General Assembly introduced the bill on Tuesday. He said that the law would strike ""first cousin from the list of familial relationships"" defined as unlawful incest in Kentucky. It would also remove incest as a class D felony for some cases ""unless it is committed with a person who is less than twelve years of age,"" in which case it is Class C. The age of consent in the state is 16.

According to the current state law, a person is guilty if they have sexual relations with a person they are knowingly aware is a ""parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, great-grandparent, great-grandchild, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, brother, sister, first cousin, ancestor, or descendant.""

Wilson won the 37th season of CBS show Survivor in 2018.

Newsweek shared a TikTok video from a fellow ""Survivor"" contestant and New York public defender Eliza Orlins reacting to the bill.

""Oh, my, God, I've got some wild news,"" she told fans. ""This news relates to David vs. Goliath winner of Survivor Nick Wilson, who then leveraged the fame he obtained from winning Survivor to run for Kentucky state legislator and got elected.

""Nick Wilson is not only supporting but has introduced a bill that would reclassify incest in the state of Kentucky to not include your own first cousin. Kentucky, like so many other places, is facing a lot of issues, and this is Nick's top legislative priority."""
Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_351885,"World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab has admitted the people of the world have rejected his “Great Reset” plan for humanity and have risen up against the establishment.

However, rather than admit that his anti-human agenda, which is based on outdated Marxist principles, is a failure, Schwab is doubling down, and threatening to impose his agenda by force.

According to Schwab, the future of elections must involve decision-making AI because the people have proven themselves unworthy to be trusted to make choices for themselves.

Professor Schwab’s new rhetoric against the right of people to choose their own leaders and politics should come as no surprise.
Bill Gates is planning to use AI to interfere in elections and place World Economic Forum Young Global Leaders in positions of power around the world in 2024 in a desperate attempt at implementing his globalist vision and evading justice for his crimes against humanity.
How do we know what Gates is planning? Because, as usual, he has told us all about his plans in advance. Gates has an uncanny track record of predicting future black swan events, and coincidentally being perfectly placed to profit from them when they happen.
As Robert F. Kennedy Jr says, Gates enjoys nothing more than playing God with the lives of people he considers “lesser humans” and it’s high time we catch him in the act and ensure he faces justice for his slew of crimes. Watch:"

Movsum Samadov is a recently released terrorist and illegal migrant that came through our southern border and into Arizona.

Folks, a wide open border is a major threat to each and every American.

More on Movsum Samadov that will make your blood boil.

Movsum Samadov, the head of the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan, faced imprisonment following his criticism of the country's religious freedom conditions and his political activities. On January 7, 2011, he was arrested by authorities during a traffic stop, initially charged with failing to comply with a lawful police order. This arrest occurred shortly after a January 2 speech where Samadov openly criticized President Ilham Aliyev, particularly over the ban on wearing religious headscarves in schools, among other national issues. The same day as his arrest, he was sentenced to 13 days in administrative detention by the Narimanov District Court, during which he reportedly was denied the right to choose his own lawyer.

On the last day of his administrative detention, January 20, 2011, Samadov faced more severe charges, including ""preparing a crime,"" ""preparing terrorism,"" ""illegally dealing with firearms and explosives,"" and ""actions aimed at violently seizing or maintaining power."" Consequently, the Baku Grave Crimes Court sentenced him to 12 years in prison on October 7, 2011.

While in prison, in March 2017, Samadov reportedly spent five days in a punishment cell for praying, highlighting ongoing religious freedom issues in Azerbaijan. After serving his full sentence, Samadov was released on January 19, 2023.

Samadov's case has been covered by various sources, including Voice of America, the Institute for Peace and Democracy, Forum 18, the European Court of Human Rights, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, all documenting the challenges and human rights issues he faced during his imprisonment. His situation underscores the complex intersection of politics, religion, and human rights in Azerbaijan.

He undid all of the policies that former President Donald J. Trump put in place. As a result, over 10 million people have come across the border with no vetting, no plan, and no path. That’s more than the population of 40 of our states—and that’s not good for anyone. It has overwhelmed the communities along the border and the big cities that are receiving these people. I don’t blame people for wanting to come to this country, and it’s not their fault that they were led to come. We need to show compassion to every person, but we have to secure our borders.

One scarcely knows where to begin in documenting the errors, scandals, and misadventures of Justin Trudeau’s Liberal regime. The problem is, one scarcely knows where to end. The outrages just keep on coming.

Trudeau has come in for much caustic criticism of late, as a growing number of ordinary citizens and the independent media have expressed their justified suspicion and resentment of an overbearing and increasingly despotic administration. The issues at stake are features, not bugs. The list of noxious measures, lapses, and deeds that tarnish Trudeau’s record include:

the selling-out of Canada’s national identity
the daunting number of scandals and ethics violations
the many vacations on the public dime
the admiration for the “basic dictatorship” of Communist China
the cozying up to Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum
“the log-roll on behalf of shared interests, family businesses and powerful lobby groups” (in Alexander Brown’s pithy phrase)
the indiscriminate welcoming of migrants into the country
awarding a $10.5 million reparation payment to al-Qaeda terrorist Omar Khadr
the imposition of a carbon tax that cripples the agricultural sector and impoverishes households across the country
the invocation of the Emergencies Act (in effect, the War Measures Act), which included freezing bank accounts and taking political prisoners, to crush the Winter 2022 Trucker Freedom Convoy’s legitimate protest against the mandated Covid vaccines
and the blizzard of Internet censorship bills, such as Bill C-11, Bill C-18 (also known as the Online Streaming Act), Bill C-27 (Digital Charter Implementation Act) and S-210 (Age Verification and court-ordered website blocking)

Deserving separate mention for the magnitude of their effect are Trudeau’s two most recent legislative atrocities.

Bill C-367 proposes to arrest Christians for quoting portions of the Bible in public, to charge pastors with a “hate crime” when they preach against certain sins, and to close churches if government does not approve of the liturgy. This despite the fact that Canada’s motto, “a mari usque ad mare,” is cited from Psalm 72:8, which says that Christ shall have dominion “from sea to sea.” As LifeSite News reports, the Bill “will silence believers who oppose the woke ideology that is overrunning our country” and enable the ongoing persecution of Christians. It appears we are back circa 303 AD, when the emperors Diocletian, Maximian, Galerius and Constantius issued a series of edicts rescinding Christians' legal rights and demanding that they comply with the pagan rites of the Empire. Emperor Trudeau Minimus seems to be of the same mind.

Bill C-367 is followed by Bill C-63, the so-called Online Harms Act, updated from its predecessor Bill C-36 and S-210, and which is equally or perhaps even more diabolical. Ostensibly framed to protect children from online pornography, it also includes fines of up to $70,000 levied on individuals for online hate speech and between $10 million to $25 million for any offending online platform.  A new stand-alone hate offence would be added to the criminal code allowing for penalties of up to life imprisonment for hate crimes, subject to the interpretation of the Government and Canada’s Human Rights Tribunals. Such interpretation, warns University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist “is not subject to any legal or technical rules of evidence.” Rather, “balance of probabilities,” a notoriously flexible criterion of judgment, is the guiding principle.

The true focus is obviously not on preventing actual harms — this is a feel-good pretext to grease the passage of the Bill into law — but on snuffing anticipated and unformulated thought crimes and ultimately on silencing or canceling dissidents whose contestation might imperil the Liberal’s re-election prospects and the embedding of its totalitarian agenda. We note that Greenpeace activist, former Heritage Minister and currently Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Steven Guilbeault, argued that disparaging posts about government institutions should be made illegal and that user-generated content should be stringently regulated.

The Canadian Constitution Foundation points out that the Act “would limit constitutionally-protected expression in many alarming ways.” It would create a process whereby anonymous complaints alleging “hate speech” would be adjudicated, a sure-fire way of silencing a political opponent; whereby in certain cases warrantless entry would be permitted; whereby words could lead to life imprisonment, and judges could “put prior restraints on people who they believe on reasonable grounds may commit speech crimes in the future.” In the words of Justice Centre lawyer Marty Moore, “Far more draconian than being arrested for something you say, is being imprisoned for something someone else is afraid you’ll say.”

The problem, of course, is the definition of “reasonable grounds,” “speech crimes,” and “hate.” The answer is: whatever the Government and the Social Justice Commissioners say they are. According to the new “online harms” censorship legislation, “hate speech” is so vaguely and subjectively defined, so elastic a concept, it can mean anything the authorities want it to mean. And we can be sure that it will. 

As noted, Bill C-63 purportedly seeks to address and denounce hate propaganda and provide recourse to victims of “hate,” proposing amendments to the Criminal Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act. Ezra Levant at Rebel News observes, “Three new bureaucracies will be created as part of the new criminal code and new human rights code provisions, including a digital safety commission, a digital safety ombudsman and a digital safety office.” This sounds like the official litigating and policing offices that proliferated during the French Revolution. We recall that the Committee of Public Safety, which controlled the Revolutionary Tribunal, passed the Law of Suspects, according to which anyone suspected of resisting or criticizing the Revolution could be summarily arrested without proof of criminal behavior. If Trudeau has his way and such Jacobin legislation currently before the House is passed, Robespierre and Danton will be smiling in their graves.

The Canadian Justice Centre for Constitutional Rights and Freedoms puts the matter tersely and correctly: “Canadians’ online expression should not be censored unless it violates the Criminal Code [as it stands]. No Canadian should face an anonymous human rights complaint for what they have said. No Canadian should be hauled before a court or punished merely because somebody “fears” they will say something hateful. No Canadian should face life imprisonment for their expression.”

As President of the Justice Centre, John Carpay, explains, “The Online Harms Act would give the Canadian Human Rights Commission new powers to prosecute and punish offensive but non-criminal speech by Canadians if, in the subjective opinion of unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, they deem someone’s statement to be ‘hateful.’” Run afoul of the Liberal government’s chameleon definition of hate, which includes what can be interpreted as calls to genocide, and you will not get a juridical slap on the wrist or be forced to issue an apology or make fiscal amends. You may find yourself serving a life sentence.

This is the social and political travesty we are facing in our now chlorotic democracy. If Christians will find themselves back in Rome’s fourth century, ordinary citizens will find themselves back in Germany’s 1930s and 40s. A veritable tyranny is in the offing. Levant is of the same persuasion: “Canada is now the most dangerous place in the world for freedom of speech. Four bills. Falling like dominos. C-11, C-18, C-36, and the Online Harms Act. Each one building…a censorship regime whose only comparison is places like North Korea.”

Once C-367 and C-63 are yarked into law, and if the Trudeau government survives the next election, Levant’s fears will have been realized. This is no exaggeration. Canadian prosperity will become a thing of the past. Freedom of expression will have become a fossil remain. Dissent will have become a criminal offense. A passive and myopic citizenry, a parliament in name only, a corrupt and partisan judiciary, and a tyrannical Gauleiter of a national leader will have put paid to one of the most fortunate countries in the world. “That’s how the world ends,” wrote poet T.S. Eliot, “not with a bang but a whimper.” If we do not vigorously protest now, we will whimper later. We should not delude ourselves. It can happen here. Whether we know it or not, under the reign of the Canadian autocrat, we are on Hayek’s road to serfdom. "

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_423105,"Former Rep. Liz Cheney’s January 6 Committee suppressed evidence that President Donald Trump pushed for 10,000 National Guard troops to protect the nation’s capital, a previously hidden transcript obtained by The Federalist shows.

Cheney and her committee falsely claimed they had “no evidence” to support Trump officials’ claims the White House had communicated its desire for 10,000 National Guard troops. In fact, an early transcribed interview conducted by the committee included precisely that evidence from a key source. The interview, which Cheney attended and personally participated in, was suppressed from public release until now.

Deputy Chief of Staff Anthony Ornato’s first transcribed interview with the committee was conducted on January 28, 2022. In it, he told Cheney and her investigators that he overheard White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows push Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to request as many National Guard troops as she needed to protect the city.

He also testified President Trump had suggested 10,000 would be needed to keep the peace at the public rallies and protests scheduled for January 6, 2021. Ornato also described White House frustration with Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller’s slow deployment of assistance on the afternoon of January 6, 2021.

Not only did the committee not accurately characterize the interview, they suppressed the transcript from public review. On top of that, committee allies began publishing critical stories and even conspiracy theories about Ornato ahead of follow-up interviews with him. Ornato was a career Secret Service official who had been detailed to the security position in the White House.

Cheney frequently points skeptics of her investigation to the Government Publishing Office website that posted, she said, “transcripts, documents, exhibits & our meticulously sourced 800+ page final report.” That website provides “supporting documents” to the claims made by Cheney and fellow anti-Trump enthusiasts.

However, transcripts of fewer than half of the 1,000 interviews the committee claims it conducted are posted on that site. It is unclear how many of the hidden transcripts include exonerating information suppressed by the committee.

Those documents support the committee’s narrative rather than the truth of the events leading up to January 6, 2021, said Rep. Barry Loudermilk, chairman of the House Administration’s Subcommittee on Oversight.

“The former J6 Select Committee apparently withheld Mr. Ornato’s critical witness testimony from the American people because it contradicted their pre-determined narrative. Mr. Ornato’s testimony proves what Mr. Meadows has said all along: President Trump did in fact offer 10,000 National Guard troops to secure the U.S. Capitol, which was turned down,” said the Georgia Republican.

His subcommittee is reviewing the work of the January 6 committee, which has been accused of other unethical behavior at the expense of accuracy, as well as collusion with other Democrat efforts to prosecute political opponents.

“This is just one example of important information the former Select Committee hid from the public because it contradicted what they wanted the American people to believe,” Loudermilk said. “And this is exactly why my investigation is committed to uncovering all the facts, no matter the outcome.”

Early Corroboration For Contested Claim

A January 6 committee staffer asked Ornato, “When it comes to the National Guard statement about having 10,000 troops or any other number of troops, do you recall any discussion prior to the 6th about whether and how many National Guard troops to deploy on January 6th?”

Ornato surprised the committee by noting he did recall a conversation between Meadows and Bowser: “He was on the phone with her and wanted to make sure she had everything that she needed,” Ornato told investigators.

Ornato said White House concerns about January 6 were related to fears that left-wing groups would clash with Trump protesters and that no one in the White House anticipated a riot at the Capitol. Antifa and other left-wing groups were planning protests for the same day. Left-wing groups had been involved in violent assaults on Trump supporters following public protests.

Meadows “wanted to know if she need any more guardsmen,” Ornato testified. “And I remember the number 10,000 coming up of, you know, ‘The president wants to make sure that you have enough.’ You know, ‘He is willing to ask for 10,000.’ I remember that number. Now that you said it, it reminded me of it. And that she was all set. She had, I think it was like 350 or so for intersection control, and those types of things not in the law enforcement capacity at the time.”

Ornato was correct. Bowser declined the offer, asking only for a few hundred National Guard and requiring them to serve in a very limited capacity.

“No DCNG personnel shall be armed during this mission, and at no time, will DCNG personnel or assets be engaged in domestic surveillance, searches, or seizures of US persons,” Bowser wrote in her letter requesting the D.C. National Guard. Bowser had been a strenuous critic of Republican efforts to limit rioting from leftwing political activists in U.S. cities during 2020’s summer of violence.

Bowser’s decision to decline help from the White House did not end the Trump team’s efforts to secure troops ahead of the protest. When the D.C. mayor declined Trump’s offer of 10,000 troops, Ornato said the White House requested a “quick reaction force” out of the Defense Department in case it was needed.

“The only thing I remember with DOD and the National Guard was even though the mayor didn’t want any more National Guard in D.C., that a request was made to have kind of a, lack of better term, a quick reaction force out at Joint Base Andrews being that it was a military installation,” Ornato told investigators in the previously concealed interview. “I remember Chief Meadows talking to DOD about that, I believe. I remember Chief Meadows letting me know that, ‘Hey, there was going to be National Guard that’s going to be at Joint Base Andrews in case they’re going to need some more, we’re going to — the Mayor would need any, we’re going to make sure they’re out there.'”

Meadows was concerned that D.C. would be unprepared for the size of the crowd coming to protest the controversial 2020 election in which hundreds of laws and processes were changed to enable tens of millions of unsupervised mail-in ballots to flood the country. The January 6 Committee prevented an investigation into Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s preparation — or lack thereof — for Capitol security ahead of the event, so it is unclear if she was as concerned about keeping the peace as Meadows and the Trump White House were.

“And, again, the crowd sizes were, you know, the organizers were saying, you know, there may be 50,000 here. So that’s where it started, I think, to scare the chief a little bit of how many people were coming in for this event, and wanted to make sure that they would be able to bring in National Guard if needed for this size of this many people inside D.C.,” Ornato said.

Once the Capitol was breached, the Trump White House pushed for immediate help from Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller and grew frustrated at the slow deployment of that help, according to the testimony.

“So then I remember the chief saying, ‘Hey, I’m calling secretary of defense to get that [quick reaction force] in here,” Ornato said. Later he said, “And then I remember the chief telling Miller, ‘Get them in here, get them in here to secure the Capitol now.'”

Still later, he said, “[T]he constant was, you know, where is the National Guard? Why isn’t — you know, we’ve got to get control of this.” And again, “But, you know, [Meadows] understood the urgency, that’s for sure. And he kept, you know, getting Miller on the phone, wanting to know where they were, why aren’t they there yet.”

Days prior, Cheney had “secretly orchestrated” a pressure campaign to prevent the Defense Department from deploying resources on January 6, 2021. She organized an op-ed for the Washington Post from her father and other former secretaries of defense specifically to discourage Miller from taking action.

Ornato described Meadows’ strenuous efforts to quicken the Defense Department’s deployment of the National Guard: “Every time [Meadows] would ask, ‘What’s taking so long?’ It would be, like, you know, ‘This isn’t just start the car and we’re there. We have to muster them up, we have to’ — so it was constant excuses coming of — not excuses, but what they were actually doing to get them there. So, you know, ‘We only have so many here right now. They’re given an hour to get ready.’ So there’s, like, all these timelines that was being explained to the chief. And he relayed that, like, you know — he’s like, ‘I don’t care, just get them here,’ you know, and ‘Get them to the Capitol, not to the White House.'”

Cheney hid this testimony and instead asserted in her report that President Trump “never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day. Nor did he instruct any Federal law enforcement agency to assist.”

Her report noted that the secretary of defense “ultimately did deploy the Guard. Although evidence identifies a likely miscommunication between members of the civilian leadership in the Department of Defense impacting the timing of deployment, the Committee has found no evidence that the Department of Defense intentionally delayed deployment of the National Guard. The Select Committee recognizes that some at the Department had genuine concerns, counseling caution, that President Trump might give an illegal order to use the military in support of his efforts to overturn the election.”

Cheney has never addressed the effects of her secretly orchestrated campaign to prevent Miller from acting ahead of the January 6, 2021 protest. A new book confirms prior reporting that Cheney secretly conspired with District Attorney Fani Willis in Fulton County’s prosecution of Republicans and that she viewed it as a “platform for her to resuscitate her political career” and would “provide a springboard for a Cheney presidential run.”

Ornato’s description of events also matched testimony offered by Kash Patel, the former chief of staff to the acting secretary of defense, in the Colorado Supreme Court hearing about Democrat efforts to limit the ability of Americans to vote for the candidate of their choice. The Colorado court, whose efforts to remove Trump from the ballot were so extreme they were overturned this week by a unanimous Supreme Court, claimed Patel’s “testimony regarding Trump authorizing” at least 10,000 National Guardsmen was “illogical” and “completely devoid of any evidence in the record.” Because Ornato’s corroborating information had been suppressed from the public record by the January 6 committee, the Colorado Supreme Court improperly dismissed evidence.

‘I Never Heard Anything Like That’

Cheney and her committee did devote 2,000 words in their final report to an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that President Trump had physically overcome a Secret Service agent in his zeal to join protesters at the Capitol.

That story had been told by Cassidy Hutchinson, Cheney’s friend and star witness, along with other stories that eyewitnesses disputed. (Disclosure: Hutchinson falsely claimed this reporter received classified information from a Secret Service handler in a clandestine Georgetown meeting. She has thus far refused formal requests to correct her theatrical claim.) While the story of Trump overcoming a Secret Service agent would not be told for months, Ornato pre-rebutted it in his testimony.

Asked if he ever heard anything about Trump deciding to go to the Capitol that day, Ornato said he hadn’t. Ornato said Trump had driven by a previous rally, had flown over another, and that handlers had previously decided against him joining the day’s events.

“No. I did not know that. I mean, I don’t think — that couldn’t have happened. Nobody had — nobody would be prepared for that. There would be no security to do that. There would be no — I mean, that was like I said, talked about a couple of days, whenever it was prior, and it was scoffed at and moved on, and I never heard about it again,” Ornato said, adding that he never heard anything about Trump wanting to go to the Capitol that day. “Usually somebody would, you know, report it up or report over, like, ‘Hey, this is what I overheard’ or something, but I never heard anything like that.”

Later, Hutchinson would claim Ornato had been the source of her dramatic tale that Trump had commandeered the presidential vehicle and demanded to be taken to the Capitol. Other Secret Service sources also strongly repudiated the outlandish claim."

This surge in numbers results from President Joe Biden’s immediate reversal of former President Donald Trump’s highly effective immigration and border enforcement policies.

Legislators enacted a provision that prohibits using public land to accommodate undocumented migrants temporarily during their asylum application process.
“The bill, H.R. 5283, passed with a majority of Republicans in support, 224–203,” the outlet reported, adding that the bill’s fate in the upper chamber is also certain, but not in a positive way for the GOP.
“It’s dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate, where Democrats hold a slim majority, and many Democrats criticized the bill as a messaging tactic for the 2024 elections, where hard-line immigration policies are the cornerstone of the GOP platform,” the outlet reported.
House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) declared: “The mission of the National Park Service is to conserve the natural and cultural resources for the enjoyment of future generations, not bail out the failed border policies of the Biden administration.”
The outlet noted further:
The push for the bill comes after the Biden administration granted New York City officials’ request to build temporary housing and facilities for migrant families at Floyd Bennett Field in southeastern Brooklyn.

The bill prohibits this type of action on land under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, or the Forest Service.
It also revokes a 2023 lease between the National Park Service and New York City to use portions of the Gateway National Recreation Area to provide housing for migrants.
This comes as the GOP-led House voted on Wednesday to formally authorize its investigation into President Joe Biden’s potential impeachment.
By a party-line vote of 221-212, the Republican-controlled chamber approved the investigation, looking into whether Biden improperly benefited from his 53-year-old son Hunter Biden’s international business dealings. Hunter Biden had earlier declined an invitation to testify behind closed doors.
Claiming that it is politically motivated and lacking in evidence, the White House has rejected the investigation. Biden is gearing up for battle in anticipation of a potential rematch with Trump in the 2024 election.
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Johnson and House Republicans for the move.
During an interview on MSNBC with host Alex Wagner, the California Democrat claimed Johnson is trying to supply Republican legislators with “a red meat political stunt to distract constituents from their historically unproductive year” by pushing a “baseless impeachment of President Joe Biden.”
“Well, thank you. It is nice to be with you, Alex, especially at this difficult time for our country when we have so many needs that we have to meet so many challenges to democracy in Ukraine and in our own country and that the speaker is going down this path,” Pelosi began.
She added: “He says he has no choice the fact is, he has no respect for the Constitution of the
United States, no respect for his members, whom he’s asking to vote for an impeachment with no basis.”
WATCH:

After his trip to the border on Thursday, former President Donald Trump spoke to Fox News host Sean Hannity, where he declared the state of Texas to be a “war zone.”
“Thousands coming from Afghanistan. Now al Qaeda has training camps up again,” the host said.
“Then, you know, over 10,000, 12,000, 14,000 from Russia, and I read recently over 37,000 from China. Now, why would they make that long journey to our southern border? And my fear is that we are — we have in this country, because these illegals are not vetted, I fear that terror cells have set up in this country that will plot, plan, scheme the next 9/11 or worse,” Hannity continued.
“I pray to God, as I said, I’m wrong. I don’t think I’m wrong, Mr. President,” he said.

“Well, China, as of today, 29,000 young men, for the most part, in our country for the last three or four months. And there’s something going on. Look, there’s something going on,” Trump began.

The NASA project is called Atmospheric Perturbations Around the Eclipse Path, or APEP, which is the name of an Egyptian serpent deity that eats the sun and embodies chaos.

Apex is also called Apophis, which is where the word Apophenia comes from.

Ironically, Apophenia is the name given to the beginning stages of schizophrenia, where everything is perceived as synchronistic.

So is this ritual, and all its synchronicities, a ritual causing mass psychosis?

There are tons of “coincidences” surrounding this eclipse (I have three other reels recorded explaining them). The 7 cities crossed are named Salem and Ninevah, the Cicadas, Corpus Christi & the body of Christ, and the New Madrid Seismic Zone.

Sending a rocket to the moon is really just a large-scale sex magic ritual based on Osiris rising, where an obelisk brought him back to life.

A rocket is like a giant obelisk, and the moon is the female aspect. Ironically, Osiris rose from the dead with his arms crossed, like an X, and this eclipse is being called the “X” eclipse.

We do know those “in charge” need chaos to make order out of, considering their motto is “‘Ordo ab Chao, a Latin phrase that is translated to mean ‘Order from chaos’ in English.

Are events like this eclipse & its “coincidences” just the manifested chaos of the ritual?

The project, named Atmospheric Perturbations Around The Eclipse Path or APEP, is set to explore how the eclipse affects the upper atmosphere. They chose the name APEP after the ancient Egyptian serpent known for battling the sun god Ra. Makes you wonder about the dark symbolism they're leaning into.
Not only all this but CERN will be activating the large hadron collider on the same day. Oh, and don't forget the Devil Comet will also be visible as well.

So what I want to know is this...
Why is CERN being reactivated on April 8, the same day as the infamous eclipse? Supposedly, the particle collider can accelerate protons to a rate that's only 7 mph slower than the speed of light, resulting in 11,000 trips around its ring per second. After CERN started its Awake experiment in 2016, conspiracy theorists were convinced CERN was opening portals in the sky when photos taken near the facility revealed strange electromagnetic storms above it.
My gut instinct is that something really big is being planned for that day... perhaps a total takedown of both the grid and society in general worldwide...

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_467064,"Tennessee has become the first State in America to ban Bill Gates’ toxic mRNA from being pumped into the food supply.

The move comes after the billionaire eugenicist vowed to force vaccinate every human being with new mRNA vaccines by pumping chemicals into the food and water supplies.

The bill, HB1894, was discussed in the Tennessee Senate on Thursday before a vote to send it to Gov. Bill Lee’ desk.

Wsmv.com reports: “As introduced, defines food that contains a vaccine or vaccine material as a drug for purposes of the Tennessee Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,” the bill reads.

Sen. Joey Hensley, R-Hohenwald, spoke during the session about the bill, which he’s sponsoring.

“House Bill 1894 merely would require any food that contains a vaccine or vaccine material would have to be classified as a drug and labeled as such,” he said.

Questioning the bill, Sen. Heidi Campbell, D-Nashville, asked if Hensley knew of any instances where food containing vaccines was offered in Tennessee.

“So does the sponsor know of any instances of there being food offered in the state of Tennessee that contains vaccines and some kind of a retail or public forum?” Campbell asked.

“No, I do not know any specific examples. But certainly they are developing this process. And actually, Congress has actually dealt with this as well and passed an amendment that said no fund could be used for transgenic edible vaccines. This is a process that is being developed. But this bill merely would say that if that happens in the future, that food would have to be classified as a drug if it had a vaccine in it,” Hensley replied.

“So while I feel like this legislation’s basically anodyne, I mean, I guess it’s addressing something that I can’t imagine whatever exists, which is the idea that we would somehow be putting vaccines into foods that you would buy in a grocery store. I mean, I can’t think of any logical reason why anyone would ever do that. And I do know that, you know, certainly, there have been experiments with putting vaccines in vegetables for the purposes of, of studying possible transmission methods. But the idea that this would somehow correlate to some kind of a retail offering of vegetables, especially when that vegetable would cost, you know, many thousands of dollars, just seems to me, I guess, messy, to be passing legislation for that reason. So I will be voting no,” Campbell added.

To continue the discussion, Sen. Frank Niceley, R-Strawberry Plains, spoke in favor of the bill with an anecdote about lettuce.

“Actually I’ve been reading about data for a couple of years now and evidently with this new technology, they can raise this lettuce is what they’re talking about first. They can raise this stuff so cheap, and I’ve been reading about it talking about putting it in and lettuce and mass medicate everybody, like they do with fluoride in the water. I mean, who could control the dose? If you’re if you eat a lot of lettuce, you’re gonna get a lot of mRNA if you don’t eat any won’t get any. And they’re actually talking about other vegetables that they’re trying to put this in. And my question is, would this have to be sold at a drugstore? Would you still buy it in a grocery store? Why don’t we just outlaw this stuff completely? We don’t have any idea what its gonna do to our children? I mean, to us and old people anything? I mean, is this stuff locked out of a science fiction movie? I mean, it’s, it’s ridiculous. It’s changes your DNA, mRNA changes your DNA when if you have your DNA tested now, and you eat a bunch of this, lettuce take a bunch of these MRNA vaccines, and you go back and get your DNA tested again, it’s gonna be a little different. It’s not going to be the same as it was that you were born with that you got from your parents. This is dangerous stuff. We need to study it probably need to outlaw it. I mean, I can’t imagine. When I first read about this, I thought this can not be true. But you keep reading about it. And it is true,” Niceley said.

Shortly after the discussion, it was voted on and passed in the Senate."
Politifact_FALSE_Social media_157744,"Show your Democrat friend this post when they claim voter fraud doesn't occur. 
From the Federal Social Security website (link below), you can see how many people each of the 43 states are registering to vote who DO NOT HAVE IDs. The ""Total NON MATCHES"" column below show how many people in Minnesota were registered to vote, but where their data was rejected by the SSA because the social security number and birthdate provided did not match federal records - in other words: made-up data. Problem is, in Minnesota, we are the only state that allows SAME-DAY REGISTRATION WITHOUT HOLDING THE BALLOT SEPERATELY UNTIL THE VOTER'S REGISTRATION CAN BE VERIFIED (called Provisional Balloting). THIS MEANS SOMEONE CAN REGISTER TO VOTE, CAST THEIR BALLOT, IT WILL BE SCANNED, COUNTED, AND KEPT WITHOUT ANY TRACE OF PULLING THE BALLOT OUT WHEN THE REGISTRATION IS REJECTED BY THE SSA HAVA VERIFICATION SYSTEM DAYS LATER.  102,126 voter registrations have been found to be fraudulent by the SSA just in Minnesota alone. 6.5 million in Texas. This is why provisional ballots are essential to election integrity. And Minnesota Democrats have rejected them each and every time they come up for a vote in the legislature. 102,000 - Does this meet the definition of ""widespread"" when statewide elections have been lost by a few hundred votes?
The real answer to voter fraud, and what I have consistently repeated for many years is this: In Minnesota, we do not have secure elections and the laws we have are so loose and messy that it is IMPOSSIBLE to find fraud because we don't have voter ID or provisional ballots and the Secretary of State refuses to clean up our voter rolls. Even the Secretary of State testified that voter fraud exists in every election to a certain degree. We just have no way to determine how many votes are cast fraudulently until we have laws that allow us to check and filter out all the votes that are cast unlawfully. Even your Democrat friends should be able to support provisional ballots - once they understand the facts of the problem.

According to The Epoch Times, the 780,000 reports contained in the newly released data were made after the various COVID-19 vaccines were released to the public during the pandemic. People who received the vaccine reported having issues such as seizures, heart inflammation, and miscarriages after being vaccinated.

One individual reported, “Loss of consciousness and seizure immediately following injection. Went to ER by ambulance.” Another person reported that they received a Bell’s Palsy diagnosis after experiencing “left-sided facial numbness and paralysis.”

According to The Epoch Times, the vaccine injury reports were made through the V-safe text-message system designed by the CDC to monitor potential side effects caused by the COVID-19 vaccines. While the CDC previously refused to publish the V-safe reports, the Epoch Times reported that the agency was forced in a lawsuit to release other information in 2022. The information showed approximately 8% of 10 million users needed medical care after receiving the COVID-19 vaccines.

The Epoch Times reported that U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ordered the CDC in January to release free-text entries from the vaccine injury reports following a lawsuit brought by the Freedom Coalition of Doctors for Choice. The first two releases, comprised of 780,000 reports from roughly 523,000 people, document thousands of tinnitus reports, hundreds of facial paralysis reports, and dozens of heart inflammation reports.

The newly released reports show that some individuals experiencing potential COVID-19 vaccine side effects even had suicidal thoughts. “For 24 hrs after [the] shot I was so fatigued I could not stay awake,” one person wrote. “I also have some very strong suicidal thoughts. Zero appetite.”

The reports show that other people struggled with symptoms that were similar to an allergic reaction. One person reported, “I read where [sic] this vaccine should not be administered to anyone allergic to PEG and I am allergic to PEG. It would be incredibly reassuring if someone would call me as all I run into is dead ends.”"

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_841135,"Former President Donald J. Trump has once again made headlines, this time for sharing a potentially game-changing document. Trump shared the letter on Truth Social early Wednesday, from adult film actress Stormy Daniels, dating back to 2018 wherein she denied having had an affair with the former president.
The letter, addressed “To Whom It May Concern,” resurfaced amidst the ongoing investigations into Trump’s alleged payment of hush money to Daniels. In the document, Daniels is quoted denying the affair not due to financial compensation, as previously speculated in numerous reports, but because “it never happened.” The letter stated, “I am denying this affair because I was paid ‘hush money’ as has been reported in overseas owned tabloids. I am denying this affair because it never happened.”
Trump’s social media post accompanying the letter exclaimed, “LOOK WHAT WAS JUST FOUND! WILL THE FAKE NEWS REPORT IT?” He further criticized the media and the Democrats for the “hush money witch hunt,” saying that the letter’s contents should nullify the allegations against him.

The post quickly gained traction on social media, with Trump supporters seeing it as a vindication of the former president. The Stormy Daniels saga began back in 2016 when it was reported that Trump’s then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, had paid Daniels $130,000 as part of a nondisclosure agreement to prevent her from speaking about her alleged affair with Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump has denied the affair and any wrongdoing related to the payment, which has been a focal point of multiple legal inquiries.
The developments have thrust the years-old controversy back into the spotlight.
WATCH:

A trial date has been set for April 15th, pitting Trump against Alvin Bragg, the progressive Manhattan district attorney who elevated Trump’s charges despite historically downgrading felonies for other offenders who have come before his office. The new gag order imposed by Judge Merchan states that Trump may not direct critical statements toward witnesses, court staff, DA Bragg, or other members of the prosecution. Other gag orders have been opposed by Trump’s team in unison with members of the mainstream media. Other criminal matters, including two federal cases and one in Georgia, have faced a series of procedural delays or been sidetracked by scandalous behavior by prosecutors.
The 34 charges, brought forward by DA Bragg, accuse Trump of falsifying business records linked to hush money payments made to Daniels, the former adult film star. The trial was initially set to begin March 25, rejecting Trump’s bid to delay the trial even more.
Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer, pleaded guilty in 2018 to charges including campaign finance violations related to these payments. He claimed that he arranged payments to the women at Trump’s direction. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison but said his actions were taken to protect Trump’s candidacy.
The legal issues revolve around whether these payments constituted illegal campaign contributions. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan initially investigated the payments as part of the broader inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. However, Trump was not charged with any crime as part of that investigation.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_502883,"Mr. Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, was reported to be critically ill and has been admitted to the hospital recently. However, the nature of his hospitalization and his current condition have not been disclosed.

The report has resulted in various reactions from the global community and speculations, especially among social media users.

Schwab, 86, founded the WEF in 1971. Billionaires and leaders in business, politics, and academia assemble in this annual event in Davos, Switzerland, where they tackle political and economic issues. Attendees formulate various ways to “reshape the world,” tackling global economic issues, including environmental sustainability.

Despite posing as a nonprofit foundation, the WEF has long been criticized for its elitism, hypocrisy, lack of transparency, and issues of democracy.

Groups lashed at Schwab and WEF for allowing politicians and elites to dominate the forum. Their policies often reflect and protect the interests of the wealthy instead of the broader population, such as their policy to reduce carbon footprint, while hundreds of its attendees are riding on million-dollar-worth limousines and flying around in private jets.

The forum was also often hounded with transparency issues; one example was the Davos meeting last January, where Swiss banker Hubert Keller discussed how much carbon dioxide coffee production releases into the atmosphere.

“Basically, the coffee that we all drink emits between 15 and 20 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of coffee. So we should all know that this is—every time we drink coffee, we are basically putting CO2 into the atmosphere,” quipped Keller.

If the WEF adopts Keller’s points, millions of coffee growers would soon lose their livelihoods in exchange for “climate justice.”

Australian politician Malcolm Roberts blasted WEF for its hypocrisy, saying: “The elitists at Davos love to chat about restricting travel while comparing the private jets they flew in on. They push EVs, yet the Davos limos are fuel-powered. The forum sessions openly plot to reduce animal farming and fishing, yet they dine on the finest steak and seafood. Where do we draw the line?”

“It’s all part of the plan to make you feel guilty for existing and changing purchases to products owned by WEF-connected billionaires. Reject the CO2 climate scam. One Nation is hugely pro-human and anti-WEF.”

House Republicans also proposed legislation to prevent taxpayers’ dollars from funding the WEF.

Dubbed the Defund Davos Act, this law would disallow any funds accessible to the US Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development, or any other government agency from financing the WEF.

“Forcing American taxpayers to fund annual ski trips for insular, global elitists is absurd—not to mention reprehensible,” remarked Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), one of the bill’s sponsors.

“The World Economic Forum doesn’t deserve one cent of American funding, and it’s past time we defund Davos.”"

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_403987,"The Heartland wasn’t into hearing about who John Mellencamp will be voting for in November.
The outspoken Biden rockstar called it quits in Toledo, Ohio last month after audience members got fed up with his political seminar and demanded more of the songs they came to see. A clip circulating on X shows the moment Mellencamp began trading words with a heckler who yelled at him to “play some music” and stop with the lecturing.
“What do you think I’ve been doing, you c**********?” the singer shoots back. “You don’t f****** know me.”
Despite being backed up with polite applause, the “Pink Houses” rocker became too triggered to continue much longer. He told another heckler to “go back to kindergarten” after the man yelled out, “Play ‘The Authority Song’,” a hit from the 1983 album “Uh-huh,” according to the Toledo Blade.
“Guys, I can stop this show right now and just go home,” Mellencamp responds. “Tell you what I’m going to do. Since you’ve been so wonderful, I’m going to cut about 10 songs out of the show. Here we go.”
He then broke into an acoustic rendition of his hit “Jack & Diane” before leaving the stage.
“Know what? Show’s over,” he said as he walked off.

WATCH:

Known for interspersing politics with his songs, Mellencamp, 72, has played for over five decades and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. His style has blended with peers like Bruce Springsteen, and the show opened with shots of working-class families and blue-collar Americans from various movies over the years.
The heckling marred a performance of “Longest Days,” and after Mellencamp left the stage many in the audience began to leave. About five minutes later, the lights dimmed again and the singer walked back out after the hecklers had been removed, continuing on with “Rain On the Scarecrow,” “Lonely Ol’ Night,” and “Pink Houses.”
Run-ins with patriotic audience members aren’t new to the “Hurts So Bad” rocker.
In May of 2023, Mellencamp lost it during a show in Cleveland after an audience member yelled out, “Play the f****** music!” after he criticized the United States, according to Cleveland.com.
“Listen, hey, you guys, if these people don’t shut the (expletive) up I’m just going to leave, OK? Because I’m not used to this crap,” Mellencamp said. “Look, guys, if I wanted to play in this type of drunken environment, I’d play outside or I’d play in an arena.”
The lifelong progressive singer has surrounded himself with Democratic former presidents like Barack Obama and targeted former President Donald Trump since his first day in the White House.
One day before President Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, Mellencamp released a new music video titled “Easy Target” in which he sings his views on the downtrodden state of a racist America, according to People Magazine.
“So Black Lives Matter, who we tryin’ to kid / Here’s an easy target / Don’t matter, never did / Crosses burnin’, such a long time ago / 400 years, and we still don’t let it go / Well, let the poor be damned and the easy targets, too / All are created equally, beneath you and me.”
“Slowly but surely this country changes by the men we admire and I’m very aware of that,” he told Katie Couric. “The country is changing by what has happened and, you know, welcome to Suckertown.”
When asked for his thoughts on Trump taking office, Mellencamp said: “You don’t really know what he’s really going to do or what because he says one thing and does another. You know, ‘We’re not going to have Wall Street involved,’ and his whole cabinet is Wall Street. I’m just going to sit back and see how weird it gets.”"

Women are upset at Trump’s naughty words -- they also bought 80 million copies of 50 Shades of Gray.

Not one feminist has defended Sarah Sanders. It seems women’s rights only matter if those women are liberal.

No Border Walls. No voter ID laws. Did you figure it out yet? But wait... there's more.

Chelsea Clinton got out of college and got a job at NBC that paid $900,000 per year. Her mom flies around the country speaking out about white privilege.

And just like that, they went from being against foreign interference in our elections to allowing non-citizens to vote in our elections.

President Trump’s wall costs less than the Obamacare website. Let that sink in, America.

We are one election away from open borders, socialism, gun confiscation, and full-term abortion nationally. We are fighting evil.

They sent more troops and armament to arrest Roger Stone than they sent to defend Benghazi.

60 years ago, Venezuela was 4th on the world economic freedom index. Today, they are 179th and their citizens are dying of starvation. In only 10 years, Venezuela was destroyed by democratic socialism.

Russia donated $0.00 to the Trump campaign. Russia donated $145,600,000 to the Clinton Foundation. But Trump was the one investigated!

Nancy Pelosi invited illegal aliens to the State of the Union. President Trump Invited victims of illegal aliens to the State of the Union. Let that sink in.

A socialist is basically a communist who doesn’t have the power to take everything from their citizens at gunpoint ... Yet!

How do you walk 3000 miles across Mexico without food or support and show up at our border 100 pounds overweight and with a cellphone?

Alexandria Ocasio Cortez wants to ban cars, ban planes, give out universal income and thinks socialism works. She calls Donald Trump crazy.

Bill Clinton paid $850,000 to Paula Jones To get her to go away. I don’t remember the FBI raiding his lawyer’s office.

I wake up every day and I am grateful that Hillary Clinton is not the president of the United States of America.

The same media that told me Hillary Clinton had a 95% chance of winning now tells me Trump’s approval ratings are low.

“The problem with socialism is that sooner or later you run out of other people’s money.”— Margaret Thatcher.

----
To Ismail Haniya, and the leaders and operatives of Hamas:
We, the people of Israel, owe you a huge debt of gratitude. You have succeeded where we have failed. Because never before, in the history of the modern State of Israel, has the Jewish people been so united, like one person with one heart. Everyone in Israel, from Left to Right, secular and religious, in united in the knowledge that there is no accommodating an enemy that is sworn to the genocide of our people.
And now, as you continue to launch deadly missiles indiscriminately, intended to maim and murder as many civilians as possible, while you take cowardly refuge behind your own civilians - you continue to inspire us to hold strongly onto our unity. Whatever disputes we Jews may have with each other, we now know that we have one common goal: we will defeat you.
But we are offering you now one last chance. Within 24 hours, all rocket fire - and I mean all rocket fire - will cease. Completely. Forever.
I give you formal notice that our tanks are massed at the Gaza border, with artillery and air support at the ready. We have already dropped leaflets over the northern parts of the Gaza strip, warning civilians of our impending arrival, and that they should evacuate southward, forthwith. If you fail to meet our ultimatum, we are coming in, and, with God's help, this time we will not leave. Every centimeter of land that we conquer will be annexed to Israel, so that there will *never* be another attack launched at our civilians from there.
Even so, we will continue to keep the door open to allow you to surrender gracefully. The moment you announce that you are laying down arms, we will halt our advance, and there we will draw our new borders. If you continue to attack our citizens, we will continue to roll southwards, driving you out of territory that you will never again contaminate with your evil presence.
It pains me deeply that your civilians will be made homeless. But we did not choose this war; you did.

Politifact_FALSE_Social media_995046,"⁉ 90% of Americans Do NOT Support Universal Background Checks - HR 8
On Wednesday, California House Representative Mike Thompson claimed that 90 percent of Americans Support the universal background check gun control bill HR 8.
I’m here to tell you today that this is not true. The Anti-Gun Lobby has been making this lie up for years.
They’ve been saying this for so long I did a video about it in 2012.
If 90% of Americans supported universal background checks we wouldn’t still be having this conversation in 2021.
The 90% of Americans Support universal background checks line is a shaming shamming tactic designed to artificially manufacture groupthink.
They say it so that you feel guilty if you don’t agree, because if 90% of Americans support it then something must be wrong with you if you don’t.
The Anti-Gun Lobby and their “bought and paid for” politicians tried to pass universal background checks in 2013 using the same tired lie of a line that 90% of Americans support universal background checks, but the bill didn’t pass.
A week after the bill failed a Gallup poll found that only 65% of Americans thought the Senate should have passed a bill to “Expand Background checks for gun purchases.” I’m not a math genius, but that ain’t 95%.
This is what they do, a bunch of little power-hungry weirdos put together these misleading little studies not to find an answer, but to manufacture the answer they want, so they can create a false authority and use it to manipulate you.
Universal Background checks are stupid because there’s no way to enforce them without a national database with every gun sold, which would be the very definition of a national gun registry.
I assure you that if you asked Americans if they were ok with the government having a national database with all of their information and all the guns they own they wouldn’t get the support of 90%.
Yet, the only way to enforce a universal background check is to have a national gun registry, but they know they can’t ask that question and get the support they want.
So instead they ask a vague milk-toast question like, “Do you Support Background Checks” knowing damn well very few people are going to say no to that sophomoric question on the surface, but if you explain to them what you’d need to enforce it, they’d say hell no!
They’re going to vote on this silly HR 8 bill in the House very soon, I wouldn’t be surprised if by the time you watched this it’s already passed in the House.
Our best chance at stopping this bill is in the Senate because the most powerful tool we have to fight this bill is the filibuster and ironically, our biggest ally to protect the filibuster is a democrat and his name is Joe Manchin of West Virginia.
Joe Manchin is a moderate Democrat, which means he doesn’t blindly placate the extremist in his party.
In order to get rid of the filibuster, there has to be 51 votes. Right now the Senate is split 50/50 between democrats and republicans giving Kamala Harris the deciding vote.
But none of that matters if Manchin doesn’t vote along party lines. He has a history of being an independent thinker so this is very possible.
On top of this, Manchin prides himself on being a politician of his constitutes.
I say all that to say this- anyone watching this video needs to write, call, email, smoke signal, slide in DMs, or whatever way you choose to communicate, and politely let Joe Manchin know why he should not vote to get rid of the filibuster.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_979683,"Merriam-Webster is again redefining language to fit a narrative, this time framing its definition of “anti-vaxxer” to include not only people who oppose vaccination, but also those who are against inoculation mandates.
The definition on Merriam-Webster's website says “anti-vaxxer” means “a person who opposes vaccination or laws that mandate vaccination.” It’s not clear when it was written to include opposition to forced jabs, but many observers noticed for the first time on Wednesday.
“Welcome to ‘1984.’ This is the Ministry of Truth,” rapper and podcaster Zuby said on Twitter, referring to George Orwell’s dystopian novel.

Other reactions were similar, with many commenters noting that they now fit the dictionary definition of “anti-vaxxer,” even though they believe in the benefits of vaccinations and choose to receive the shots themselves. Merriam-Webster's definition appears to dismiss the concept of favoring a product personally but being opposed, on principle, to forcing others to use it.

“Today, I begin my new life as an anti-vaxxer,” podcast host Matt Walsh said. The conservative Young America’s Foundation added that “when the Left control the language, they control the narrative.”

Such was the case – or at least the attempt – last October, when Merriam-Webster edited its definition of “preference,” noting that it was “offensive” in reference to a person’s “sexual preference.” The revision helped back up US Senator Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) when she accused Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett of being biased against gay people when she used the term as a synonym for ”sexual orientation.”

And last June, Merriam-Webster expanded its definition of “racism” to include “systemic oppression” of one racial group by another. That revision reportedly came in response to a Black Lives Matter activist who suggested the change after losing arguments with people who said they weren’t racist because they didn't consider their own ethnicity to be inherently superior.
“Anti-vaxxer” was the most-searched definition Wednesday on Merriam-Webster’s website. Users of the site posted comments under the definition, complaining of “politics in the dictionary.” One observer said, “I, along with most of America, do not believe that trusting vaccines is synonymous with mandating them. We can't even trust the dictionary anymore.”
The term “anti-vaxxer” is relatively new, having entered the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 2009, and is used by media outlets and political commentators as a pejorative – like “9/11 truthers” and “birthers” – to brand vaccine skeptics as unhinged conspiracy theorists. 
But as National Review pointed out on Wednesday, the latest Merriam-Webster definition classifies 79% of Americans as anti-vaxxers. A Morning Consult poll in December found that only 21% of respondents favored forced vaccinations.
Merriam-Webster tweaked its definition of “vaccine” in January, apparently to make it more friendly to the new mRNA-type inoculations that were created to prevent the spread of Covid-19."

Unfortunately, many have forgotten and still countless others have never known how Ms. Fonda betrayed not only the idea of our country, but specific men who served and sacrificed during the Vietnam War.

The first part of this is from an F-4E pilot. The pilot's name is Jerry Driscoll, a River Rat. In 1968, the former Commandant of the USAF Survival School was a POW in Ho LoPrison, the ""Hanoi Hilton.""

Dragged from a stinking cesspit of a cell, cleaned, fed, and dressed in clean PJ's, he was ordered to describe for a visiting American ""peace activist"" the ""lenient and humane treatment"" he'd received.

He spat at Ms. Fonda, was clubbed, and was dragged away. During the subsequent beating, he fell forward onto the camp commandant 's feet, which sent that officer berserk.

In 1978, the Air Force Colonel still suffered from double vision (which permanently ended his flying career) from the Commandant's frenzied application of a wooden baton.

From 1963-65, Col. Larry Carrigan was in the 47FW/DO (F-4E's). He spent 6 years in the ""Hanoi Hilton"". . . The first three of which his family only knew he was ""missing in action."" His wife lived on faith that he was still alive. His group, too, got the cleaned-up, fed and clothed routine in preparation for a ""peace delegation"" visit.

They, however, had time and devised a plan to get word to the world that they were alive and still survived. Each man secreted a tiny piece of paper, with his Social Security Number on it, in the palm of his hand. When paraded before Ms. Fonda and a cameraman, she walked the line, shaking each man's hand and asking little encouraging snippets like: ""Aren't you sorry you bombed babies?"" and ""Are you grateful for the humane treatment from your benevolent captors?"" Believing this HAD to be an act, they each palmed her their sliver of paper.

She took them all without missing a beat. . . At the end of the line and once the camera stopped rolling, to the shocked disbelief of the POWs, she turned to the officer in charge and handed him all the little pieces of paper... 
Three men died from the subsequent beatings. Colonel Carrigan was almost number four but he survived, which is the only reason we know of her actions that day.

I was a civilian economic development adviser in Vietnam, and was captured by the North Vietnamese communists in South Vietnam in 1968, and held prisoner for over 5 years.

I spent 27 months in solitary confinement; one year in a cage in Cambodia; and one year in a 'black box' in Hanoi. My North Vietnamese captors deliberately poisoned and murdered a female missionary, a nurse in a leprosarium in Banme Thuot, South Vietnam, whom I buried in the jungle near the Cambodian border. At one time, I weighed only about 90 lbs. (My normal weight is 170 lbs.)

We were Jane Fonda's ""war criminals.""

When Jane Fonda was in Hanoi, I was asked by the camp communist political officer if I would be willing to meet with her. I said yes, for I wanted to tell her about the real treatment we POWs received. . . and how different it was from the treatment purported by the North Vietnamese, and parroted by her as ""humane and lenient.""

Because of this, I spent three days on a rocky floor on my knees, with my arms outstretched with a large steel weight placed on my hands, and beaten with a bamboo cane.

I had the opportunity to meet with Jane Fonda soon after I was released. I asked her if she would be willing to debate me on TV. She never did answer me.

These first-hand experiences do not exemplify someone who should be honored as part of ""100 Years of Great Women."" Lest we forget. . . ""100 Years of Great Women"" should never include a traitor whose hands are covered with the blood of so many patriots.

There are few things I have strong visceral reactions to, but Hanoi Jane's participation in blatant treason, is one of them. Please take the time to forward to as many people as you possibly can. It will eventually end up on her computer, and she needs to know that we will never forget."

Other scientists warned the CDC as well as similar scientific entities worldwide, months earlier. Yet here we are.

The solution would be to STOP vaccinating with these terrible Gs and start treating everyone at high risk and those not at high risk who are symptomatic with cheap safe and effective hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin until the virus is driven out.

Jane Doe also claimed that Trump tied her to a bed in a “savage sexual attack” in which he raped her and, when she begged him to stop, slapped her in the face and threatened to have her family “physically harmed if not killed” if she told anyone.

“Defendant Trump stated that I shouldn’t ever say anything if I didn’t want to disappear like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third incident, and that he was capable of having my whole family killed,” Jane Doe alleged.

Health Effects Of EMF Exposure

In a letter addressed to the heads of the United Nations and the World Health Organization, a group of scientists expressed concern over the public's increased exposure to non-ionizing electromagnetic fields (EMF) generated by electric and wireless devices.

They cited scientific studies that showed the ill effects of EMF, which include increased cancer risk, genetic damages, neurological disorders and learning deficits, among others.

Apple's Airpods Emit EMF Radiation

The scientists' appeal comes amid increasing popularity of wireless devices such as Apple's Airpods, which use Bluetooth technology and emits EMF radiation.

The Airpods has become Apple's most popular accessory. In 2017, Apple sold between 14 and 16 million pairs of AirPods and analysts expect the number will reach 50 to 55 million this year.

""Over 1 billion iPhone users worldwide offer great potential growth opportunities for AirPods,"" TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a research note released last year.

Airpods and similar devices comply with the legal limits for EMF radio waves but the scientists who signed the petition worry that the guidelines are too lax. They called for stronger guidelines and demanded that the public be informed about the risks posed by radio waves.

""By not taking action, the WHO is failing to fulfill its role as the preeminent international public health agency,"" the experts wrote.

Dangers Of Using Wireless Headphones

Experts say the use of wireless earphones such as the Airpod is particularly concerning because the device is worn in the ear canal.

University of Colorado biochemistry professor Jerry Phillips, who is one of the scientists who signed the petition, explained that placing the Airpods in the ear canal exposes the tissues in the head to high amounts of radio-frequency radiation. Phillips said this poses a risk for tumors and other conditions linked to abnormal cell functioning."

If breastfeeding is not possible, women deserve next-best options.  Donor milk is one.  There are organizations that help connect women with donors, as well as milk banks in some areas (although banks pasteurize the milk and can be very expensive).
Finally, there is formula.  If you are struggling to find formula options, you can order online, or try a homemade formula.  Not all homemade formulas are nutritionally balanced (don't opt for canned milk and corn syrup!), so you must be careful what you choose.

The great misdiagnosis!! 
C o V I D pneumonia is actually mast cell degranulation of the lungs!! Put simply, it's an allergic reaction occurring after the viral phase ends, most likely to something in the viral particles left over after the body deals with the virus. The reason you can't tell it's an allergic reaction is because it's happening in the lungs, so you experience only symptoms of chest tightness and fatigue!
Dr. Shankara Chetty of South Africa has closely monitored and treated over 8000 patients personally. He noticed there was something very different about viral pneumonia in comparison to C-V pneumonia and was determined to figure out what the mechanism of treatment should be. He had all of his patients come in as soon as they expressed any symptoms, he followed the progression of everyone's disease pattern and noticed something very interesting which resulted in his findings.
Every person progressed the same for the first 5 days, all of them, even those who eventually went on to worsen, appeared to improve around that 5th to 6th day. But from that day forward, there were two distinct camps...one group would always go on to improve after that initial period, but the other group would suddenly worsen on day 8. Not day 7 or 9, always day 8, and they would be fine day 7, while going on to develop what we've come to recognize as C-V pneumonia. But it's not pneumonia at all!
Dr. Chetty knew the pattern of expression for pneumonia of all kinds and this C-V ""pneumonia"" wasn't behaving like any other form of pneumonia. In fact, the flow of oxygen wasn't restricted at all, like in pneumonia. Patients were showing a restriction to lung expansion, but not air flow and it was coming on rapidly, unlike pneumonia. The lung itself was inflamed and couldn't expand. 
It was then that he recognized the similarity this condition had with an allergic reaction. The second an allergic reaction happens, inflammation creates instant symptoms. In peanut allergies for example, you eat a peanut and your face swells up.  Pneumonia is progressive, not instant like this.
As it turns out, this illness is biphasic, meaning there could potentially be two phases of illness and it's the second phase where mortality and morbidity occur. 
He had a critically ill patient, who had diabetes, hypertension and her oxygen saturation was in the 80's, both pre-existing conditions are co-morbidities of C-V. He treated her with a high dose steroid and added in an antihistamine. 
When he called to check on her the next day, her oxygen levels were normal and she progressed on to full health.
It's important to note here too that none of his patients have experienced complications of C o V I D or long haulers. He has since begun working with long hauler's cases though and even in their testing, he is discovering that it's related to mast cell degranulation - aka - histamine!! . He may be the ONLY doctor tracking this illness so closely. Although, I have noticed that the I-MASK protocols have been altered to include Singulair. 
Add antihistamines to your C protocol!"

But here's the problem with that:
Chicken pox is a virus. Lots of people have had it, and probably don't think about it much once the initial illness has passed. But it stays in your body and lives there forever, and maybe when you're older, you have debilitatingly painful outbreaks of shingles. You don't just get over this virus in a few weeks, never to have another health effect. We know this because it's been around for years, and has been studied medically for years.
Herpes is also a virus. And once someone has it, it stays in your body and lives there forever, and anytime they get a little run down or stressed-out they're going to have an outbreak. Maybe every time you have a big event coming up (school pictures, job interview, big date) you're going to get a cold sore. For the rest of your life. You don't just get over it in a few weeks. We know this because it's been around for years, and been studied medically for years.
HIV is a virus. It attacks the immune system, and makes the carrier far more vulnerable to other illnesses. It has a list of symptoms and negative health impacts that goes on and on. It was decades before viable treatments were developed that allowed people to live with a reasonable quality of life. Once you have it, it lives in your body forever and there is no cure. Over time, that takes a toll on the body, putting people living with HIV at greater risk for health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, diabetes, bone disease, liver disease, cognitive disorders, and some types of cancer. We know this because it has been around for years, and had been studied medically for years.
Now with COVID-19, we have a novel virus that spreads rapidly and easily. The full spectrum of symptoms and health effects is only just beginning to be catalogued, much less understood. 
So far the symptoms reported include:
Fever
Fatigue
Coughing 
Pneumonia
Chills/Trembling
Acute respiratory distress
Lung damage (potentially permanent)
Loss of taste (a troubling neurological symptom) 
Sore throat 
Headaches
Difficulty breathing
Mental confusion
Diarrhea 
Nausea or vomiting
Loss of appetite
Strokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19 (even in the relatively young)
Swollen eyes
Blood clots 
Seizures 
Liver damage
Kidney damage
Rash
COVID toes (weird, right?)
People testing positive for COVID-19 have been documented to be sick even after 60 days. Many people are sick for weeks, get better, and then experience a rapid and sudden flare up and get sick all over again.
A man in Seattle was hospitalized for 62 days, and while well enough to be released, still has a long road of recovery ahead of him. Not to mention a $1.1 million medical bill.
Then there is MIS-C. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is a condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. Children with MIS-C may have a fever and various symptoms, including abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes, or feeling extra tired. While rare, it has caused deaths.
This disease has not been around for years. It has basically been 6 months. No one knows yet the long-term health effects, or how it may present itself years down the road for people who have been exposed. We literally *do not know* what we do not know.
For those in our society who suggest that people being cautious are cowards, for people who refuse to take even the simplest of precautions to protect themselves and those around them, I want to ask, without hyperbole and in all sincerity:
How dare you? 
How dare you risk the lives of others so cavalierly. How dare you decide for others that they should welcome exposure as ""getting it over with"", when literally no one knows who will be the lucky ""mild symptoms"" case, and who may fall ill and die. Because while we know that some people are more susceptible to suffering a more serious case, we also know that 20 and 30 year olds have died, marathon runners and fitness nuts have died, children and infants have died. 
How dare you behave as though you know more than medical experts, when those same experts acknowledge that there is so much we don't yet know, but with what we DO know, are smart enough to be scared of how easily this is spread, and recommend baseline precautions such as:
Frequent hand-washing
Physical distancing
Reduced social/public contact or interaction
Mask wearing
Covering your cough or sneeze
Avoiding touching your face
Sanitizing frequently touched surfaces
The more things we can all do to mitigate our risk of exposure, the better off we all are, in my opinion. Not only does it flatten the curve and allow health care providers to maintain levels of service that aren't immediately and catastrophically overwhelmed; it also reduces unnecessary suffering and deaths, and buys time for the scientific community to study the virus in order to come to a more full understanding of the breadth of its impacts in both the short and long term. 
I reject the notion that it's ""just a virus"" and we'll all get it eventually. What a careless, lazy, heartless stance. Being intentional and taking basic, common sense precautions has permitted me to avoid many common viruses. I've never had the flu. And while I'm not saying I never will, I also am not about to run out and intentionally expose myself to ""get it over with""."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_207666,"A Maine couple last week finally got the answers they’d been seeking for nearly a year, ever since their 62-day-old son, Sawyer, died Oct. 28, 2022 — 34 hours after receiving his scheduled childhood vaccines.

According to a toxicology report, Sawyer’s blood contained 95 micrograms per liter of aluminum, a level that would be toxic for adults.

A toxicologist told the couple the aluminum and antigen levels in the blood were due to the vaccines. She also said a viral infection Sawyer was being treated for could have been a contributing factor.

Sawyer’s parents, Melissa — a registered nurse — and her fiancé Nick shared their story last week with journalist Jennifer Margulis.

In an interview this week with The Defender, the couple detailed their search for truth, beginning with how Maine’s medical examiner refused repeated requests to perform lab tests that might have shown the culpability of the vaccines — and instead initially ruled Sawyer’s death “asphyxiation due to inappropriate sleep position and environment.”

The story of baby Sawyer

On Oct. 20, 2022, Melissa took Sawyer to a doctor for a persistent rash around his torso. The doctor diagnosed a viral infection, gave Melissa some medicinal cream and told her to monitor Sawyer’s temperature for possible fever.

Exactly one week later, Melissa went to the same pediatrician for a baby wellness checkup, where the doctor insisted Sawyer, despite Melissa’s reservations and the baby still having a rash, receive the scheduled childhood vaccines.

These included: RotaTeq (for rotavirus), Hib (for Haemophilus influenzae b), Prevnar 13 (for 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria) and Pediarix (for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and polio).

Dr. Lawrence Palevsky, a pediatrician, told The Defender, “I don’t know of any official warnings against vaccinating sick children,” but “there are no upsides to vaccinating a sick child. There are only downsides.” He added, “And, there are no upsides to vaccinating any child.”

Melissa told The Defender that, despite her medical training, she became skeptical of vaccines just two days prior when she watched a video of a toxicologist talking about the dangers of vaccines for children. She discussed the upcoming vaccinations with her fiancé, and they decided to go ahead with them.

“We were afraid that the medical system was going to judge him and judge us and not let him into school,” Nick said. “We just hadn’t done any research on it.” 

Nick has two daughters from a previous marriage, ages 11 and 19, who received all of their childhood vaccines “and nothing ever happened,” he said.

After the doctor’s visit, Sawyer arrived home screaming and Melissa gave him the baby Tylenol recommended by the doctor.

By the next day, the baby had calmed somewhat but was still acting “fussy and uncomfortable,” so Melissa gave him more Tylenol and some expressed breastmilk.

When Nick got home from work that day, they put Sawyer into his bassinet for a nap around 5:30. By 6:15 the baby was fussing, and with some help was able to get back to sleep. He slept off and on for another four hours, while his parents kept tabs on him via his baby monitor and visits to his room.

The last time Melissa checked on Sawyer, he wasn’t moving or breathing. She picked up his limp and lifeless body and started screaming. Nick rushed in to help but it was already too late.

Emergency medical technicians arrived after the couple called 911. They tried but were unable to revive Sawyer.

The county and state police also responded and, because it was an infant death, opened a formal investigation and ordered an autopsy.

Chief Medical Examiner Mark Flomenbaum performed the autopsy the next day. Although he found Sawyer to be “well developed” and without signs of injury or bruising, Flomenbaum filed a death certificate citing asphyxiation due to a “sub-optimal sleeping environment” — essentially blaming the parents.

“It was near Christmas when we got the autopsy results,” Melissa told The Defender. “We read them on Christmas Eve. … We did nothing for the entire weekend.”

Asked if they ever learned what the medical examiner saw to make his determination, they said no. “The only thing in his basket was the blanket he was laying on.”

The police looked for evidence of child abuse or alcoholism, but quickly concluded it was an accidental death.

Melissa, grief-stricken, told everyone she could to investigate the possible role of vaccines in Sawyer’s death. 

She first called the medical examiner to see if he would do testing to determine if sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) was responsible, but was told there was no need “because it wouldn’t show the cause of his passing,” she recalled being told.

The hunt for answers

That’s when the couple’s hunt for answers began. “I was looking up people on the internet, on social media. I was calling any number I could find,” Melisssa said.

Finally, she discovered a suite of pathology tests that could determine whether vaccines played a role in Sawyer’s death.

The tests measure C-reactive protein (indicating brain inflammation), liver enzymes, aluminum and mercury in brain and blood tissue, formaldehyde and formalin (another name for formaldehyde). A cytokine panel would also identify various blood factors and vaccine titer levels.

Melissa mailed and emailed Flomenbaum’s office to formally request the full battery of tests. The doctor refused, dismissing her concerns and telling her that heavy metals do not cause SIDS.

“They gave me a reason why each test didn’t need to be done,” she said.

Further emails to the state medical examiner’s office, from both parents, have been bouncing back as “undeliverable” since.

A friend of Melissa’s told her about Health Choice Maine, a statewide nonprofit working to protect health freedom and parental rights. There she met Tiffany Kreck, Health Choice Maine’s executive director, who helped Melissa organize her own investigation.

“Families being bullied by a doctor or threatened with CPS [child protective services] or whatever, can reach out, and we will, to the best of our ability, help them navigate it,” Kreck told The Defender. 

Melissa said Tiffany gave her a list of things they had to do, “like getting reports and billing information, people to contact, and that’s what I did.” 

Their primary goal was to find a competent pathologist to perform the lab tests Melissa had requested. They searched the entire country — even enlisting the help of Laura Bono, vice president of Children’s Health Defense, Kreck told The Defender — but came up empty.

Kreck told Melissa they would not be mentioning anything about vaccines to the prospective pathologists, so they would be less likely to reject the request. 

The biggest obstacle was finding a doctor who was willing to order the tests.

Her OB-GYN told her that it was “out of his scope of practice.”

She called her primary care physician and told him she thought the vaccines had played a role in her son’s death “and he denied it,” she said. Her pediatrician also said no.

The toxicology report and next steps

Finally, they found someone in-state who, responding to Melissa’s grief, agreed to perform the tests on June 21. Although some of Sawyer’s tissue samples had degraded, the pathologist was able to perform enough tests to issue a definitive report last month.

The report was technical and was not accompanied by any guidance or recommendations.

Melissa said, “They never called me and said, ‘Oh, listen, this is high. This could be due to his vaccines.’ We will do a VAERS [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System] report, you know, and advocate for other infants that pass away. No, we didn’t get anything from them.”

So they had to hire a private toxicologist who could interpret the report. That second report arrived last week.

“And she was the one that called us the other day and told us that his aluminum levels were very high,” Melissa said, “and that we needed to seek some legal services.”

The report showed baby Sawyer had 95 micrograms of aluminum per liter of blood, a level that would be toxic for adults. The toxicologist told the couple the aluminum and antigen levels in the blood were due to the vaccines. She also said the baby’s illness could have been a contributing factor.

Kreck told Margulis, “This additional pathology report shows how much our medical examiners don’t know because they won’t look.”

The report also showed high levels of lead, which would not be due to vaccines, the toxicologist said, and asked about lead levels in their house or water. But given that the baby had only consumed breastmilk and was not yet old enough to crawl around on the floor, the question remains open.

After receiving the confirmation about the aluminum, the couple felt “exonerated” from the implication they were responsible for Sawyer dying from asphyxiation, “but we also still feel like we failed our baby,” Melissa told The Defender.

“Me being a nurse,” she said, “I felt like I failed him both as a nurse and a mother.”

Nick added, “From the father’s standpoint, you’re supposed to protect your family, and I failed at that. It weighs on me every second of the day.”

Melissa and Nick are planning to file a claim with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). She said she still feels skeptical “because I know how the government and the medical system are.”

Kreck is helping the couple prepare for the VICP meeting. “We are doing every test that we can possibly do and trying to cross all of our t’s and dot all of our i’s before we go into the VICP,” Kreck said, “which is historically difficult and harsh on what they perceive to be SIDS cases.”  

The couple told The Defender they got help reporting the case to VAERS last November, but have never received any follow-up. They did, however, confirm that Sawyer’s case was in the database.

Health Choice Maine is also exploring options for a lawsuit challenging the finding on the state medical examiner’s death certificate. 

Dealing with the grief

Just three months after the ordeal, a therapist told Melissa, who was still grieving for her child and searching for answers, that she had an “adjustment disorder.”

“She was pretty much telling me that I was not adjusting to losing my son quick enough, and recommended trauma therapy,” Melissa said.

She left the office crying, wondering if something was wrong with her or not being able to let go of her grief. “I haven’t had good luck with therapists,” she told The Defender.

“I’ve been going through this all on my own, trying to go through reports and all the information about my baby’s life and his medical records. And I’m doing all this while trying to grieve the loss of him and it is horrifically painful,” she said. “It’s something no parent should ever have to go through.”

One therapist told Melissa to take mood stabilizers and anti-depressants. “The mental health care system has not been very helpful in this at all,” Nick added. 

Nick found that going back to work and keeping busy was the most therapeutic approach for him. “Just keeping my mind focused on other stuff, you know, while carrying all that around,” he said. 

Nick has joined Melissa in several of her therapy sessions, which he found very helpful.

The couple found a grief support group called Empty Arms for parents who have lost a child, which has been “amazing,” Melissa said. The group does a butterfly release for the deceased on Memorial Day and an annual remembrance walk.

They have found support from family members as well, although Melissa said it has been hard to talk to her family about the vaccine connection.

The couple said the loss has brought them closer together. “I couldn’t keep going, fighting the fight we’re fighting right now, without her,” Nick said. “And you don’t realize how much you love someone and just how precious life is and what you have in front of you is.”

“Cherish it and love it, don’t let it go,” he said.

“We lost the biggest and best part of us both and if we didn’t stay together, I’d feel like I was losing another piece,” Melissa said.

The couple’s journey to warn others

“I just want to make other people aware and I want to put a stop to this,” Melissa said.

Melissa said she warns mothers of sick children to cancel their appointments for vaccines at least until the child has recovered. She added:

“Children do not need vaccines. And if they were to get them, they don’t need them until they’re at least 2 years old. The problem is, is they have a blood-brain barrier that has not closed up until they’re 2 years old or later. 

“And if you get vaccinated before 2 years old, the aluminum can cross that blood-brain barrier. That’s why levels are so high and it stops respiration and causes cardiac arrest.”

Nick said, “I wouldn’t tell anybody ‘Don’t vaccinate your children.’ But I would definitely say ‘Do your research. Go to the end of the internet, make sure what you’re doing is right, that you know all the possible outcomes.’”

“Be more educated and be a strong advocate for your baby,” he added. “Because it’s your baby, not the doctor’s.” 

Asked why more medical professionals don’t speak out, Melissa simply said “Career suicide.”

“I don’t even wanna be a nurse anymore,” she said. “Why would I want to be? But I have to pay my bills.”

“Doctors don’t have any better education on vaccines than most 10th graders,” she said. “Even as a nurse, we don’t get the education. We just got the schedule.” 

She also said that medical examiners should have the right to test for vaccine injuries during the autopsy and identify them as a cause on the death certificate. “The vaccines are killing people and babies and they’re trying to cover it up,” she said.

While the couple said they found it helpful to share their story, they also admitted to wanting to keep a low profile. “It’s kind of a quiet subject for us because we’ve got to protect ourselves now,” Melissa said.

The couple is looking for a good support system. “We’re looking for people to stand behind us and support us as we go through this journey, for the next questionable amount of years, to get justice for our baby. It might drag on for a while,” Melissa said.

When asked about what gives them the strength to stand up and share their story, despite the backlash that such activism could invite, Melissa said:

“This is the only way that I feel like I can mother my baby anymore. And my baby deserves justice. And we deserve to know the truth. 

“He is our reason for living right now. And he is our motivation.”

Questions about the state medical examiner

Kreck told The Defender that state medical examiner Flomenbaum came from Massachusetts where he had been fired as the state medical examiner. “It looks like he tried to sue them for wrongful termination and lost,” Kreck said.

Flomenbaum earned a national reputation as a top medical examiner through his work identifying bodies in New York City after the 9/11 attack in 2001, according to an article in the Portland Press Herald.

He was fired from his Massachusetts position for losing a body and having a backlog of bodies waiting to be examined.

In 2019, the Maine attorney general’s office investigated and later cleared Flomenbaum over criticism that he was running a side business as a consultant in out-of-state death cases.

The Portland Press Herald article details more of Flomenbaum’s controversial history, which included a Connecticut prosecutor’s letter to then-Attorney General Jane Mills telling her that a judge had determined his testimony in a child manslaughter case was “not credible.”

Flomenbaum was reprimanded in 2021 by Maine Governor Mills for inappropriate and unprofessional behavior in the workplace, after which he announced he would not be seeking reassignment to the position. 

“He was only supposed to have a month or so left of his term back then and he’s still in office now. That all sounds very odd and fishy,” Kreck said.

Melissa told The Defender that Flomenbaum had recently left the medical examiner’s office, putting the disposition of Sawyer’s remains in question. 

The couple, with the aid of Health Choice Maine, is seeking to remove Sawyer’s blood and tissue samples from the medical examiner’s office. 

Anyone with information about where a new location might be found to accommodate Sawyer’s remains is encouraged to email Tiffany Kreck at tiffany@healthchoicemaine.org."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_273244,"Silicon Valley Bank donated over $73 million to the ""BLM Movement & Related Causes"" in the years before going insolvent, while failed Signature Bank gave $850,000 to similiar organizations, a database from The Claremont Institute shows.

In the database, the conservative think tank indicated that SVB donated $73,450,000 to social justice groups prior to its downfall in order to bolster its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating. As outlined in prior Newsmax reports, ESG is a de facto social credit score for businesses.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail reported that the New York-based Signature Bank donated $850,000 over the years prior to its Sunday downfall.

While it's unclear how the social justice groups spent the donations, the think tank claims that the Global Network, a BLM private organization, used the money to fund Black Lives Matter demonstrations as well as for contributions to BLM political action committees, which were focused on electing progressive leaders.

Notwithstanding the two failed banks' donations, the database also includes contributions given by some of the biggest banks in the United States. These included Wells Fargo, which donated $210 million; U.S. Bancorp, which donated $503 million; PNC Financial Services, which donated more than $1 billion; CitiGroup, which donated $1.1 billion; Goldman Sachs, which donated over $10.1 billion; Bank of America, which donated over $18.2 billion; and JPMorgan Chase & Co., which donated over $30 billion over the years to BLM causes.

In an op-ed for Newsweek, The Claremont Institute claimed that the Global Network used its money ""to support future operations, purchasing luxury real estate, engaging in nepotism, disbursing grants to dozens of BLM chapters and revolutionary organizations, and operating a PAC to 'elect progressive community leaders, activists, and working-class candidates fighting for black liberation.'""

In the summer of 2020 following the death of George Floyd, SVB pledged, according to its 2021 proxy statement to investors, to increase commitment to ""diversity, equity, and inclusion."" The company's CEO, Greg Becker, announced that SVB had an employee matching program for donations that focused on ""pandemic-response; social justice; sustainability; and supporting women, Black, and Latinx emerging talent and other underrepresented groups.""

Signature Bank executives similarly emphasized their commitment to social caueses. According to the bank's 2021 Social Impact Report, a number of the bank's employees were suggested to have contributed ""throughout 2021, 431 individual grants totaling $1.86 million"" that ""were directed by our Private Client Groups to nonprofit organizations focused on health, education, community service, economic development, affordable housing, the arts, and a wide variety of other causes. This total surpassed 2020 grant giving by approximately 43%.""

""Corporate giving is an essential component of Signature Bank's corporate citizenship,"" the report continued, ""and the bank's commitment to supporting universal social causes will only grow along with the bank's size, strength, and position within the corporate community, national economy, and global society.

""Each year, Signature makes unrestricted grants to numerous not-for-profit organizations and funds specific activities and initiatives for many others.

""With our increased focus on social impact, including practices related to human capital, diversity, equity, and inclusion, along with strategies to support and cultivate community engagement, and our approach to sustainability efforts as individuals and as an institution, the bank continues to strengthen its governance in these areas."""

Politifact_FALSE_Social media_50740,PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ADDRESSING TO THE NATION TODAY UPDATE - TRUMP NEWS
Politifact_FALSE_Social media_66902,🎸 Thank you 𝐓𝐢𝐦 & 𝐅𝐚𝐢𝐭𝐡! I finished last month-59 lighter... It’s melting off while I'm asleep. Just do their 3-sec bedtime routine each night!
Politifact_FALSE_Social media_801448,"Mel Gibson Child Sex-Trafficking Documentary BLOCKED By Hollywood!

Politifact_FALSE_Social media_114484,"You know when you go to Wal-Mart and the grocery store and they have the wipes to clean your cart handle? How many of you don’t use them? Well, I do and I always thought of the germs only. Was told that the police also suggests you do it because of all the problems with drugs, if someone has Fentanyl still on their hands and they touch that cart they transfer it to the cart, then you get it on you, one drop can cause death. Scary but worth taking the time to clean the handle. All you have to do is rub your nose or touch your child’s mouth. Copy and post. I did! This is a scary truth."
Politifact_FALSE_Social media_310739,"Donald Trump has been in the
public eye for over 30 years... ..and he was never once accused of being racist by anyone until he
decided to run against the Democrats."

Politifact_FALSE_Social media_799578,"The USPS is not only a bloated and outdated government agency, it is also ineffective and incompetent. It's been 2 months since my wife went on a Hawaii vacation with her personal trainer; she said she would send me postcards every

Politifact_FALSE_Social media_780433,"This is a boneyard near Paris, France with hundreds of electric powered cars. Mind you these are only cars used by the City of Paris and not personal vehicles. All of these have the same issue,.... the battery storage cells have given out and need replaced. Why not just replace them you ask? Well two reasons. First the battery storage cells cost almost double what the vehicle cost new, and second no landfill or disposals will allow the batteries to be disposed of there. So these green fairy tale electric cars are all sitting in vacant lots while their batteries drain toxins into the ground. 
 Still think we need to go green???
Very interesting

Can anyone confirm? If you are in the Stevensville area or know anyone who is, please have them video tape confirmation and share their videos on this page. 
If that is true it wouldn’t surprise me one bit. He has law abiding citizens fined and arrested for wanting to work and feed their families, while he lets criminals out of prison, sends $1 billion to China and tomorrow begins using more of our tax dollars to pay illegals! What better time to go on vacation than now! Either way he is a criminal that needs to be removed from office and prosecuted!"

Therefore, ma’am, you’re not going to buy off Texans for your green new deal energy pipe dream for $2M.

Now they say there are a couple ways a President doesn't win reelection. Those are an unpopular war or a poor economy.
But there is something larger going on here driving this sudden outbreak right after Trump beats an impeachment. Especially the fact that it(Corona virus)originated in China who we are in a global trade war with brought on by Trump. Let's not forget Biden's back door deals with CHINA as well.
China doesn't want 4 more years of Trump either. It all seems rather convenient for the nations and opponents of our current President and economy 5 months before an election. Couldn't have hit at a more perfect time.
With the Democrats running out of campaign talking points in light of no school shootings, no migrant caravans at the southern border, fighting in Syria winding down, North Korea not firing missiles and Trump beating a sham impeachment. The corona virus gave them one last hail Mary to try and point fingers at Trump with the clock winding down in 2020.
This is almost the perfect fascist playbook. Control the population with fear-mongering and panic, control the media, spread propaganda and the fan-favorite disarm the population. Oh, and did anyone notice that while they are mad as hell at Trump for not sending aid to Ukraine, they THEMSELVES voted AGAINST giving ANY emergency aid to all Americans ?
Sorry but I don't think we are all going to die. Remember when Ebola was what was going to kill us all, and the media kept showing the piles of body bags that were prepared for the fallout. Then a month later it was totally forgotten.
The common flu has killed more people this year already and the media is SILENT!
A handful of deaths out of 320 million Americans and we are in panic tearing down our society and costing our economy billions in the wake. It all just seems fishy, a little too well-timed if you ask me.

Bill Gates, US Chief Infectious Disease Specialist Fauci, and Big Pharma have lost a lawsuit in the US Supreme Court, failing to prove that all of their vaccines over the past 32 years have been safe for the health of citizens!  The lawsuit was filed by a group of scientists led by Senator Kennedy.

 

 Robert F. Kennedy Jr .: “The new COVID vaccine should be avoided at all costs.

 

 I urgently draw your attention to important issues related to the next vaccination against Covid-19.

 

 For the first time in the history of vaccination, the so-called mRNA vaccines of the latest generation directly interfere with the patient's genetic material and therefore alter the individual genetic material, which is genetic manipulation, which was already prohibited and was previously considered a crime.

 The coronavirus VACCINE IS NOT A VACCINE!  ATTENTION!

 What has always been a vaccine?

 It was always the pathogen itself - a microbe or virus that was killed or attenuated, that is, weakened - and it was introduced into the body in order to produce antibodies.

 Not even a coronavirus vaccine!

  She's not that at all!

 It is part of the newest group of mRNA (mRNA) allegedly ""vaccines""

 Once inside a human cell, mRNA reprograms normal RNA / DNA, which begins to make another protein.

 That is, nothing to do with traditional vaccines!  That is, it is an instrument of genetic influence.  Gene weapon!  That is, they were going to destroy from earthlings, and the survivors will become GMOs!

 Following the unprecedented mRNA vaccine, the vaccinated will no longer be able to treat the symptoms of the vaccine in an additional way.

 Vaccinated people will have to come to terms with the consequences, because they can no longer be cured by simply removing toxins from the human body, as in a person with a genetic defect such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, genetic heart failure, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, Rett syndrome, etc.  ), because the genetic defect is forever!

 

 This clearly means:

 if a symptom of vaccination develops after mRNA vaccination, neither I nor any other therapist can help you, because

 DAMAGE CAUSED BY VACCINATION WILL BE GENETICALLY Irreversible.

 

 ❗Vaccination -

  weapons of genocide of the 21st century.

 

 Former Pfizer Chief Scientist Mike Yeedon has once again expressed his position that it is too late now to save those who have been injected with a substance publicly called ""the Covid-19 vaccine.""

 

 He encourages those who have not yet received the lethal injection to fight for their lives, those around them and the lives of their children.

 

 The internationally renowned immunologist goes on to describe a process that he says will kill the vast majority of people:

 ""Immediately after the first vaccination, about 0.8% of people die within two weeks.

 The average life expectancy of survivors will be a maximum of two years, but it also decreases with each new ""injection"". ""

 

 Additional vaccines are still being developed to cause deterioration in certain organs, including the heart, lungs and brain.

 

 After two decades at Pfizer, Professor Yedon was familiar with the functions and research and development goals of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, and states that the ultimate goal of the current ""vaccination"" regime can only be a massive demographic event that will make all world wars put together, like Mickey's staging  Mouse.

 

 ""Billions of people have already been sentenced to certain, inevitable and painful death. Anyone who receives the injection will die prematurely, and three years is a generous estimate of how long they can survive."""

A blogger added up the deer license sales in just a handful of states and arrived at a striking conclusion:
There were over 600,000 hunters this season in the state of Wisconsin ..
Allow me to restate that number: 600,000!
Over the last several months, Wisconsin 's hunters became the eighth largest army in the world.
(That’s more men under arms than in Iran . More than France and Germany combined. )
These men, deployed to the woods of a single American state, Wisconsin, to hunt with firearms,
and NO ONE WAS KILLED.
That number pales in comparison to the 750,000 who hunted the woods ofPennsylvania and
Michigan 's 700,000 hunters, ALL OF WHOM HAVE RETURNED HOME SAFELY.
Toss in a quarter million hunters in West Virginia and it literally establishes the fact that the
hunters of those four states alone would comprise the largest army in the world.
And then add in the total number of hunters in the other 46 states.
It's millions more.
________ The point? _______________________________________
America will forever be safe from foreign invasion with that kind of home-grown firepower!
Hunting... it's not just a way to fill the freezer.
It's a matter of national security.
***************************************
That's why all enemies, foreign and domestic, want to see us disarmed.
Food for thought, when next we consider gun control, whether you agree with it or not.
Overall it's true, so if we disregard some assumptions that hunters
don't possess the same skills as soldiers, the question would still remain...
What army of 2 million would want to face 30 million, 40 million, or 50 million armed citizens???
For the sake of our freedom, don't ever allow gun control or confiscation of guns.
(IF YOU AGREE, AS I DO, PASS IT ON, I FEEL GOOD THAT I HAVE AN ARMY OF MILLIONS WHO WOULD PROTECT OUR LAND AND I SURE DON'T WANT
THE GOVERNMENT TAKING CONTROL OF THE POSSESSION OF FIREARMS)

In a move long thought to have already been done, late last Friday, NCDHHS sent a press release to announce that they have finally employed the first round of vendors to begin testing after over three months since the pandemic affected North Carolina. It is well known that Friday night press releases are meant to fly information under the radar. I too would be embarrassed at this poor performance. The delays and unbelievable scripted press tactics are unconscionable in the middle of a pandemic. It appears that it took a call from Dr. Deborah Birx of the White House’s Coronavirus Task Force to Dr. Cohen regarding the fundamental flaw in North Carolina's approach to testing to finally get this done. Our state’s hospital systems offered assistance months ago and were turned down. We have lost extremely valuable time and resources because of this delay potentially harming our state’s population. 
I have talked about the lack of a coherent plan for testing in North Carolina. I have talked about the lack of transparency in this administration’s approach to the pandemic. This incident speaks to both of these incompetences. It makes one question the reasons for the delay in implementation when the scientific community has repeatedly commented on how important testing is for a successful reopening of our economy. Our surrounding states have had coherent plans for testing, and we are just getting to this now?
We also found out over the weekend that antibody testing conducted by Dr. John Sanders at Wake Forest University showed that over 1 million people in North Carolina have now been exposed to the virus. How could another institution in our state get this done so quickly when the governor’s administration could not? I have repeatedly called on the administration to do antibody testing and so I'm glad at least another institution stepped up to do this. Antibody testing gives a realistic picture of the virus’s prevalence in the community and helps allay people’s fears. Apparently, the administration doesn’t want that. All this talk about the ""Science and the Data"" is deceptive when the ""Science and the Data"" are being manipulated. 
It is a simple fact that more people are testing positive. This result was totally expected. The virus has not disappeared. Hospitalizations are also up but have stabilized. The curve has long since been flattening allowing our hospitals to gather the resources they need. The death rate, which is the most important statistic, has continued to plummet because of excellent patient care and preparedness. Continuing to handcuff the state unnecessarily is not justifiable and cannot continue.
This most recent move by the Cooper administration fits in line with their lack of a competent plan for our nursing homes. Testing in our nursing homes, where our most vulnerable have composed the majority of deaths, should have been done months ago. The fact that it has taken this long to design a plan to protect them is downright scandalous and is in need of immediate investigation."

Ron Howard
January 24 at 5:41 AM
I'm a liberal, but that doesn't mean what a lot of you apparently think it does. Let's break it down, shall we? Because quite frankly, I'm getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for. Spoiler alert: not every liberal is the same, though the majority of liberals I know think along roughly these same lines:

1. I believe a country should take care of its weakest members. A country cannot call itself civilized when its children, disabled, sick, and elderly are neglected. PERIOD.

2. I believe healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Somehow that's interpreted as ""I believe Obamacare is the end-all, be-all."" This is not the case. I'm fully aware that the ACA has problems, that a national healthcare system would require everyone to chip in, and that it's impossible to create one that is devoid of flaws, but I have yet to hear an argument against it that makes ""let people die because they can't afford healthcare"" a better alternative. I believe healthcare should be far cheaper than it is, and that everyone should have access to it. And no, I'm not opposed to paying higher taxes in the name of making that happen.

3. I believe education should be affordable. It doesn't necessarily have to be free (though it works in other countries so I'm mystified as to why it can't work in the US), but at the end of the day, there is no excuse for students graduating college saddled with five- or six-figure debt.

4. I don't believe your money should be taken from you and given to people who don't want to work. I have literally never encountered anyone who believes this. Ever. I just have a massive moral problem with a society where a handful of people can possess the majority of the wealth while there are people literally starving to death, freezing to death, or dying because they can't afford to go to the doctor. Fair wages, lower housing costs, universal healthcare, affordable education, and the wealthy actually paying their share would go a long way toward alleviating this. Somehow believing that makes me a communist.

5. I don't throw around ""I'm willing to pay higher taxes"" lightly. If I'm suggesting something that involves paying more, well, it's because I'm fine with paying my share as long as it's actually going to something besides lining corporate pockets or bombing other countries while Americans die without healthcare.

6. I believe companies should be required to pay their employees a decent, livable wage. Somehow this is always interpreted as me wanting burger flippers to be able to afford a penthouse apartment and a Mercedes. What it actually means is that no one should have to work three full-time jobs just to keep their head above water. Restaurant servers should not have to rely on tips, multibillion-dollar companies should not have employees on food stamps, workers shouldn't have to work themselves into the ground just to barely make ends meet, and minimum wage should be enough for someone to work 40 hours and live.

7. I am not anti-Christian. I have no desire to stop Christians from being Christians, to close churches, to ban the Bible, to forbid prayer in school, etc. (BTW, prayer in school is NOT illegal; *compulsory* prayer in school is - and should be - illegal). All I ask is that Christians recognize *my* right to live according to *my* beliefs. When I get pissed off that a politician is trying to legislate Scripture into law, I'm not ""offended by Christianity"" -- I'm offended that you're trying to force me to live by your religion's rules. You know how you get really upset at the thought of Muslims imposing Sharia law on you? That's how I feel about Christians trying to impose biblical law on me. Be a Christian. Do your thing. Just don't force it on me or mine.

8. I don't believe LGBT people should have more rights than you. I just believe they should have the *same* rights as you.

9. I don't believe illegal immigrants should come to America and have the world at their feet, especially since THIS ISN'T WHAT THEY DO (spoiler: undocumented immigrants are ineligible for all those programs they're supposed to be abusing, and if they're ""stealing"" your job it's because your employer is hiring illegally). I believe there are far more humane ways to handle undocumented immigration than our current practices (i.e., detaining children, splitting up families, ending DACA, etc).

10. I don't believe the government should regulate everything, but since greed is such a driving force in our country, we NEED regulations to prevent cut corners, environmental destruction, tainted food/water, unsafe materials in consumable goods or medical equipment, etc. It's not that I want the government's hands in everything -- I just don't trust people trying to make money to ensure that their products/practices/etc. are actually SAFE. Is the government devoid of shadiness? Of course not. But with those regulations in place, consumers have recourse if they're harmed and companies are liable for medical bills, environmental cleanup, etc. Just kind of seems like common sense when the alternative to government regulation is letting companies bring their bottom line into the equation.

11. I believe our current administration is fascist. Not because I dislike them or because I can’t get over an election, but because I've spent too many years reading and learning about the Third Reich to miss the similarities. Not because any administration I dislike must be Nazis, but because things are actually mirroring authoritarian and fascist regimes of the past.

12. I believe the systemic racism and misogyny in our society is much worse than many people think, and desperately needs to be addressed. Which means those with privilege -- white, straight, male, economic, etc. -- need to start listening, even if you don't like what you're hearing, so we can start dismantling everything that's causing people to be marginalized.

13. I am not interested in coming after your blessed guns, nor is anyone serving in government. What I am interested in is the enforcement of present laws and enacting new, common sense gun regulations. Got another opinion? Put it on your page, not mine.

14. I believe in so-called political correctness. I prefer to think it’s social politeness. If I call you Chuck and you say you prefer to be called Charles I’ll call you Charles. It’s the polite thing to do. Not because everyone is a delicate snowflake, but because as Maya Angelou put it, when we know better, we do better. When someone tells you that a term or phrase is more accurate/less hurtful than the one you're using, you now know better. So why not do better? How does it hurt you to NOT hurt another person?

15. I believe in funding sustainable energy, including offering education to people currently working in coal or oil so they can change jobs. There are too many sustainable options available for us to continue with coal and oil. Sorry, billionaires. Maybe try investing in something else.

16. I believe that women should not be treated as a separate class of human. They should be paid the same as men who do the same work, should have the same rights as men and should be free from abuse. Why on earth shouldn’t they be?

I think that about covers it. Bottom line is that I'm a liberal because I think we should take care of each other. That doesn't mean you should work 80 hours a week so your lazy neighbor can get all your money. It just means I don't believe there is any scenario in which preventable suffering is an acceptable outcome as long as money is saved.

While treating the patients with the virus, Antonio got infected with the virus, but this didn’t break the determination of Susan to help the patients, neither did Antonio stop her from working in the hospital. They kept their duty higher than their family obligations. A week later Sofia also got infected with the virus, and the hospital was out of beds and isolation wards. Sofia had some medical conditions, so the chances of her recovery were feeble. They kept themselves in isolation. Days later, they got a call from hospital that they have a bed for one patient. Antonio insisted Sofia to get admitted , but she didn’t want to leave her husband to die in vain. Few days later they both died holding each others hand, looking after each other, caressing each other. They never got a chance to hug their kids for a final goodbye. 
Cara and lia lost their parents.

I don't care who you are ... Democrat, Republican, or Independent ... liberal or conservative ... blue state or red state ... you have to be appalled at the sheer gall of this woman
Queen Pelosi wasn't happy with the small USAF C-20B jet, Gulfstream III, that comes with the Speaker's job ... OH NO! Queen Pelosi was aggravated that this little jet had to stop to refuel, so she ordered a Big Fat, 200-seat, USAF C-32, Boeing 757 jet that could get her back to California without stopping! I understand that a former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, flew commerical most of the time.

Many, many legislators walked by and grinned with glee as Joe informed everyone of what Queen Nancy's Big Fat Jet costs us, the hard working American tax payers, literally thousands of gallons of fuel every week.
Since she only works 3 days a week, this gas guzzling jet gets fueled and she flies home to California every Friday and returns every Monday, at a cost to the taxpayers (YOU and ME are those taxpayers!) of about $60,000, one way!
As Joe put it ...""unfortunately we have to pay to bring her back on Monday night and that costs us another $60,000!"" Taxpayers, that is $480,000 per month and that is an annual cost to us of $5,760,000!!!
No wonder she complains about the cost of this war ... it might cramp her style and she is styling on my back and yours. I think of the military families in this country doing without and this woman, who heads up the most do-nothing Congress in the history of our country, keeps fueling that jet while doing nothing.

If you think this is outrageous, forward it to all those on your email list! Keep in mind the figures above do NOT include the cost of plane or crew ... just the fuel!!! One has to wonder what the total package costs us?

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_460028,"Clutching her face in despair and weeping, photos of Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seemingly show her strong reaction to a horrific scene of US migrant detention. However, new angles reveal she may have played things up a bit.
While quite a few people noted that there was something a bit off about the senator’s photo shoot at a border detention policy protest that went viral this week, there was nothing concrete to indicate her insincerity... until one gets a look at the massive empty road and parking lot on the other side.

Originally shot at a protest against tent-cities for migrant children at the US-Mexico border in Texas a year ago, the photos were not published until Monday. They came hot on the heels of the scandal surrounding AOC’s insistence that border detention facilities are “concentration camps.”

The initial shots seem almost carefully selected to avoid showing what was on the other side of the chain-link fence... However, when AOC herself reshared them, she attached a comment that hinted it was something bleak indeed.

The rest of the photos from the event show a couple of cars, some trees, and a few street lamps visible on the other side, but not so much in terms of “caged refugee children.”

AOC has been active in her campaign against what she sees as a growing threat at the border. This week, she launched a campaign against the discount furniture company that provides beds for the immigrants."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_313396,"Scientists are scrambling to explain why the continent of Antarctica has shown Net Zero warming for the last seven decades and almost certainly much longer. The lack of warming over a significant portion of the Earth undermines the unproven hypothesis that the carbon dioxide humans add to the atmosphere is the main determinant of global climate.
Under ‘settled’ science requirements, the significant debate over the inconvenient Antarctica data is of necessity being conducted well away from prying eyes in the mainstream media. Promoting the Net Zero political agenda, the Guardian recently topped up readers’ alarm levels with the notion that “unimaginable amounts of water will flow into oceans”, if temperatures in the region rise and ice buffers vanish. The BBC green activist-in-chief Justin Rowlatt flew over parts of the region and witnessed “an epic vision of shattered ice”. He described Antarctica as the “frontline of climate change”. In 2021, the South Pole had its coldest six-month winter since records began in 1957, a fact largely ignored in the mainstream. One-off bad weather promoter Reuters subsequently ‘fact checked’ commentary on the event in social media. It noted that a “six-month period is not long enough to validate a climate trend”.
A recent paper from two climate scientists (Singh and Polvani) accepts that Antarctica has not warmed in the last seven decades, despite an increase in the atmospheric greenhouse gases. It is noted that the two polar regions present a “conundrum” for understanding present day climate change, as recent warming differs markedly between the Arctic and Antarctic. The graph below shows average Antarctica surface temperatures from 1984-2014, compared to a base period 1950-1980.

The scientists note that over the last seven decades, the Antarctica sea ice area has “modestly expanded” and warming has been “nearly non-existent” over much of the ice sheet. NASA estimates current Antarctica ice loss at 147 gigatons a year, but with 26,500,000 gigatons still to go, this works out at annual loss of 0.0005%. At current NASA ice loss melt, it will all be gone in about 200,000 years, although the Earth may well have gone through another ice age, or two, before then.
Most alarmist commentary centres around the cyclical loss of sea ice around the coast and some warming on parts of the west of the continent. But sea ice cover is running at levels seen around 50 years ago, as the graph below shows. Small rises and falls in the early 2010s have been followed by a reversion to the mean. 

The warmth to the west, seen in the first graph, could have been caused by any number of natural localised events including warmer oceanic waters and the effects of under-water volcanic activity. It has, of course, attracted widespread alarmist interest – in particular, the fate of the Thwaites ice stream, also known as the ‘Doomsday Glacier’. However, recently a group of oceanographers discovered that Florida-sized Thwaites had retreated at twice the rate in the past, when human-caused CO2 could not have been a factor. The retreat could have occurred centuries ago and is said to have been “exceptionally fast”.
Much of climate science today seems to suffer from confirmation bias. Few grants are available to those who don’t start with the premise that the climate is changing mostly, or entirely, due to humans burning fossil fuel. But many present, historic and paleo climate observations fail to establish a clear connection between temperatures and CO2 levels. In the past, the life-enhancing gas has occupied a space in the atmosphere up to 20 times higher, without evidence of huge temperature rises.
Singh and Polvani’s explanation for expected warming in Antarctica is the depth of the continent’s ice. To this end, they use two climate models that purport to show that the “high ice sheet orography” robustly decreases the climate sensitivity to extra CO2, and that “a flattened Antarctic ice sheet would experience significantly greater surface warming than the present-day Antarctica ice sheet”. This conclusion comes from computer models, but later in the paper is an admission that they fail to agree on significant matters. It is revealed that one of the models predicts less sea ice retreat in a flattened Antarctica when CO2 doubles, and the other one, more retreat.
In the science blog No Tricks Zone there has been an interesting debate on the lack of Antarctica warming. It was noted that NASA also tends to support the role of higher elevation of the ice as an explanation. For the rest of the world, states NASA, “the greenhouse effect still works as expected”. The average ice thickness in Antarctica is about 2,160 metres and compares with Greenland at around 1,600. The fact that Greenland has warmed of late might lead to the cynical observation that Antarctica has the wrong type of ice. One correspondent summarised the paper as the “lack of warming in spite of greenhouse gases is the wrong conclusion. The lack of warming is because of the increased greenhouse gases.” Another sighting, it would appear, of the old chestnut, “global cooling is caused by global warming”.
The science, as always, must be out. Attempting to connect every natural variation in weather and long-term climate to just one trace gas produced by humans leads to some unconvincing explanations, not least when climate models are involved."

Ambushed by enemy forces in Salman Pak, eastern Iraq, on March 20, 2005. With enemy fire peppering the convoy, the 23-year-old sergeant directed her gunner to send MK19 rounds downrange into a ditch containing more than a dozen heavily armed insurgents.

Hester then dismounted her vehicle, lobbing rounds from her M203 grenade launcher and tossing two fragmentation grenades into the trench line before storming the area on foot.

Joined by her squad leader, Sgt. Hester quickly cut through two additional trenches, personally killing three enemies to her front in close-quarters combat with her M4.

With the irrigation ditches cleared, a cease fire was called. Forty-five minutes of sheer pandemonium had transpired.

Twenty-seven insurgents lay dead, six wounded, and one captured.

Every member of Hester’s unit survived.

As a result, the Tiger King has been moved to a prison hospital for treatment after contracting the illness while incarcerated in Texas.

The 57-year-old is currently serving a 22-year sentence for animal abuse as well as attempting to take out a hitman on Carole Baskin.

Joe’s current husband, Dillon Passage, 24, had recently told a radio show that Joe had been moved to isolation after cases of COVID-19 had been reported at the prison he had recently been moved from.

Dillon said: “Since he’s been moved to this new facility, they are putting him on a COVID-19 isolation because of the previous jail he was at, there were cases.”

The Mirror says Joe’s diagnosis was confirmed on Texomashompage.com, which stated he has tested positive for COVID-19 and has been transferred to a hospital.

Tiger King is everywhere right now. You’re either talking about coronavirus, or shouting ‘Hey there cool cats and kittens!’ to your friends over the House Party app.

Although Tiger King puts Joe front and centre, the seven-part series introduced us to the likes of Vegas kingpin Jeff Lowe, eccentric park owner Doc Antle, Jurassic Park-inspired Rick Kirkman, walking Chucky doll James Garretson, and, of course, John Finlay.

The shirt-hating Floridian became famous for his not quite perfect teeth. He’s now had them sorted, and he looks unrecognisable.

Instagram

This comes after Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister reopened the case of Carole’s missing ex-husband, Jack Donald Lewis.

Whatever you think of Netflix’s Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness — we assume you’ve binged it all by now — there’s no denying Baskin is one of the series’ most divisive characters.

Netflix

The dramatic climax of Tiger King saw Joe behind bars after being convicted for his part in a murder for hire plot against Carole, however, the road to the final episode was a long one. One of the biggest twists came early on in the series with the revelation Carole’s first husband vanished under mysterious circumstances. Now, Florida authorities are re-opening the case of Jack Donald Lewis.

Posting on Twitter, Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister shared an appeal and said, “Since @Netflix and #Covid19 #Quarantine has made #TigerKing​ all the rage, I figured it was a good time to ask for new leads.” Chronister also posted a picture of Lewis and reminded everyone he hasn’t been seen since August 18, 1997.

Netflix

There’s no escaping the fact Joe thinks Carole killed her husband and fed him to the tigers — an allegation that grows alongside their feud with each other. It also led to the frankly brilliant Tiger King soundbite of, “Hey Carole, it’s a voice from your past… GET ME THE F**K OUT FROM UNDER THE SEPTIC TANK!”

The news comes after new claims from author Robert Moore. Moore is something of an expert on all things Baskin and Exotic and spent four years working on a podcast about the whole debacle. Writing on Twitter, Moore claimed he spoke to an ex of Carole’s and that Baskin once said the ominous line of: “Dead bodies can’t talk’.”

Even Gwyneth Paltrow has got in on the action and given her own views on what she thinks happened. One person tweeted, “Absolutely iconic how Carole Baskin did Tiger King thinking she’d get to expose Joe Exotic and Doc Antle for animal abuse and now all of America is obsessed with Joe and thinks Carole is a murderer. That’s showbiz baby.” Gwyneth simply wrote back: “THERE IS NO OTHER EXPLANATION.”

I’ll admit, my Tiger King journey was quite the rollercoaster and I went from feeling for Carole to rooting for Joe. While Exotic still languishes behind bars, we’ll have to see if anything comes from the Sheriff’s investigations. The big question is, does Carole know more than she’s letting on?

We stop immediately and the brain does not have blood circulation. Why are the ""three and a half minutes"" so important? In the middle of the night, when the desire to urinate wakes you up, the ecg pattern can change. By suddenly rising, the brain will be anemic and will cause heart failure for lack of blood. It is advisable to practice the three minutes and a half, which are:
1. When you wake up, stay in bed for a minute and a half.
2. Sit in the bed during the next half-minute;
3. Lower your legs and sit on the edge of the bed for half a minute. After three and a half minutes, your brain will no longer be anemic and your heart will not weaken, which will reduce the risk of falling and sudden death.

Once stopped, the drivers had everyone get off the buses, handed each of them a $100 bill and left. The passengers were illegal immigrants, straight from the southern border. Sheriffs Deputy’s on the scene said 12 of the illegals had to be immediately transported to the hospital because they had obvious signs of COVID-19.  Green Cove Springs has no hotels and no infrastructure to take care of more then a hundred illegal immigrants. By 12:30 pm it was 99 degrees outside. About half the illegals had wandered off but they have no place to really go. Those remaining were just sitting curb side.  It would be a 30 mile walk to Jacksonville or a 25 mile walk to St Augustine. What I find interesting is two things. One, Clay county is a strong Republican county and two, it has had low numbers of COVID case related to other counties in Florida. One spectator said “I’m feeling mixed emotions. I feel disgust for my government, sadness for these people who were just left side of the road, and fear for what these types of policies are doing to our country.”
 I agree with them. It is really sad what our government is putting these illegals and out citizens through.

1. Why did the Sheriff change her story? When talking to people on Facebook she said all of the people there were locals. Then she changed to say they were from all over Florida. What/who made her change her story? 
2. Even more importantly the Sheriff and Green Cove Springs Police Department  used the poster/flyer made up for the “event” and wrote in their posts that “The Mexican Consulate was in Green Cove Springs assisting local Mexicans in obtaining proper identification, documents”  Ask your self Why?

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_932674,"Audio from a radio show has emerged wherein Dr. Byram Bridle reveals the scientists behind the COVID-19 ""Vaccine"" made a terrible mistake.
According to the Doctor, who cites a brand new, peer-reviewed research study out of Japan ""They made a mistake - they thought the spike protein was a great target antigen, only to discover it is a toxin, that can travel to many organs of the body, causing severe damage.""

WORSE,  the spike proteins generated by mRNA vaccines don’t stay in the shoulder muscle, but spread to the brain, heart, ovaries, etc.
They also know that the spike protein is what causes the damage with COVID—and now it is clear how it is causing so much damage in other parts of the bodies of the vaccinated. 
From the video below Dr. Bridle on why the vax injuries are happening:
Spike protein, on its own is the cause of the vascular, neurodegenerative, problems, not the virus.
In the original theory it stay's in deltoid, goes to local draining lymph node, activates immune system.
But a new bio-distribution study from Japan tracked the vax and spike proteins.
It gets into the blood within days of vax, accumulates in spleen, brain, bone marrow, liver, adrenal glands, with high concentrations in ovaries.
Spike protein is a pathogenic toxin that causes damage if in circulation, binds to platelets, epithelial cells of blood vessels, clotting, bleeding, heart problems, brain blood clotting.

Conclusion is ""We made a big mistake, and didn't realize it till now."" ""We thought the spike protein was a great target antigen but never knew the spike protein itself was a pathogenic toxin protein."" ""By vaccinating people we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin.""
Give ear to this 8 Minute video.   If this Doctor is correct, and if the peer-reviewed report (HERE) is accurate, almost everyone who took the vaccine is going to be dead very soon because their own bodies are now manufacturing the very spike protein which is a Toxin that will kill them.

The spike proteins generated by both the mRNA vaccines don’t stay in the shoulder muscle, but spread to the brain, heart, ovaries, etc. They also know that the spike protein is what causes the damage with Covid—and now it is clear how it is causing so much damage in other parts of the bodies of the vaccinated.

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_614809,"A militant wearing the insignia of Mexico’s notorious Gulf Cartel (Cartel Del Golfo, CDG) has been filmed in the state of Tamaulipas carrying a US-made anti-tank missile launcher. News channel Milenio TV identified the weapon as a Javelin, thousands of which were sent to Ukraine by the Pentagon over the last year.

Footage filmed in Matamoros on Monday and aired on Tuesday evening by the news channel showed a man with CDG patches armed with a Kalashnikov rifle and a missile they said was the Raytheon-made FGM-148.

Over 10,000 Javelins from Pentagon stockpiles have been sent to Ukraine since last February, to the point where the US military has begun to run out of the missiles itself.

Milenio presenter Azucena Uresti noted on Twitter that the estimated value of a Javelin launcher on the black market was anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000, while the average cost of a missile was about $30,000.

Keen-eyed military experts believe the weapon in the Milenio footage may actually be the AT-4, a Swedish-made disposable anti-tank launcher, which is also in use by the US military and likewise supplied to Ukraine by the thousands. 

Russia has repeatedly warned the US and its allies not to “stuff” Ukraine with weapons and ammunition, both because this risked a direct confrontation and weapons ending up in the criminal underworld. 

An RT investigation in July 2022 found a variety of Western-supplied weapons, including anti-tank rockets, for sale on the “dark web.” Several months later, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned that $1 billion a month worth of Western weapons was ending up in the hands of “terrorists, extremists and criminal groups in the Middle East, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia.”

Kiev has denounced this as “propaganda” and insisted all shipments were accounted for.

The US outlet CBS censored a documentary on weapons supplies intended for Ukraine after the government in Kiev objected to its reporting. Last month, veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh said the West was aware its weapons were ending up on the black market, but that most governments did not care because arming Ukraine mattered more to them.

The Gulf Cartel is based in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, specifically in the border city of Matamoros, just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas. The militia dates back to the 1930s, but gained in notoriety in the late 1990s, when it spun off a notorious squad known as  Los Zetas.

The group has since broken off on its own. Though primarily known as a drug smuggling cartel, CDG has also been accused of racketeering, abductions, money laundering, and trafficking of people, sex slaves and weapons.

In March, the cartel apologized for one of its factions kidnapping four Americans and killing two of them, in what they said was a case of mistaken identity. Five members of that faction were handed over to the Mexican police."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_119468,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday recommended the first-ever monoclonal antibody marketed as a defense for all newborns against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.

Beyfortus, also known as nirsevimab, is produced by pharma giants Sanofi and AstraZeneca.

In a press release, the CDC referred to the drug as a “powerful tool” and a “new immunization.” According to the agency:

“ACIP [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] voted to include nirsevimab in the Vaccines for Children program, which provides recommended vaccines and immunizations at no cost to about half of the nation’s children.

“CDC is currently working to make nirsevimab available through the Vaccines for Children program. Healthcare providers will be a key partner in CDC’s outreach efforts. Additional clinical guidance and healthcare provider education material will be provided by CDC in the coming months.”

According to The Associated Press (AP), the drug will be offered as a “one-time shot for infants born just before or during the RSV season and for those less than 8 months old before the season starts,” and for some high-risk 8- to 19-month-old infants.

Infants in the high-risk group include “immunocompromised children and those with chronic lung disease — as well as Native American and Alaska Native children, who have RSV hospitalization rates between four and 10 times that of the general population,” STAT News reported.

CDC’s ACIP approved the recommendations in a unanimous 10-0 vote. Although not bound by ACIP’s vote, CDC Director Mandy Cohen signed off on the recommendations later on Thursday, according to CNBC.

Beyfortus will be “broadly available for all infants regardless of whether they have a health condition,” CNBC reported, adding that it will be “administered as a single dose.”

Some medical experts criticized the recommendation, pointing to infant deaths that occurred during the clinical trial for Beyfortus and questioning the need for their widespread administration to this age group.

Cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough told The Defender:

“While monoclonal antibodies are reasonably safe and effective, they are not clinically indicated nor medically necessary in all newborns.

“This new preventive strategy should be considered in rare cases with baseline lung disease such as severe asthma or cystic fibrosis. Injecting all newborns should be off the table and rejected by parents who want to avoid unnecessary drugs and potential harms.”

Brian Hooker, Ph.D., P.E., senior director of science and research for Children’s Health Defense (CHD), cited the significant number of infant deaths during Beyfortus’ clinical trial in his remarks:

“This is really too bad and seems to be a part of the Department of Health and Human Services’ scare tactics recently regarding RSV, which is generally a mild infection that finds its origin during the development of the polio vaccine.

“The efficacy of the antibodies from clinical trials is woefully low and the circulating half-life of such a therapeutic may be as low as two weeks.

“I’m also worried about allergic reactions in newborns, especially given the high dose of antibodies and especially given that 12 infants died in the experimental arm of the clinical trial.”

Dr. Meryl Nass, an internist, biological warfare epidemiologist and member of the CHD scientific advisory committee, cited a CDC study indicating RSV’s low risk for babies.

She also cited the lack of demonstrated long-term efficacy for such monoclonal antibodies, writing on her Substack:

“There is already resistance in RSV strains to this product, and so as it gets used, the resistant strains will outperform the susceptible ones, and the RSV ecology is likely to change … meaning its use will likely not last very long.”

ACIP recommended adding Beyfortus to the childhood vaccine schedule, which would provide manufacturers a waiver of liability, but also recommended coding it as a drug for insurance purposes and leaving it out of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP).

ACIP ignores ‘unrelated’ infant deaths during Beyfortus clinical trial

ACIP member and CDC epidemiologist Jefferson Jones, M.D., MPH, said during Thursday’s meeting, “The work group felt that RSV-associated disease in infants born, during, or entering their first RSV season is of public health importance.”

Also during Thursday’s meeting, clinical data regarding the effectiveness of Beyfortus was presented, indicating that it was “up to 75% effective at preventing lower respiratory tract infections that required medical attention among infants and 78% effective at preventing hospitalization,” CNBC reported.

However, Jones acknowledged that “a primary limitation” in the clinical trial was that “RSV testing may be more common for children with risk conditions inflating RSV-specific hospitalization rates.”

“Overall, the evidence rating was very low certainty, and this was downgraded because of indirectness, because of the use of pharmacokinetic data as a surrogate for efficacy,” he added. “The population did not include children that match the proposed indication outside of chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease … the study was small in size and … no placebo group was included for a comparison.”

Several infant deaths — 12 in all — were reported during the clinical trial, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) claimed during a June review were “unrelated” to the antibody. On Thursday, Jones repeated this claim during the ACIP meeting, stating that “no RSV-associated deaths were recorded.”

CNBC reported in June that of the 12 infants, “Four died from cardiac disease, two died from gastroenteritis, two died from unknown causes but were likely cases [of] sudden infant death syndrome, one died from a tumor, one died from COVID, one died from a skull fracture, and one died of pneumonia.”

And STAT News reported in June that no data are available “about whether giving nirsevimab to a baby whose mother was vaccinated against RSV during pregnancy would give the infant more protection or would be a waste of the product.”

During Thursday’s meeting, Jones said, “The most commonly reported adverse reaction were injection site reactions at 0.3% and rash at 0.9%.”

And, further justifying the committee’s subsequent unanimous vote, Jones cited data from an August 2022 University of Iowa and Rand Corporation study, stating that “70% of respondents said they definitely or probably would get an RSV antibody injection for their baby if safe and effective.”

However, Jones also stated that “only 33% of respondents thought their baby definitely or probably would get an RSV infection within one year after being born,” according to data from the same study.

Nevertheless, Jones said at Thursday’s meeting, “The work group determined that the target population probably feels that the desirable effects are large relative to undesirable effects.”

Jones did acknowledge, however, that “the work group felt that the desirable consequences probably outweigh the undesirable consequences in most settings with a minority opinion that desirable consequences clearly outweigh the undesirable consequences,” indicating at least a small amount of uncertainty among its members.

Beyfortus label ignores adverse events, ‘hardly worth the paper it is printed on’

Nass also took issue with ACIP members downplaying the potential risks of Beyfortus and noted that Beyfortus’ product label does not specify most potential adverse events associated with the drug.

“According to the label, the only risks specified are rashes and anaphylaxis. This is a very uninformative label. Hardly worth the paper it is printed on,” Nass wrote.

The label does not provide any details about side effects,” Nass added, noting that “It can be difficult to tell in a newborn. And the manufacturer and FDA appear to use that as a benefit, requiring less safety evaluation.”

“The label does not inform us of the causes of deaths,” Nass said, referring to the 12 infant deaths which occurred during the clinical trial for Beyfortus. “This is extremely worrisome.”

The label also states, in part, that “Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with Beyfortus” and that “No formal drug interaction studies have been performed” with the drug. There is also “limited experience with co-administration of Beyfortus with vaccines.”

Nass also noted that there are risks associated with the administration of monoclonal antibodies more broadly, citing the Cleveland Clinic, which states that “Infusion reactions are common, and occur during or shortly after monoclonal antibody treatment.”

There are also “more serious but less common risks linked to unwanted immune system reactions, such as acute anaphylaxis, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and serum sickness.”

“Some monoclonal antibodies have been associated with allergic reactions and skin rashes,” CNBC reported.

Nass rhetorically questioned whether any monoclonal antibody has ever been administered on a wide scale to children and if any such drugs have ever been approved for newborns, writing that the answer is “no” in each instance.

Perhaps partially acknowledging such concerns, STAT News reported that “experts cautioned that rolling the drug out across the country would be difficult. The U.S. has never before tried to give this type of medicine to nearly every infant.”

STAT News quoted ACIP member Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, a Vanderbilt University infectious disease specialist, who said Beyfortus “is life-changing” and that she’s “very excited” about it, but that she “just hope[s] we can get through the hurdles.”

CDC ‘playing fast and loose with the definition of vaccine’

Experts are also raising questions about the CDC’s treatment of Beyfortus as a vaccine in some instances and as a drug in other cases.

According to the AP, “the expert panel also supported including it in Vaccines for Children (VFC), a government program providing free immunizations. The American Academy of Pediatrics is urging hospitals to stock Beyfortus so that newborns can get it during RSV season before they go home.”

STAT News reported that Vaccines for Children is a “30-year-old program that assures children of parents without health insurance can be vaccinated for free.”

According to CNBC, “Beyfortus works like a vaccine, but the shot is considered a drug, not a vaccine, because it is an antibody injection. Vaccines prepare the body’s immune system to release antibodies that fight viruses, while Beyfortus injects these antibodies directly into the bloodstream.”

Nass took issue with this juggling of classifications, writing on her Substack:

“CDC is playing fast and loose with the definition of vaccine again, calling it a vaccine when convenient and a drug when that is more convenient. In order to get it onto the childhood vaccine schedule it becomes a vaccine — giving the manufacturer a waiver of liability. But it must be coded for reimbursement as a drug.

“It will be covered by the Affordable Care Act insurance program as a vaccine. But if there is an adverse event when it is used alone, the adverse event report will be filed in the (FAERS) [FDA Adverse Event Reporting System] belonging to FDA. If it is administered along with vaccines, the adverse event report will be sent to VAERS [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System], belonging jointly to FDA and CDC.”

In justifying Beyfortus’ mixed classification as either a vaccine or drug, Dr. Georgina Peacock, director of the Immunization Services Division at the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at Thursday’s meeting:

“When we look at the Vaccines for Children program there is no statutory definition of vaccine in the statute when we look at the Affordable Care Act. Similarly, there is no statutory definition of vaccine in the Affordable Care Act.

“So, CDC has determined that [Beyfortus] is eligible for inclusion in the childhood immunization schedule and the Vaccines for Children program.”

She added that “this product … does look similar to other routine vaccines. It’s administered intramuscularly with a single-dose prefilled syringe. It can be administered simultaneously with other childhood vaccines … the storage and handling is similar to other routine vaccines.”

George Reed Grimes, M.D., MPH, director of the Division of Injury Compensation Programs at the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Health Systems Bureau, said “the Vaccine for Children Program and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program are separate. So just inclusion in the VFC would not trigger inclusion in the NVICP or vice versa.”

The NVICP covers injuries related to vaccines that are routinely administered to children and pregnant women.

Is widespread administration of an RSV monoclonal antibody to infants needed?

According to the AP, “In the U.S., about 58,000 children younger than 5 are hospitalized for RSV each year and several hundred die,” while according to CNBC, “RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization among infants in the U.S.”

CNBC previously reported that the U.S. “suffered an unusually severe RSV season” last winter. The New York Times reported on a “tripledemic” involving RSV, flu and COVID-19, “that swamped children’s hospitals and some I.C.U. wards.”

According to the CDC, nearly all children are infected with RSV before the age of 2.

However, according to Nass, the risk of death from RSV is lower than the risk of injury or death by vaccines and other treatments being pushed for the illness.

In May, Nass wrote that the CDC published a paper on RSV deaths in infants between 2009 and 2021, which found “were only a total of 300 deaths in children less than one year over the 12 years, or 25 on average per year.”

Nass added at the time that the number of injuries that may be caused by vaccines or other treatments during pregnancy “is almost certainly going to outweigh the loss of 25 babies a year from RSV.”

Citing CDC figures, Nass wrote on her Substack yesterday that “4 million babies are born yearly in the U.S. 20,000 die in their first year. RSV kills 0.125% of them. It is way down the list of top causes of death.” She added:

“RSV almost never causes chronic problems, except perhaps asthma. Or maybe children with an asthma tendency are also more susceptible to severe RSV.

“RSV does hospitalize a lot of U.S. infants. It frightens parents and causes a lot of work for doctors. And so, this group of pediatricians on CDC’s advisory committee went gaga over this new product, which is supposed to be 70-80% effective at preventing severe RSV disease.”

More RSV drugs in the pipeline

According to the AP, Beyfortus “is expected to be ready in the fall before the RSV season, typically November through March.” Its expected cost is $495 per dose, which will be “covered by insurance,” although “[ACIP] Panelists acknowledged that it will be a challenge at first to give the shot and for providers to be reimbursed by insurers.”

CNBC reported that “It could potentially take months for some insurance plans to update their policies to comply with the requirement.”

For high-risk children in the 8- to 19-month group, “the drug will cost twice as much,” STAT News reported, because they will receive a second injection.

According to Endpoints News, Beyfortus has already received regulatory approval in the European Union, United Kingdom and Canada, but “it has not yet launched in any of those markets.”

The approval of Beyfortus comes as a range of RSV vaccines have recently been approved or are in the pipeline for approval.

In May, the FDA approved Pfizer’s Abrysvo for administration to pregnant women, despite concerns raised by some medical experts about premature births identified during clinical trials. FDA approval is expected later this month, according to the AP.

And also in May, the FDA approved Arexvy, an RSV vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK), and Pfizer’s Abrysvo, for people ages 60 and older. In June, the ACIP recommended the two vaccines, and later that month, outgoing CDC Director Rochelle Walensky approved the recommendation.

Abrysvo has been linked to Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks its own nerves. Symptoms can range from brief weakness to paralysis.

Another monoclonal antibody for the treatment of RSV, palivizumab, is available on the market, but according to CNBC, it “is primarily used for pre-term babies and those with congenital heart and lung conditions” and “is also more difficult to administer because infants have to receive a shot monthly during RSV season.”

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_250597,"Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, who died last Saturday at 95, and the Vatican requested that President Joe Biden not attend Benedict's funeral, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday.
Benedict made the request prior to his death.
The U.S. will send Joe Donnelly, ambassador of the Holy See, ""in line with the wishes of the late Pope and the Vatican. This is what their requests were. This is what their wishes were,"" Jean-Pierre said when asked if Biden would attend the funeral, which is being held Thursday in St. Peter's Square.

""Well why do you think? You tell me,"" the president responded on the South Lawn when asked why the White House was sending an ambassador to the memorial and not him. ""The reason why I'm not attending the funeral tomorrow is because it takes an entourage of 1,000 people, not literally, but we would move everything in the wrong direction,"" Biden then answered. 
Biden, who has taken flak from Catholics for supporting abortions, in a statement released over the weekend said he will always remember the Pope’s generosity and the meaningful conversations they had at the Vatican in 2011.
""He will be remembered as a renowned theologian, with a lifetime of devotion to the church, guided by his principles and faith,"" Biden said. ""As he remarked during his 2008 visit to the White House, 'The need for global solidarity is as urgent as ever, if all people are to live in a way worthy of their dignity.' May his focus on the ministry of charity continue to be an inspiration to us all.""
The funeral is drawing heads of state and royalty despite Benedict's request for simplicity and Vatican efforts to keep the first Vatican funeral low-key for an emeritus Pope in modern times.

Only Italy and Germany were invited to send official delegations, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Italian President Sergio Mattarella confirmed their participation.
But other heads of state and government decided to take the Vatican up on its offer and come in their ""private capacity."" As of a late count Wednesday, seven heads of state, four prime ministers, and two delegations of royal representatives were attending as private citizens, including the president of Togo, the prime minister of Gabon and royals from Belgium and Spain."

And did exercises
And made art and played
And learned new ways of being
And stopped and listened more deeply
Someone meditated, someone prayed
Someone met their shadow
And people began to think differently
And people healed
And in the absence of people who
Lived in ignorant ways
Dangerous, meaningless and heartless,
The earth also began to heal
And when the danger ended and
People found themselves
They grieved for the dead
And made new choices
And dreamed of new visions
And created new ways of living
And completely healed the earth
Just as they were healed.

The spread of the deadly disease could be far worse than officials claim, with 480,000 Americans expected to die from the virus and 4.8 million hospitalized, according to a presentation hosted by The American Hospital Association (AHA) in February.

This puts the crisis on a level more than 10 times greater than that seen in a severe flu season.

The shock figures fly in the face of claims made by President Trump who has maintained on many occasions that the risk to Americans is 'low'. 

Dr. James Lawler, a professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, presented the harrowing 'best guess' estimates of the extent of the outbreak to hospitals and health professionals as part of the AHA webinar called 'What healthcare leaders need to know: Preparing for the COVID-19' on February 26. 

The slides, obtained by Business Insider, suggest that hospitals need to ramp up preparations now to reduce the death toll around the US. 

US hospitals should be preparing for 96 million coronavirus infections and nearly half a million deaths from the outbreak, a doctor's 'best guess' prediction suggest. People are pictured wearing face masks in Times Square, New York on March 3

At the time of the presentation last week, there were more than 80,000 confirmed cases around the globe.

At the time, the US had around 60 cases and no deaths. Fast forward just one week, and the US has more than 430 cases and 19 confirmed deaths.  

Worldwide, more than 100,000 people have now been infected. 

The slides also reveal the significant risks to older people and those with pre-existing health conditions if they catch coronavirus.  

People aged 80 and over have a 14.8% chance of dying if they contract the infection, the slides revealed.

The spread of the deadly disease could be far worse than officials claim, with 480,000 Americans expected to die from the virus and 4.8 million hospitalized, according to estimates from University of Nebraska professor Dr. James Lawler. People are pictured buying hand sanitizer in Washington DC Friday

These figures put the crisis on a level 10 times greater than that seen in a severe flu season. The shock figures fly in the face of claims made by President Trump who has maintained on many occasions that the risk to Americans is 'low'

The risk declines with youth, though those aged 70-79 and 60-69 are still placed at a significant risk, with 8% and 3.6% mortality rates respectively.

Lawler also estimated that people with heart conditions have a one in 10 chance of dying from the disease, compared to the less than one in a 100 chance among healthy individuals with no pre-existing medical conditions.  

A spokesman for Nebraska Medicine told Business Insider that the figures represent the views of Lawler and 'his interpretation of the data available'

'It's possible that forecast will change as more information becomes available,' they said.

The AHA added that the views were the speaker's and not its own.

President Trump, who has faced criticism for downplaying the risk of the disease, signed a spending bill to allocate $8.3 billion to tackle the crisis Friday 

The president holds a photograph of coronavirus at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta Friday. The new funding measure provides money for public health agencies for tests, vaccines and other treatments

However, Lawler isn't the first to warn that the disease could spread farther than first thought. 

Harvard University Professor Marc Lipsitch previously told The Atlantic that up to 70% of the global population will be infected with coronavirus within the next year. 

Lawler did not give a particular timeframe for the outbreak but his estimates ramp up fears that the disease could push US hospitals to their limits.   

President Trump, who has faced criticism for downplaying the risk of the disease, signed a spending bill to allocate $8.3 billion to tackle the crisis. 

The president only asked Congress for just above $2 billion but they rejected that and both houses passed an $8.3 billion spending bill Friday.

While the figure more than triples the amount outlined by the White House last month, Democrat rivals have slammed Trump saying it's too little, too late.

The new funding measure provides money for public health agencies for tests, vaccines and other treatments. 

It will also provide money to state and local governments to respond to the epidemic.

Medics bring out a patient on a gurney at the Life Care Center of Kirkland, a long-term care facility linked to several confirmed coronavirus cases and at least nine deaths

The US death toll from coronavirus rose to 17 Friday, after three new deaths were recorded in Washington state and Florida recorded its first two

The House passed the legislation Wednesday and the Senate did so on Thursday, as part of a rapid response to increased public fears about the disease, which has disrupted schools, airlines, and spring break plans. 

A group of lawmakers from both parties negotiated the increased figure and other provisions in the measure in a rare sign of bipartisanship.

The president also said 'anyone who wants a test can get a test', throwing widespread confusion into the air given widespread shortages of tests.

The US death toll from coronavirus rose to 17 Friday, after three new deaths were recorded in Washington state and Florida recorded its first two. 

The Florida Department of Health confirmed the latest deaths Friday night.  

One of the fatalities was a man in his 70s who had been sick in Santa Rosa County in the Panhandle, and the other was a man in his 70s in Lee County on the Gulf Coast. Both men had reportedly traveled internationally."

Politifact_FALSE_News and blog_201417,"Women have condemned a charity after it suggested the vagina could instead be referred to as 'the bonus hole' to avoid upsetting non-binary or trans men.

Female rights campaigners today rounded on the alternative glossary, branding it both 'misogynistic' and 'utterly dehumanising'.

It is featured on charitable organisation Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust on a page for health professionals who are treating patients who have the disease.

Today the trust insisted it was not suggesting the term should be used by all women - but added it was important to reach trans men and non-binary people.

But the 'bonus hole' term - which the cause says was developed with expert organisations who work with the LGBT community - was widely condemned.

The page also features a suggestion that the vagina might also be referred to as a 'front hole'

The charity at the centre of the controversy said it was doing everything to try and encourage everyone to attend screenings

The term is featured on page on cancer charity Jo's Trust website and is for health professionals

It is entitled 'Language to use when supporting trans men and/or non-binary people'. 

Conservatives for Women founder Caroline Ffiske told MailOnline: 'The gender movement seems actively to want to encourage body disassociation and hatred, in other words to actively create more confused young people alienated from their own physicality and their own sex.

'What better way than to use this utterly dehumanising language about our own bodies?

'To my mind it is grooming: create the unease, the disassociation, the alienation, and then when you have done that, you step in with euphoric rhetoric about 'trans joy'.

'Fill the void you have created. Of course those doing this will not be around to pick up the pieces when young bodies are irreversibly damaged and young lives destroyed. Is there a mechanism whereby these charities promoting harm could be struck off?'

The glossary says it was created with the help of the LGBT Foundation.

Its adds that using the wrong terms if a person does not use them can lead to them feeling hurt or distressed.

Kellie-Jay Keen, the founder of Standing for Women, described parts of the glossary as 'an erasure of female language'.

She added: 'The whole thing is loathsome but bonus hole and front hole are so misogynist.

Caroline Ffiske, left, who founded Conservatives for Women, said the term was 'dehumanising;

Women's rights campaigner Kellie-Jay Keen said 'bonus hole' was a 'misogynistic loathsome term'

'If a woman is so triggered by the word vagina I should imagine she need serious psychiatric help rather than the world bend to her never ending list of irrational demands.

'You would think that charities focused on cervical cancer would have better things to do than erase female language. Still it's better than the Canadian cervical charity who devoted a whole section for men with cervical cancer.'

The trust moved today to head off the controversy and explain why it had published the guide.

It said it included it to try and help health professionals and reach potential cancer sufferers that may be concerned about attending screenings.

A spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We are aware that some of our online information is currently attracting significant attention. The information being shared is from a webpage written for health professionals to support trans men and / or non-binary patients with a cervix to attend cervical screening.

'The page includes a glossary of terms they may hear from their patients and was developed with expert organisations who work with the LGBT community.

'The page is not promoting the use of these phrases with all women, it is a list of phrases that nurses may hear some patients prefer.

'Our mission at Jo's is to prevent as many cervical cancers as possible, and a big part of that is increasing uptake of cervical screening.

'Women are our main audience at Jo's, however some trans men and / or non-binary people have cervixes and to reduce as many cervical cancers as possible it is important that we also provide information for this group and the health professionals who support them.'"

By Doris Days

In a move some would call ""stunningly ironic"", Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) has had the firearms of her guards and household seized. This comes only days after pushing her party's ""red flag"" law through the Senate.
Former campaign staffer, James Halligan, is behind the move, telling law enforcement that she is a threat to all her staffers, household, and even guards. Halligan had previously accused the Governor of sexual assault and harassment.
Citing this new ""Extreme Risk Firearm Protection Order"", it was determined that Grisham was indeed a danger to those around her. Since her guards always carry weapons in her presence, and she has close, intimate contact with them, officers ordered them disarmed until further notice.
""That red flag law is idiotic"" says one of La Plata county's finest. ""It's been nothing short of a disaster for us and puts all LEO's at risk!""
Colorado also suffers from a similar red flag law.
We asked the governor about this move that effectively ""emasculates"" her ""This is stupid. I'm not a danger to anyone! As long as they do what I tell them, we'll get along fine! Besides, when I pushed for this law, I never thought it would apply to me!""

Politifact_Mostly False_Press release_41803,"Madison... Assembly Republican veterans are speaking out against a proposal in Governor Tony Evers’ budget that would reduce tuition for non U.S. citizens. Under the Evers proposal, college applicants in the country illegally would pay substantially reduced in-state tuition if they’ve attended a Wisconsin high school and been “present” in the state for three years. In contrast, veterans in the state must prove not only residency of five years, but prove military service and maintain their grades in order to receive tuition benefits.
“This is a stunning display of the displaced priorities Governor Evers used to develop his budget,” said Rep. Ken Skowronski (R-Franklin). “Veterans who have served our nation are forced to meet a much higher standard to get the tuition remission they earned through sacrifice than the governor asks from illegal immigrants.”
The Republican representatives are asking the members of the Joint Committee on Finance to remove the item from the budget. The tuition break for each illegal immigrant could run tens of thousands of dollars, much more than what veterans receive in the tuition remission program.
“Governor Evers’s proposal shows how out of touch he is with Wisconsin’s veterans,” said Rep. Jim Ott (R-Mequon). “Of course, it should be taken out of the budget.”
“Governor Evers has misplaced priorities if he thinks it’s acceptable that undocumented immigrants should have an easier path to in-state tuition than our veterans,” said Rep. Jesse James (R-Altoona). “It’s frankly quite disgusting and a disservice to those that have served and defended this country’s freedoms, freedoms that make it possible for the Wisconsin Idea to exist. I urge the Joint Finance Committee to remove this from the budget.”
Under state statute, the Wisconsin veteran remission program requires veterans to prove Wisconsin residency at time of entry into service or for five consecutive years as well as proving qualifying service and maintaining a C average. Some veterans who serve Wisconsin still would not meet the residency standard and would be ineligible for the tuition program.
“The Evers plan says three years for illegal immigrants to get special tuition benefits, but five years for veterans,” said Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc). “We are talking about people who fought for our freedom and deserve our respect and gratitude.”"

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_601740,"Cory’s plan is the most sweeping gun violence prevention proposal ever advanced by a presidential candidate.
To make justice a reality for all, we have to end the epidemic of gun violence and invest in communities that have been shattered by the trauma left in its wake. To do that, we need to adopt a plan that introduces aggressive gun safety measures — the most forward-leaning this country has ever seen.
Cory’s plan would:
Keep guns out of the wrong hands
Hold gun manufacturers accountable
Bring the fight to the NRA
This is a personal fight for Cory. His perspective is rooted in his experience living in Newark, NJ, and working to stem the tide of violence for the past 20 years — as a tenant organizer, on the city council, as mayor, and as a senator. Last month, Cory kicked off his campaign for president with a call to bring people together to make justice for all real. He highlighted gun violence prevention specifically in his call to action:
We won’t wait for more thoughts and prayers for communities that have been shattered by gun violence — from Pittsburgh to Parkland to Charleston to communities where kids fear the fireworks of Fourth of July because to them they sound like gunshots.
We will pass universal background checks. We will ban assault weapons and close the loopholes that allow people who should never have a gun to get one. We will bring a fight to the NRA like they have never ever seen before. And we will win.
That’s why today, Cory is unveiling the most sweeping gun violence prevention proposal ever advanced by a presidential candidate, which at its core has a simple but effective idea: Licenses for guns.
WHAT’S IN THE PLAN?
Beginning on Day One in office, Cory would take action to close dangerous loopholes in gun sales, crack down on gun manufacturers, and invest in communities impacted by gun violence.
Here’s how he would do it:
Keep guns out of the wrong hands with gun licensing:
Just as a driver’s license demonstrates a person’s eligibility and proficiency to drive a car, a gun license demonstrates that a person is eligible and can meet certain basic safety and training standards necessary to own a gun.
Here’s how it would work: Individuals could seek a gun license at a designated local office, widely available in urban and rural areas, similar to applying for or renewing a passport. They would submit fingerprints, provide basic background information, and demonstrate completion of a certified gun safety course.
The FBI would then verify submission of required materials and run a comprehensive background check before issuing a federal gun license, after which the license-holder could freely purchase and own firearms. The license would be valid for up to five years before renewal with regular, automatic checks to flag non-compliance with license terms.
Recognizing that many states have already implemented state licensure programs, states could continue to do so, provided that they meet baseline federal standards.
Bring real regulation and oversight to gun manufacturers:
Nowadays, there is more regulation over toy guns than real ones. While medicine, children’s toys, and any number of other consumer products are subject to regulation by the federal government, firearms are exempt.
In other words, gun manufacturers have little incentive to make their products safer. Cory will work to close this loophole in federal oversight and allow the Consumer Product Safety Commission to ensure gun safety by making safety warnings and issuing recalls for faulty firearms.
End legal immunity that prevents victims of gun violence from seeking justice:
While civil liability can be applied to sellers and manufacturers of nearly every product, as a result of a 2005 law the gun industry is immune from nearly all lawsuits. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) allows the gun industry to ignore public safety implications of the misuse of their products, such as gun trafficking.
Cory will fight to end gun industry immunity by repealing PLCAA and allow victims of gun violence to have their day in court when a gun dealer or manufacturer has acted negligently.
Require handgun microstamping:
Microstamping is technology that allows law enforcement to identify the source of ammunition used in crimes by making a shell casing traceable to the specific gun that fired the round. Unfortunately, in many cases, there is little evidence left behind at crime scenes, resulting in a homicide “clearance rate” of just 62 percent. Microstamping technology would allow law enforcement to trace crime guns as soon as a shell casing is found, helping to prevent future crimes from occurring.
Cory will fight to require that microstamping technology be incorporated into new models of semi-automatic handguns sold in the United States.
Close the “Boyfriend Loophole”:
While current law forbids an abusive spouse or ex-spouse convicted of abuse or under a restraining order from purchasing a firearm, the same commonsense rule does not extend to non-felony abuse at the hands of dating partners or former dating partners.
The risk of homicide in a domestic violence incident increases by 500 percent with the presence of a gun. Cory will make closing the “Boyfriend Loophole” a top priority.
Ensure a background check on every gun sale by closing the loophole on guns show and online sales and the so-called “Charleston Loophole”:
Background checks are foundational to any gun safety policy, but loopholes in current law allow individuals to purchase guns in private sales from strangers without a background check. Current law requires that federally licensed firearms dealers conduct background checks on individuals seeking to purchase a firearm in commercial transactions, but prohibited purchasers — such as criminals and domestic abusers — can exploit this loophole simply by finding an unlicensed seller.
More than 90 percent of American voters — and nearly 70 percent of NRA members — support universal background checks.
Ban assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, and bump stocks:
Large capacity ammunition magazines and assault weapons have been present in many mass shootings in the US, made for no other purpose than to kill people quickly and efficiently.
Provide dedicated funding for research on gun violence as a public health issue:
For the first time in modern history, the CDC announced that deaths from gun violence surpassed automobile accidents. Automobiles have become safer, in part, as a result of federal investment in research, but Congress has not provided federal funds to research gun safety.
After nearly two decades of shameful inaction, Cory will make a significant investment into research on gun violence, including into evidence-based approaches to reducing gun suicide.
Modernize and strengthen the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF):
As a result of relentless lobbying by the gun lobby, the ATF is drastically underfunded and has its hands tied. According to reporting by the New York Times, in the year beginning in October 2016, while more than half of inspections of licensed firearm dealers were cited for violations, less than one percent led to the loss of a license.
Cory will increase funding at ATF and would repeal the restrictive riders on ATF’s budget that restrict law enforcement’s ability to investigate crimes and crack down on gun dealers.
Support extreme risk prevention order laws:
An extreme risk protection order (ERPO) empowers family members or law enforcement to petition a court to temporarily remove firearms from individuals showing warning signs of hurting themselves or others. Cory will incentivize states to pass ERPO laws, along with robust due process protections.
Limit gun buyers to one handgun per month:
Limiting bulk purchases of firearms is essential to combating gun trafficking. Under current federal law, which contains no limit on the number of firearms one can purchase, traffickers will make bulk purchases in states with weak gun laws and then resell in states with stricter rules.
Require firearm owners to report lost or stolen firearms:
Researchers estimate that the majority of lost or stolen firearms are never reported, which limits the ability of law enforcement to trace the source of guns used in crimes. When law enforcement is able to trace a crime gun to the purchaser of record, he/she will often claim that it was lost or stolen to deny responsibility.
Cory will take the commonsense step to require gun owners to report their lost and stolen firearms, building on evidence that shows a correlation between the enactment of state reporting laws and major reductions in illegal gun trafficking.
Ramp up funding for community-based violence intervention programs:
Cory will direct new federal funding to support evidence-based programs similar to those he supported as mayor of Newark. According to a recent report by the Giffords Law Center, adopting a strategy of relationship-driven social services and more narrowly-targeted law enforcement interventions allowed Oakland, CA to cut annual shootings and homicides in half.
Additionally, Cory will provide grant funding to local law enforcement to combat gun violence to adopt new technology, including acoustic gunshot detection systems.
Increase trauma support for survivors and communities impacted by gun violence:
Cory would fight for resources and support for families and communities impacted by the scourge of gun violence.
Call on the IRS to conduct an investigation into the NRA’s tax status:
Currently, the NRA is exempt from federal tax under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. Cory is calling on the IRS to investigate whether certain activities recently reported in the news media should lead to revocation of its tax-exempt status.
Finally, beginning on Day One in office, Cory will take executive action to build on ongoing efforts and take concrete steps forward — closing dangerous loopholes in gun sales, cracking down on unscrupulous dealers and gun manufacturers, and investing in communities impacted by gun violence.

Politifact_Mostly False_Press release_888712,"Meets with Border Trade Alliance, Rio Grande Valley Partnership, highlights crisis at Texas-Mexico border on Ben Shapiro Show
HOUSTON, Texas - U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) this week held meetings in his Washington, D.C. Senate office with members of the Border Trade Alliance and the Rio Grande Valley Partnership. In those meetings, Sen. Cruz participated in a dialogue with the members, and discussed his views regarding trade and immigration, among other issues facing the Texas-Mexico border.

During his meeting with the Border Trade Alliance, Sen. Cruz highlighted the over 144,000 apprehensions on the Texas-Mexico border, which continue to overwhelm infrastructure and border communities.

""The Texas border is a wonderful place,"" Sen. Cruz said to the Border Trade Alliance. ""Unfortunately right now, the border is a flashpoint for enormous political disagreement. On border security, what we are seeing is a crisis. As you know, we apprehended over 144,000 people in a single month. That is a pace, which if it continues for 12 months, would put us on a pace for nearly two million apprehensions on the border. That exceeds what we can handle. And I've heard from a number of you in this room about how the volume of illegal crossings is now overwhelming infrastructure, overwhelming the ability of the communities to absorb that much population coming in.""

In his meeting with the Rio Grande Valley Partnership, Sen. Cruz reiterated his commitment to devoting the resources necessary for securing the border.

""I have heard from leaders in the Valley, I have heard from leaders up and down the border that it is swamping the capacity of the communities to deal with that volume of people coming,"" Sen. Cruz said to the Rio Grande Valley Partnership. ""That is exceeds the infrastructure capacity. And I can tell you on my end that I am pressing hard for us to devote the resources necessary to deal with the incredible influx of people coming illegally, but also to close the loopholes that Congress has put in place.""

Sen. Cruz also addressed the issue of trade with the groups, noting that the border is a ""thriving example"" of international trade.

""The single most frequent concern I hear from Texas business leaders is trade,"" Sen. Cruz said to the Border Trade Alliance. ""I know there is a lot of anxiety in this room over trade and I understand that; you are not crazy to be anxious about it. Within the Trump administration, there are divided voices. Some voices within the administration want to tear down the barriers of our trading partners, to letting our goods and services into their markets and want to increase international trade. Other voices in the administration want to erect barriers into our own markets and want to decrease international trade. Between those two, I am emphatically in the camp of the former and not the latter. I believe in international trade. Texas does well, Texas farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and small businesses, we do well if our markets are open and the border is a thriving example of that. I have had the great pleasure of touring factories and plants and businesses all up and down the border and it is incredible, the opportunity that we are seeing, flourishing on the border through doing trade with Mexico and more broadly with the world.""

When asked about the ongoing crisis at the border on the Ben Shapiro Show, Sen. Cruz urged his colleagues in Congress to provide the resources necessary to secure the border and build the wall. Listen to the full interview here.

""We are seeing an absolute crisis on the border,"" Sen. Cruz said. ""My home state of Texas, of the 2,000 miles of border the United States has with Mexico, 1,200 of those miles are in Texas. And we are seeing the crisis, you know when I'm down at the border, I spend a lot of time at the border, when I'm down at the border and the Rio Grande Valley, or all along the border, local officials there say they are being overwhelmed, and these are elected Democrats on the border but they are saying the volume of illegal immigration is so overwhelming right now.

""The position of congressional Democrats is essentially they are telling everyone ‘go jump in a lake,'"" Sen. Cruz continued. ""The president, the administration has asked for a supplemental funding bill of $4.5 billion to provide the resources to deal with this crisis at the border and to date, congressional Democrats have said ‘hell no,' they are not willing to do anything. I hope that they change. That is really a heartless position, and my understanding is next week, the Senate is going to vote on this, so we will see where Senate Democrats line up. But right now, they are telling those children who are coming across the border that they are not willing to provide any resources that those kids, those families need -- that we need to secure the border and stop this crisis."""

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_663099,"Should Vermont taxpayer-funded government lawyers do free legal work for private law firms and companies? Or should the state be reimbursed for that work? Those are some of the questions that need to be asked after the recent Vermont Supreme Court decision, Doyle v. City of Burlington Police Department. 

The Vermont Attorney General’s Office is the State of Vermont’s lawyer. We receive a public records request roughly every three days. And to be as transparent as possible we post those requests, related correspondence, and our responses to our website. Most of the requests for records possessed by the Attorney General’s Office are from private law firms and companies. Everyone has the right to request public records. This is good for government transparency and for democracy. 

As Vermont’s lawyer, we believe our clients, including offices of the state, have a right to be represented. This means every document requested is scrutinized, reviewed, and vetted by lawyers to make sure we are not revealing confidential or privileged information, making sure we are complying with court orders and the Public Records Act and other statutes, and not jeopardizing investigations or our clients’ rights. This is a lawyer’s ethical duty. This is legal work. This takes time – taxpayer-funded time. This is the very “staff time” that the court said was reimbursable. This is not about simply snapping a photo. Or possibly allowing outside lawyers and companies to bring portable scanners into the Attorney General’s Office to copy documents for free. 

This is also time that my team could be spending on protecting consumers, addressing the opioid epidemic, advocating for civil rights, and ensuring that we have access to clean water and clean air. There is a cost to Vermonters associated with diverting attorney time and resources from my office’s mission. More to the point, should we provide free legal work to law firms and companies that may take an adverse position to the policies of our state? They may be collecting documents in anticipation of litigation against the state. I believe that’s their right, but I also believe we should be reimbursed for our costs. It takes a minute to make a request, but it may take hours to comply with that request. 

The Public Records Act provides transparency and openness about documents and other records held by government. Anyone can request to copy or inspect a record. To inspect is free. The law does allow the government to be reimbursed (after 30 minutes) for the cost of gathering, preparing, analyzing, and redacting the document in anticipation of copying. For my office, the primary cost is not for the photocopy — it is for the staff time needed to locate the record, perform the analysis, and redact things like student names, personal information, information protected by the attorney client privilege, or confidential information. 

The Doyle decision did not resolve all the questions about our Public Records Act, but it attempted to clarify when the state could be reimbursed. The court divided public records requests into two columns: inspection and copying. According to the court, these columns do not intersect. A requester who wishes to make copies is in the copying column and is subject to a request of reimbursement from the government. To “copy,” the court stated, is to take something that the requestor could “keep and review whenever or wherever” they choose. 

Gov. Phil Scott and Secretary of State Jim Condos have interpreted that to mean government can’t charge a requester who takes a photo with their phone of those records or someone who uses a portable scanner, because there is no cost to the state. What they fail to acknowledge is the enormous cost to Vermont taxpayers in preparing those documents — documents that may be potentially used in litigation against the state. Again, that’s the requestor’s right and I believe they are entitled to the documents. I just think the state, and the taxpayer, should be reimbursed for that work — exactly what’s allowed under the Doyle decision. 

This is about advocating for a system that promotes transparency while balancing access to records with legitimate legal protections afforded to our clients and members of the public while protecting the Vermont taxpayer.


My hope is that the Legislature will take up this issue during the next legislative session. These are policy questions that need to be resolved and until they are, I will continue to promote transparency, advocate for the rule of law, and protect the Vermont taxpayer"

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_997781,"Order Todd’s new book – “Culture Jihad: How to Stop the Left From Killing a Nation.” It’s an explosive look at the attack on American traditionalism.

The sex and gender revolutionaries have officially taken over the Austin Independent School District without firing a single shot.

In spite of overwhelming opposition from parents and pastors, the district’s trustees voted early Tuesday morning to implement a pornographic sex education policy that includes instruction on anal sex and how to place a condom on an erect penis.

The father of a fifth grader demanded to know who gave the school district the right to teach his child how to have anal and oral sex.

“Who gave you the right, Austin ISD? You have overstepped,” the rightfully frustrated dad said.

The radical sex education policy will provide graphic instruction on gender identity and mandated support of the LGBT movement.

Students in grade school and middle school will also be taught how to get an abortion or obtain birth control pills without parental permission or consent.

The school district will also begin instructing students to no longer use words like “mother” or “father.”

“Use gender inclusive language,” the district’s material mandates. “It is important to avoid terms which refer to only ‘male’ or ‘female’ identities when speaking with young children as this can limit their understanding of gender into binaries and can exclude children who may not identify within these identities.”

The district’s curriculum recommends “integrating” words like parents or guardians instead mom or dad.

Texas Values, one of the state’s leading family advocacy groups, warned that the Austin ISD was sending a message that people of faith are no longer welcome in the school district.

“Austin ISD has broken the sacred trust between school and parent,” Texas Values spokesman David Walls said in a statement. “Austin parents have no reason to entrust their children to a school district that welcomes sex criminals and sexually explicit materials in the school.”

To force this kind of pornography on school children is nothing more than government-sanctioned child abuse. The district’s policy is all about grooming children for sex.

As one parent declared, “The curriculum is an attack on Christianity and family and on parental rights.”

More than 100 citizens spoke at Monday night’s district meeting and the overwhelming majority were opposed to the policy.

Those speaking on behalf of the plan included a nine-year-old child, a fourth-grader, the parent of a transgender second grader, a lady who identified by the pronoun “they/them” and some gal wearing a t-shirt that read, “I met God. They’re queer, y’all.”

But I knew the fix was in before the debate even commenced. A good many of the district trustees had already planted LGBT and Transgender flags on their desks.

Sadly, the sex and gender revolutionaries have already commandeered a number of public schools around the nation. Instead of teaching our kids math and science they are trying to convince little boys that they are really little girls.

I write about this stealth attack on our children in my new book, “Culture Jihad: How to Stop the Left From Killing a Nation.”

And pollution from land – whether from manufacturing, agricultural runoff, or plastic waste – is causing dead zones in our waterways and Great Lakes.

Our coasts are flooding and eroding, threatening the 40% of Americans who live in coastal counties. Our safety, public health, food security, and infrastructure are at risk. If we do not act now, things will only get worse, as climate change leads to more severe weather. 

I am proud to be one of the original co-sponsors of the Green New Deal, which charts a path to transition to a 100% clean energy future, while rebuilding our economy from the bottom up and creating millions of good paying, union jobs. Environmental justice and economic justice go hand-in-hand, and I am committed to making the climate crisis and the inequality crisis top priorities in my administration. 

As we pursue climate justice, we must not lose sight of the 71% of our planet covered by the ocean. While the ocean is severely threatened, it can also be a major part of the climate solution – from providing new sources of clean energy to supporting a new future of ocean farming. That is why I believe that a Blue New Deal must be an essential part of any Green New Deal – helping us fight climate change, protecting our health, and creating good, high-wage union jobs in the process. 

REBUILDING OUR BLUE ECONOMY

Oceans already support millions of jobs, underpin our food system and contribute $304 billion to our national GDP. They also have the potential to be one of our strongest tools in the fight against climate change. Three billion people around the world depend on wild-caught and farmed seafood as a major source of protein. Yet decades of overfishing, pollution, and climate impacts have pushed our oceans to the brink of collapse. We know that we can have a highly productive ocean. In fact, ocean-related jobs have grown at three times the rate of the national average. It’s time to restore our oceans and harness the potential of the Blue Economy.

EXPAND OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY 

As we rapidly transition our economy to 100% clean energy, we must prioritize offshore wind and wave energy. Offshore wind is more consistent than onshore wind and could provide four times the present capacity of our grid. By 2030, offshore wind energy development from Maryland to Maine could support more than 36,000 full time jobs. But the Trump administration and government red tape have bogged down existing projects, making development cumbersome and untenable. Despite a decade of effort, the Block Island Offshore Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island remains the only offshore wind project operating in the United States. 

This will change in a Warren administration. As president, I will work to streamline and fast-track permitting for offshore renewable energy, including making sure projects are sited with care based on environmental impact assessments. And I will make sure that the communities hosting this new development receive a share of the benefits. Community Benefit Agreements can help address power imbalances between project developers and low-income communities by setting labor, environmental, and transparency standards before work begins. I’ll make additional federal subsidies or tax benefits for large offshore renewable energy projects contingent on strong Community Benefits Agreements, which should include requirements for prevailing wages and collective bargaining rights. And I’ll insist on a clawback provision if a company doesn’t hold up its end of the deal. If developers work with communities to ensure that everyone benefits from clean energy development, we will be able to reduce our emissions faster. Due to the urgency and complexity of building offshore renewable energy projects, my administration will seek to execute Project Labor Agreements to govern the construction and maintenance of these projects so as to ensure a constant supply of qualified, trained workers - and creating good, union jobs in the process. 

My Green Manufacturing plan also calls for a $2 trillion investment to incentivize American-made clean energy, and that includes offshore wind. My administration will work to ensure that all offshore wind infrastructure is made with a completely domestic supply chain, including American iron, steel and cement and that American crews on American vessels will be used to ferry the goods and workers to build and maintain these farms, creating more new American jobs. And I will make sure that fishing and conservation groups, as well as coastal communities, have a seat at the table in developing any new project to ensure that an expanded offshore wind industry can successfully coexist with vibrant fishing industries and healthy ocean and coastal habitats. And I won’t allow visual and aesthetic impacts to provide a basis for denying federal offshore wind energy permits. The climate crisis is too urgent to let the ultra-wealthy complain about wind turbines getting in the way of their ocean views. 

Additionally, my Green Apollo Program commits $400 billion over the next decade to R&D for clean energy, including harnessing power from wave energy, so that it becomes technologically and financially viable. I will also fight for long term extensions to two critical tax credits for renewable energy, the Production Tax Credit and Investment Tax Credit, while also fighting for a fully funded Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and Bureau of Safety & Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) so they can have the resources they need to deploy offshore clean energy resources at the speed the science demands. 

BUILD CLIMATE-READY FISHERIES 

Threats like warming oceans and overfishing have caused the ocean’s fish population to fall by 50% over the last 50 years, leading to cascading ecological consequences, hurting regional and local economies, and risking hunger and even conflict. Fully rebuilding America’s fish stocks would support an additional 500,000 jobs and generate an addition $31 billion in sales impacts, providing a much needed economic boost to coastal communities who have been hit hard by climate change. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, our bedrock fisheries management law, provides a robust framework for managing U.S. fisheries in coordination with state governments. And as we continue to rebuild and sustainably manage our fisheries, we must ensure that our regulations are able to effectively respond to the changing ocean conditions we are witnessing as a result of climate change. I will direct the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service to issue new guidance and regulations to better prepare fishing industries and communities for the impacts of climate change. 

EXPAND COMMUNITY-BASED SEAFOOD MARKETS 

As we work to restore America’s fisheries, we must also rebuild the necessary infrastructure to once again support vibrant coastal communities and a local seafood economy. Today, roughly one in four fish eaten in the United States waters was caught here and sent to Asia for processing before being re-imported for American consumers. By building processing plants in the US, we can not only decrease the carbon footprint of the seafood industry, but we can also create a new class of jobs in the Blue Economy. That’s why I have committed to spending $5 billion over ten years to expand USDA’s Local Agriculture Market Program, funding food hubs, distribution centers, and points-of-sale. 

NOAA should make it easier for fishermen to sell seafood directly to U.S. consumers and include additional vulnerable species in the Seafood Import Monitoring Program – so the public can know where their seafood comes from and that it was caught in an ethical and sustainable way. And I will invest in America’s young fishers by increasing funding for new business development programs established through the Young Fishermen’s Development Act. 

INVEST IN REGENERATIVE OCEAN FARMING

Land-based farmers have long been supported by the USDA, but in a world of rising seas, increasing ocean temperatures, and ocean acidification, we must expand that support to include ocean farming as well. Algae and seaweed are the trees of our oceans, absorbing carbon and helping to reduce ocean acidification and pollution locally, and are valuable sources of nutrition. We must cultivate them just as we would any forest or aboveground ecosystem that naturally absorbs carbon dioxide. These resources even have the potential to become a key ingredient in renewable fuels - in the future, we might power our cars and airplanes on the algae grown in our seas. 

I’ll start by directing USDA to create a new program dedicated to research and policy development for ocean-based farming, ensuring that ocean farmers, just like any other producers, are paid for their contributions to the fight against climate change. I’ll also fully include ocean farming, including shellfish and seaweed production, in critical agricultural programs, like the USDA Biomass Crop Assistance Program and disaster assistance programs, because ocean farmers should pay into and have assurance from climate-caused crop loss, just as land-based farmers currently do. And I’ll include ocean farmer training programs in the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program to continue to support America’s farmers of today and tomorrow. 

BUILD CLIMATE SMART PORTS 

If global shipping were a country, it would be the sixth-largest polluter in the world. And while many of those emissions come from the dirty fuel that is used to move massive container ships through international waters, there is also more we can do here at home to ensure every ship entering American ports – no matter what country it comes from – meets our standards. This includes working with the International Maritime Organization to set aggressive emissions standards for bunker fuels, so that shipping fuels are cleaner at home and abroad. 

 And we can work towards fully electrifying our ports, including port equipment and shore power. This will reduce harmful air pollution for the millions of people, often disadvantaged communities, who live near ports, while also supporting new manufacturing jobs in the clean transportation sector. This is not about automation. We need safe and efficient ports, and that means unionized jobs with strong wages and comprehensive benefits. And it means standing up for American maritime workers and the men and women who work in and around ports by ensuring cargo bound for the United States is unloaded and transported by American workers. On the road to electrification, we should also immediately modernize federal trucking rules by reducing idling and congestion, empowering local ports to drastically reduce emissions. Additionally, we will require all ports to have speed reduction zones, which are one of the most efficient ways for vessels to reduce emissions. And through my Green Manufacturing plan, we will continue to invest in R&D so that we can find ways to get ships off dirty diesel.

PROTECTING AND RESTORING OCEAN HABITAT

Coastal and marine habitats are our best natural defense system in the fight against climate change, storing up to 5 times more carbon per acre than tropical forests - while also often acting as cheaper and more effective sea walls. In fact, coastal wetlands reduced damages during Superstorm Sandy by $625 million. It is imperative that we restore our marine habitat to safeguard against future climate impacts, especially as climate change continues to hit our most vulnerable communities first and worst.   

RESTORE MARINE ECOSYSTEMS 

We must restore damaged marine ecosystems like Florida’s mangroves, which have been destroyed by urban coastal development. I’ll start by fully funding NOAA’s Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program, which partners with states to conserve coastal ecosystems. I’ve also proposed a 21st Century Civilian Conservation Corps, which will hire 10,000 young people and veterans for new job opportunities caring for our natural resources — including restoration of marine ecosystems. And I'll make polluters pay. My Department of Justice will go after fossil fuel companies and other industry bad actors who have harmed our ocean ecosystems, recovering the money to fund restoration programs.

EXPAND MARINE PROTECTED AREAS 

We must protect ecologically and culturally-significant places in the ocean, just like as we do on land. Marine protected areas are protected pockets of seas, oceans, or the Great Lakes which local, state and federal governments establish to protect threatened marine ecosystems and to replenish fisheries. Studies show that marine protected areas are effective management tools to rebuild fish populations and restore damaged habitats, allowing marine ecosystems to recover without the pressures of human activities like fishing, drilling, and pollution. And they can also benefit fishermen, because they replenish fish populations outside boundaries of the protected area. For example, one study found that one hectare of protected ocean produced five times as many fish as a similar unprotected hectare, raising profits for neighboring fisheries and tourism industries. I will direct NOAA to engage in robust stakeholder engagement processes to establish more marine protected areas, with the goal of increasing protection of all types of marine habitats. 

INVEST IN MARINE CARBON SEQUESTRATION 

Not all carbon in the ocean is bad. Blue carbon, or carbon stored in ocean and coastal ecosystems, is naturally sequestered by coral reefs and oyster reefs, mangrove forests and kelp forests, as well as seagrass beds and wetlands. If managed correctly, the ocean can continue to naturally sequester carbon. I will issue an Executive Order directing NOAA to build a domestic blue carbon program that will support ocean-based carbon sequestration projects, including coastal ecosystem restoration programs, just like we have for land-based carbon markets. 

I will also direct NOAA to map and establish “Blue Carbon Zones” in federal waters, so that we can identify, protect, and manage these highly productive areas. While we can do more right now to further support blue carbon, we also need to make sure NOAA and the National Science Foundation have the funding they need to continue cutting edge research on blue carbon and ocean acidification. 

END OFFSHORE DRILLING

The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill - the worst oil spill in our nation's history - caused more than $17 billion in damage to natural resources and cost eleven lives. Years later, coastal economies and ecosystems along the Gulf Coast have still not recovered. On day one of my presidency I will sign a sweeping executive order with bold actions to defeat the climate crisis, including ending all new fossil fuel leases offshore and on public lands. 

But new offshore fossil fuel leases are only part of the problem - we must also phase out existing offshore drilling, which is putting the health and economies of coastal communities at risk. A Warren administration will start by reinstating the Obama Administration’s Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program that protected more than hundreds of millions of acres in the Atlantic Ocean and Arctic. We’ll also reinstate the well safety rules that the Obama administration put in place after the BP oil spill, because the fossil fuel workers who risk their lives to power our economy deserve safe working conditions. And we’ll roll back the Trump administration’s decision to reduce the shallow-water royalty rate for existing offshore drilling leases. In fact, we’ll go further: we’ll reassess the royalty rate to more accurately account for the social cost of carbon. Over the last two decades, some of the world’s largest oil companies, including Chevron, Exxon, and Shell, have skirted about $18 billion in federal royalties from offshore drilling. That ends in a Warren Administration. 

I will direct federal ocean and coastal management agencies to begin planning to phase out all offshore drilling. Instead, we will focus on transitioning the offshore drilling supply chain and associated industry to offshore wind. I am committed to leaving no worker behind as we transition to 100% clean energy, and the men and women who have tirelessly worked in the offshore drilling industry are no exception. A Warren administration will provide job training and guaranteed wage and benefit parity for workers who choose to transition into new industries. And for those Americans who choose not to find new employment and wish to retire with dignity, we’ll ensure full financial security, including promised pensions and early retirement benefits.    

REDUCE OCEAN TRASH

By 2050 there could be more plastic by mass in the sea than fish. Ocean trash is getting incorporated into the marine food chain – even ending up in the fish on our plates and in the sea salt we use to season it. To make matters worse, there are over 300 new petrochemical plastic facilities slated to come online in the U.S, and many of these mega polluters are sited for low-income communities and communities of color.  A Warren administration will start upstream by working to establish policies that combat marine plastic pollution by reducing single-use plastic production, like plastic bags, and will also work downstream to establish markets for recycled materials through recycled-content standards. A Warren administration will follow the lead of NGO-industry collaboratives like the Trash Free Seas Alliance that have already made progress in this fight. And through my Green Manufacturing Plan I will invest in R&D so that we can further understand all the implications of ocean trash and can determine the best possible solutions to combat this issue going forward. 

HOLD BIG AG ACCOUNTABLE FOR UPSTREAM POLLUTION

Agribusinesses, with their overuse of pesticides and fertilizers, are responsible for polluting hundreds of thousands of miles of upstream waterways that flow downstream into our bays and oceans and have exacerbated toxic algal blooms, harmed marine life and contaminated drinking water. In fact, it is estimated that harmful freshwater algal blooms in the U.S. result in losses of billions—primarily from harm to property values, recreation, and drinking-water supplies. I will make agribusinesses pay the full costs of the environmental damage they wreak by closing the loopholes that CAFOs use to get away with polluting and by beefing up enforcement of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, including by working with state and local officials. And, I will reinstate the Obama-era Clean Water Rule, which provided critical protections for drinking water sources for nearly one-third of the United States. All waters of the United States should be safe for everyone to enjoy, not become a dumping ground for Big Ag. 

COLLECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL WATERS

And there’s more - because our ocean resources are connected we must collectively work with countries around the world to protect, conserve and responsibly govern international waters. Nearly two-thirds of our oceans are characterized as the “high seas,” or waters outside of any national jurisdiction. It is critical that we manage the high seas like the collective resource that it is. Much like outer space, we must come together as a global community to determine how we all have an equal share in the use of this shared resource. As a first step toward ensuring the United States is a leader and effective partner in international waters, I will work with Congress to ratify the Law of the Sea treaty so that we are a party to this international law and can work towards updating provisions to better reflect the realities of climate change on our oceans. And then I will go one step further by supporting a ban on fishing on the high seas, as one key way to curtail illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing. Just 4.2% of the world's fish catch by volume is caught on the high seas and setting aside these waters to allow species to rebuild can have outsized ecological impacts for our global fisheries. 

I will also follow Governor Inslee and the state of Washington in joining the International Alliance to Combat Ocean Acidification, a global coalition of national, subnational and indigenous jurisdictions, NGOs, businesses and other partners dedicated to taking action to protect coastal communities and livelihoods from the threat of ocean acidification. And once we rejoin the Paris Agreement, I will use the United States’ leadership on the international stage to champion how the ocean can play a vital role as a critical climate solution under every nation’s targets under the Paris Agreement. 

ADAPTING IN A CHANGING CLIMATE

We cannot hold the ocean back - it is rising and rising rapidly. The world faces an increase of about 1 foot of sea level rise by midcentury if we do not curb global emissions, putting the homes of more than 50 million people at risk. And here in the United States, the picture is just as bleak. Isle de Jean Charles, a coastal island in Louisiana, has lost 98% of its land mass to sea level rise since 1955. In the coming years it could be gone—which is why for the first time ever the federal government is paying an entire community to move inland to higher ground, before it is too late. Despite efforts by the state and federal governments, climate change has displaced several Alaska Native communities. For the Quinault Indian Nation in Washington, the rising sea level has made community relocation necessary. As our ocean continues to expand and rise as a result of climate change, we must mitigate the damage that has already been done and prepare for what will only get worse – sea level rise, storm surges and extreme weather events. 

PRE-DISASTER MITIGATION

As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and I want to ensure we protect the 40% of Americans who live in coastal counties. Studies have shown that every dollar invested in disaster mitigation saves $6 overall. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has proposed to slash funding for FEMA’s Pre-Disaster Mitigation grant program, making us less safe. Rather than cutting this program, we will propose to quintuple it. And, as part of my administration’s pre-disaster mitigation efforts, I will direct all federal emergency management and coastal management agencies to take a holistic approach to helping communities shelter from increasingly unnatural disasters. This includes better planning for escape and evacuation plans, as well as leading by example with the federal building fleet by not building any new buildings within 1.5 meters of sea level, with exemptions as necessary for military infrastructure. Across the country, nearly half a million HUD-assisted households are in flood zones. To build on the Green Public Housing Program called for in my Protecting and Empowering Renters plan, I will ensure that we do not build any new public housing within 1.5 meters of sea level, because it is the responsibility of the federal government to protect our most vulnerable families, not intentionally put them in harm’s way. 

And while my administration will take a proactive approach to guarding against future sea level rise, I will honor our promises to vulnerable communities and prioritize climate adaptation and mitigation resources to ensure that we keep our communities together and intact. This includes supporting our coastal tribes and indigenous communities with grants from the federal government to aid in their efforts to protect, restore, and preserve areas that hold important ecological, cultural, or sacred significance. And it includes working with Congress to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, to establish hazard mitigation revolving loan funds so that local governments can continue to invest in the health and safety of their communities before disaster strikes. 

POST-DISASTER MITIGATION 

Studies show that the white and wealthy receive more federal disaster aid, despite being comparatively better off financially when it comes to withstanding a disaster. As outlined in my environmental justice plan, a Warren administration will ensure an equitable recovery from natural disasters, ensuring our most vulnerable populations get the help they need to rebuild their lives after disaster strikes. Governor Inslee rightly identified the need to protect the communities during natural disasters that live alongside our existing fossil fuel infrastructure and petrochemical plants that are peppered along our coasts. I will task the EPA, NOAA, and FEMA to implement continuous monitoring for toxic pollutants by creating “mobile monitoring” teams that track pollution released during weather events. Such a program could have protected thousands in Texas from the long term impacts of the more than 100 toxic releases that occurred during Hurricane Harvey. 

FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM

The National Flood Insurance Program is designed to help people rebuild, but in the same places that were originally flooded. This may have worked in the past, but given our changed and changing climate it often doesn’t make sense to require coastal communities to rebuild in areas that are no longer safe. Similarly, communities in the flood plains of the midwest are surrounded by weak levees and will experience catastrophic flooding, not just once, but year after year. Rather than tie flood insurance to risk, which would make premiums skyrocket for some of our poorest communities living in high-risk areas, I will make it easier for existing residents to move out of flood-prone properties – both inland and coastal – including a program to buy back those properties from low-income homeowners at market value. And within my first term I will ensure the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) flood maps are fully updated, so that we can raise the standard for new construction through the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard.  

MANAGING FOR DROUGHT

Climate change is likely to cause longer, harsher droughts, especially in the western United States. That means we need to plan for increased stress on critical water supplies like the Colorado River basin, where reservoir levels fell so far this year that Arizona and Nevada were forced to impose the first-ever mandatory water cuts from the river this summer. As the population continues to grow and development increases in our most drought prone states, it is important for federal and state governments to encourage responsible and smart growth.

And longer and harsher droughts mean more catastrophic wildfires in California, which over the past several years have been considered the most destructive in the state's history. Insurance claims from the 2018 California wildfire season alone have now exceeded $12 billion, after thousands of homes were burned, nearly 100 people were killed. During the 2019 fire season, millions were left without power, putting many of the state’s most vulnerable communities at risk for days. These climate change fueled natural disasters often hit our most vulnerable communities the hardest, which is why my administration will prioritize resources for those that need it most. And my administration will work hand in hand with U.S. Geographical Survey and state governments to monitor and manage drought risks with attention to climate risks and trends. And I will collaborate with Tribal governments on drought management and land management practices to mitigate drought, including by incorporating traditional ecological practices wherever possible.

INVESTING IN OUR GREAT LAKES

The Great Lakes basin is home to over 80% of North America’s surface freshwater — and over 10% of the US population depends on drinking water from the Great Lakes Basin. But the Great Lakes are in trouble, from climate change to invasive species like Zebra Mussels and carp to toxic algal blooms that can be traced back to pollution from agricultural runoff. We must invest in our Great Lakes so they can continue to support their $7 billion per year fishing industry and $16 billion per year outdoor recreation industry. I will fight for a fully funded Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which has proven critical for the long-term health of the Great Lakes. 

Starting on day one of my presidency, I will take bold action to fight climate change. And that includes harnessing the power of our oceans to be a key part of our solution to the climate crisis. The task before us is significant, but I am confident that America is up to the challenge - both at home and around the world - to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Our oceans can underpin a sustainable food system, be a source of renewable energy and defend against the worst of climate change. The future of our planet depends on a healthy ocean, and we have no more time to waste."

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_297454,"While the youngest on the field by far, Pete Buttigieg proved on the debate stage last Friday (yes, there actually was a debate) that he was just as adept at dodging questions as any seasoned politician.

During a discussion on race, one of the debate moderators asked Buttigieg about why the disparity in black arrests relative to white arrests for drug crimes increased under his leadership as Mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg tried to dodge the question by arguing that rates of drug arrest are lower in South Bend than the rest of the nation – which the moderator quickly shot down by pointing out the irrelevance of that answer when the fact is that they still rose under his tenure. After Buttigieg then deflected entirely in the rest of his answer, the moderator asked Warren “Was that answer substantial from Mayor Buttigieg?” which drew immediate laughter from the audience (and a swift “no” from Warren).

And there’s a good reason he doesn’t want to talk about how record in South Bend.

While the discussion at the town hall focused mainly on his police department disproportionately arresting minorities for drug offenses – an even greater issue the city faced in regards to policing was how effective they were at fighting crime.

Just take a look at the chart below of violent crimes per 100,000 people in South Bend. From the point Buttigieg took office violent crimes roughly doubled from trough to peak. Even if we were to measure from before the dip in violent crime before he took office (which could just be due to variance), we’re still looking at a roughly 75% increase.



Responsible for most of the increase is an increase in rapes and aggregated assaults, while homicide and robbery rates have remained mostly constant.



As the Washington Free Beacon’s Charles Fan Lehman and Nic Rowan write:

The rise in aggravated assaults is likely driven by Buttigieg’s failure to encourage “proactive policing,” former Common Council president Derek Dieter told the Washington Free Beacon. A former South Bend police officer himself, Dieter said that South Bend’s decision under the Buttigieg administration to cut its drug unit and traffic bureau cut down the department’s ability to take preventative measures against violent crime.

“Probably 50 percent or more of drug and gun arrests are through traffic stops,” Dieter said. “If people know they’re not going to get stopped, they know they can get away with it.”

In addition, Dieter said the lack of interaction with police officers and the communities they serve outside of criminal confrontations engenders a mutual disrespect between the two groups.

It would interesting to ask Buttigieg why he thought those sort of policies would be effective – but then again – it’s not like we can expect an answer!"
Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_912727,"There is much misinformation surrounding HB 2173, and this op-ed serves to correct the record. To be clear, HB 2173 does not eliminate, dissolve, or invalidate any marriage in the state of Missouri. It does not ban marriage for anyone who can currently marry under Missouri law, nor does it redefine marriage or expand it to include polygamous, bigamous, or incestuous unions, or marriage for minors. It changes none of these statutory prohibitions, while at the same time treating every couple equally under the law. Furthermore, HB 2173 does not alter state or federal benefits. As set forth in this bill, a “Domestic Union” is the full, legal equivalent of marriage.

 Here’s what this bill does do:

 1) It eliminates the requirement to obtain permission from the state of Missouri in the form of a marriage license,

2) It eliminates the legal requirement to have a ceremony performed by a judge or minister, and,

3) It changes the term marriage to a “Contract of Domestic Union,” putting it on par with the rest of chapter 451 which states that marriage, as defined by current Missouri law, is considered a “civil contract.” Let’s discuss these one at a time.

Marriage licensure
Marriage licensure was originally utilized for the purpose of denying the rights of interracial couples who desired to marry. As such, the marriage licensure process has a shaded past rooted in racism and inequality before the law. History clearly exhibits that governments have at times used their control of the institution of marriage as a means to manipulate and control.

 Missouri did not always require a marriage license to wed. In fact, it didn’t require a license until 1881, during a period of angst in the state over the implications of the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the Fourteenth Amendment granted equal rights to African Americans, many feared that the state’s interracial marriage ban would be found unconstitutional. How else would a state control who marries? By requiring a license. A license can be either revoked or denied. And indeed, it was denied for interracial couples for nearly 80 years after the first marriage licenses were issued.

HB 2173 relegates the state to merely recording that a marriage/domestic union took place, instead of permitting one. One way to view it is like this: If you don’t need permission or a license for your Second Amendment rights, you certainly don’t need it for rights as natural as a marital union with your spouse.

Officiant Requirements
Removing the government’s mandate to have a judge or minister solemnize a marriage will ensure the government cannot control the religious ceremony or oversee a Church Sacrament. A ceremony can still be performed for a couple, of course, but it would not be a legal requirement.

Domestic Union
Many Americans believe the institution of marriage to be a sacrament of their church or religious institution. Some believe it to be sacred and holy. Some believe the institution isn’t religious at all, but merely a ‘’civil contract,’’ as our law sets forth in 451.010. “Marriage” means different things to different people. The state is only concerned about the legal standpoint. In the eyes of the state, it’s a contract, and is currently defined as such. This legislation merely describes it in its legal definition.

As marriage predates civil government, I believe that we will be on the right side of history to reduce the role the state plays in regards to the private — and to many, sacred —institution.

Conclusion
I am not proposing we sever the state’s connection to marriage, only its control over it. I propose getting the government out of the marriage business. I propose HB 2173."

For instance, it seems another major voting snafu has popped up in a Pennsylvania county … where it seems ghosts can participate in elections.

That’s right – a LOT of dead individuals are actually registered to vote!

As a result, a lawsuit has been filed against the county for its failure to clean up their voter rolls.

Maybe this legal action is just what we need to clean things up!

From Breitbart:

A lawsuit filed against Allegheny County, Pennsylvania alleges that nearly 1,600 dead people are registered to vote in the 2020 election in the county.

Nearly 1,600 people – who have long since passed on – are still on the voter rolls. How ridiculous is that?

The Public Interest Legal Foundation filed the suit, and found that 1,583 deceased registrants remain active voters.

Come on. Seriously? They can’t even keep voter lists updated?

Did you know that nearly 50 of those people have birth dates in the 1800s?! I mean, that’s just pathetic.

But wait, there’s more…

In addition, the lawsuit also claims that nearly 7,500 voter registrations are duplicates!

In one extreme case, the person registered to vote SEVEN TIMES in on day while out of state.

This is just plain unacceptable. If this is indicative of the current state of our voting system, we’re in big trouble.

If we get to November and these voting problems still exist, we could be looking at some major issues…

I think it’s high time that we start cleaning things up across the country! Don’t you agree?

SHARE to spread the word — voting and election issues must be fixed immediately!

A new report details how Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi delayed funding allocated to helping prevent the spread of the coronavirus because she knew Democrat candidates running for office could exploit the situation as a campaign talking point.
Elizabeth Vaughn reports:
Speaking withFox News’Laura Ingraham on Monday night, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said, “Look how much politics they want to play.The dirty little secret.We have the coronavirus. We need to fund this. You know what Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker, did? She withheld the bill last week. You know why? So the DCCC could run ads against seven Republicans.”
Ingraham asked, “How many people ran ads on the coronavirus, fundraising appeals?”
“I don’t know how many ran, but they actually took the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, spent money, went into these seven Republican seats to campaign against them about the coronavirus when she’s the Speaker of the House. Instead of putting America first, she put her politics first and kept the bill from coming to the floor,” McCarthy explained.
Sadly the coronavirus is just a tragedy worth exploiting to liberal and progressive lawmakers.
At a press conference on Wednesday McCarthy said:
Last week, we had an opportunity to bring forth the Supplemental, the needed funds for public health and others to deal with this item. We are not the majority. We cannot determine the floor, so Speaker Pelosi left, and had us leave Congress. This week, we hope we’re going to be able to bring it up.
The one concerning issue that I have, not as just the leader of the Republicans, but really as an American. Why didn’t we vote on it last week? And why now is the Democratic arm of the DCCC running ads against seven Republicans? On something they could not vote on, because they could not control it. Are they playing politics and holding the money up so their political arm can attack Republicans on this issue? Can they, for one time put people before politics? I think they owe the American people an apology. I think the Speaker needs to apologize. Cheri Bustos needs to take those ads down and stop playing politics with this.
America is nervous. We’ve been preparing for years in advance. We’ve got to make sure we have all the needed resources there.
So bring the bill to the floor.
That's a great question. What's the hold up?!
Earlier in the conference, the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR), spoke and said that Democrats were trying to include HR3 (Elijah Cummings’ Lower Drug Costs Now Act) with the bill for coronavirus funding. HR3 is a very controversial bill which will require some debate. Walden basically said, let’s keep this separate, because the funds to fight the coronavirus crisis are needed now.
And there it is - Democrats would rather let people die than do the right thing.

It takes a very 'not bright guy' to make the admission that Baquet did about the Times' hit piece on Tara Reade, the former Biden Senate staffer who had accused him of sexual assault.

The New York Times whitewashing piece had initially included and then deleted a paragraph that attracted a lot of attention.

""The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses, and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.""

The ""pattern"" is pretty obvious and the sentence is self-contradictory.

Aside from all the groping, there was no pattern of sexual misconduct.

Baquet then went on to explain the deletion.

""Even though a lot of us, including me, had looked at it before the story went into the paper, I think that the campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct. And that’s not what the sentence was intended to say.""

Which campaign? Not the campaign for accuracy in the New York Times. But the Biden campaign.

The paper's editor not only admitted that the paper is in touch with the campaign, but that it edits pieces about Biden after prompting from the campaign. The Times has destroyed what little is left of its credibility and the incident will be repeatedly used to hammer the paper by the Trump campaign. And the hammering will be thoroughly deserved.

Michigan's Democrat governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has had her emergency coronavirus crisis powers repealed after her overreaching stay-at-home order triggered statewide unrest.The GOP-controlled Michigan legislature took steps to reign in Gov. Whitmer’s emergency powers on Friday. The state legislature was scheduled to reconvene to review Whitmer’s actions on Friday, Speaker of the House Lee Chatfield announced on Thursday.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its spread through Detroit, a hotspot for the virus, Michigan has enacted some of the harshest emergency regulations.
The state Senate passed a bill that would repeal the 1945 Emergency Powers of the Governor Act during Friday’s special session.Whitmer has issued her heavy-handed mandates under the powers awarded to her by the act.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's strict lockdown measures have triggered protests in Michigan
The legislature approved a committee to provide oversight on Whitmer’s actions during the coronavirus pandemic, according to The Detroit News.""The state’s response must be transparent, and we all have to work together to hold state government to higher standards for its actions and choices,” Chatfield said.
""The House is taking action today to deliver that transparency and help guide the way for better results.”Whitmer has pledged to veto any bills that “limit the executive power” that she has used to direct Michigan’s coronavirus response.""Of course, I will veto bills that they send over to limit the executive power,” Whitmer said in a briefing Thursday.
""I’ve been very clear about that from day one.""“Those blatant power grabs are bad in good times and dangerous in times of crisis.”On Friday, Whitmer extended her lockdown order through May 15, but relaxed orders banning boating on lakes and lawn maintenance, The Daily Wire reported.The new order also cuts a restriction that forbids Michiganders from traveling between two residences, according to The Detroit News.Whitmer said that the legislature has a “role to play” in the pandemic but dismissed the attempt to reign her in emergency powers as posturing.""Certainly, [the legislature has] a role to play,” Whitmer said.""We have really bent over backwards to make sure that we’re sharing information with them.

""But we have gone out of our way to try to keep them included so that they knew what and why the actions that I was taking were necessary.”

Whitmer’s orders have incensed hundreds of residents who protested in the state’s capital last week, calling for Whitmer to loosen her stay-at-home that has barred many in the state from working.The governor responded to the protesters in an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and threatened to extend the lockdown because the protesters had violated social distancing rules.""When you see a, you know, a political rally — that’s what it was yesterday — a political rally like that, where people aren’t wearing masks, and they’re in close quarters, and they’re touching one another, you know that that’s precisely what makes this kind of a disease drag out and expose more people,” Whitmer said.""We might have to actually think about extending stay-at-home orders, which is supposedly what they were protesting,” she said."
Politifact_Mostly False_Press release_975827,"JEFFERSON CITY — During today’s COVID-19 briefing, Governor Mike Parson announced the first phase of the “Show Me Strong Recovery” Plan outlining how Missouri will gradually begin to reopen economic and social activity on Monday, May 4, 2020. 

Governor Parson was joined by Missouri Hospital Association President and CEO Herb Kuhn, MO HealthNet Director Todd Richardson, Missouri Department of Economic Development Director Rob Dixon, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) Director Dr. Randall Williams, and Missouri Department of Public Safety Director Sandy Karsten. 

“With favorable data and approval from state health officials, we are ready to take another step forward in the recovery of Missouri,” Governor Parson said. “Today, I am announcing phase one of our ‘Show Me Strong Recovery’ Plan, which will begin Monday, May 4 and extend through Sunday, May 31.” 

Resting on four essential pillars, the “Show Me Strong Recovery” Plan is intended to protect those most at risk of exposure to COVID-19 while returning Missouri to a new normal:

Expand testing capacity and volume in the state
Expand reserves of PPE by opening public and private supply chains 
Continue to monitor and, if necessary, expand hospital and health care system capacity, including isolation and alternate care facilities for those that cannot self-quarantine at home
Improve ability to predict potential outbreaks using Missouri's public health data
This framework will allow the state to work through a gradual reopening, leading to broader economic recovery. 

During phase one of the plan, citizens may begin returning to economic and social activities but must adhere to social distancing requirements, including maintaining six feet of space between individuals in most cases. There are currently no limitations on social gatherings as long as necessary precautions are taken and six feet of distance can be maintained between individuals and/or families. 

Additionally, all businesses can be open provided that the social distancing guidelines set forth in the new health order are followed. Some businesses will be required to take additional precautions to protect their employees and the public, such as occupancy limits at retail locations. 

“All of Missouri’s businesses, employers, and employees are vital to our state’s economy and well-being,” Governor Parson said. “Opening these businesses is going to look very different for awhile, but I’m confident Missourians will abide by the guidelines as we move forward.”

This will be a deliberate and data-driven process that allows for flexibility based on changing situations. 

Some communities may be able to reopen at a faster rate than others. Local officials will have the authority to put further rules, regulations, or ordinances in place so long as they are not inconsistent with the statewide order. 

Even as Missouri gradually reopens, citizens are encouraged to continue taking precautions to protect themselves and others: 

Stay home if sick
Wash hands often with soap and water or use hand sanitizer
Avoid touching your face
Sneeze or cough into a tissue or the inside of elbow
Disinfect frequently used items and surfaces
Avoid socializing in groups that do not readily allow for appropriate social distancing
Minimize travel to the extent possible
Additionally, all businesses are encouraged to do the following:

Implement basic infection prevention measures informed by industry best practices
Modify physical workspaces to maximize social distancing
Minimize business travel
Develop an infectious disease preparedness and response plan
Do not allow symptomatic people to physically return to work until cleared by a medical provider
Encourage telework whenever possible and feasible with business operations
Return to work in phases and/or split shifts
Limit access to common areas where personnel are likely to congregate and interact
Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance
“As we begin to reopen, we will be prepared, but the virus is still here. Protect yourself and the people you love. Take care of each other,” Governor Parson said. “Together, we will defeat COVID-19. Together, the state of Missouri will come back stronger than ever before.”

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_611324,"For the third time in recent weeks, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is attempting to exploit the coronavirus crisis to push her abortion agenda on the American people.
During the development of the first stimulus bill to tackle the coronavirus situation, White House officials caught Pelosi trying to force Americans to fund abortions because she put funding in the bill under a section of HHS where the provisions of the Hyde Amendment would not apply.
Then, Pelosi tried to include funding for the Planned Parenthood abortion company in the bill to provide economic relief for small businesses, even though Planned Parenthood is a profitable abortion corporation that technically is a nonprofit. President trump and Republicans stopped that form happening.
But because additional legislation is needed to provide Americans economic relief in the face of extended lockdowns, Pelosi is back at it — trying to remove the safeguards from the previous bill to exclude Planned Parenthood from small business bailouts in her new Phase 4 relief legislation.
Tom McClusky, president of March for Life Action, caught Pelosi’s latest attempt.
“Speaker Pelosi’s latest $3 trillion wish list is not about helping those suffering from Covid-19 – it is an election scheme focused on helping pro-abortion Democrats win in 2020. Her proposal includes the removal of safeguards in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) that prevent taxpayer money from bailing out the billion-dollar abortion-giant Planned Parenthood,” he told LifeNews.com.
According to the bill, states would be free to pass along taxpayer dollars to the Planned Parenthood abortion business from the hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars states would receive.
McClusky told LifeNews that Planned Parenthood doesn’t deserve a dime of taxpayer funds, because it is the largest abortion business in the country but also because it is “an organization which has dedicated $45 million this cycle to electing pro-abortion politicians, like Pelosi, who will do their bidding.”
Pelosi’s bill also funds abortions directly with taxpayer dollars, overturning the long-standing Hyde provisions.
“The bill would also allow federal tax dollars to pay for abortions through subsidized health care plans. And, at the state and local level, it authorizes over $900 billion in open-ended funding – so nothing would prevent this money from further subsidizing the abortion industry. This bill would be disaster for the unborn,” McClusky concluded.
On the first bill, the Senate ultimately passed a clean bill to provide funding to combat the coronavirus that contains language preventing the funds from being used to pay for abortions. now lawmakers will have to stop Pelosi once again.
Nancy Pelosi has a long history of promoting abortion and her first act after becoming Speaker in 2019 was pushing legislation to use tax money for abortions. So it’s no surprise she is trying to exploit the Coronavirus pandemic to push abortion funding again."
Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_1340,"This could be a game-changer not only for returning to our pre-COVID-19 lives, but for the global marijuana legalization movement, too.
A new study from Canada suggests that cannabis extracts containing THC and CBD could prevent the novel coronavirus from infecting human cells. 
The study, published online at Preprints, was conducted by a team of biologists licensed to grow marijuana and hemp under a Health Canada research license. Using 13 different cannabis oils extracted from newly developed strains, the team discovered that certain oils containing the cannabinoids CBD and THC could lower human cell production of two key proteins that serve as gateways for COVID-19 virus to enter the body and cause infection.
Scientists believe that the novel coronavirus primarily spreads when infected individuals talk or breathe within six feet of other people. The moisture droplets that exit the infected person’s mouth travel by air and are inhaled or swallowed by other people in proximity. As the virus travels into a new host’s throat or sinuses (and possibly even the digestive system), it stabs its “corona” spikes into a cellular protein found throughout the body called ACE2. 
Another protein made by the body, TMPRSS2, essentially turns the coronavirus spike into a chainsaw, ripping the cell open and allowing the virus to enter. Once the virus is inside of a human cell, it hijacks the cell’s DNA and forces the cell to produce so many copies of the virus that the cell eventually explodes, releasing a swarm of new coronaviruses that go on to infect even more of the host’s cells. 
Studies that predate COVID-19 suggest that cannabinoids can “tune down” the genes that produce, regulate, and activate both ACE2 and TMPRSS2. In other words, weed oils could basically block the coronavirus from being able to infect people altogether. 
However, it should be stressed that the researchers are not saying that weed is a cure for the coronavirus. Rather, cannabis extracts could work as an “adjunct therapy” in new medical products that could reduce the chances of someone getting COVID-19. 
These theoretical weed-infused medicines “can be used to develop easy-to-use preventative treatments in the form of mouthwash and throat gargle products for both clinical and at-home use,” the Canadian researchers wrote. “Given the current dire and rapidly evolving epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue must be considered.”
But before you hop down to the local bar to prematurely celebrate the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, know that there are some major caveats to this study. 
First, the researchers didn’t test weed oils in human subjects. Instead, they hit cultured human cells that produce ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with cannabis extracts. Using a bunch of biotechnology techniques, they found that the cannabis oils downregulated, or reduced the activity of, the genes that make and modulate ACE2 and TMPRSS2. 
To truly determine if cannabis extracts could stop the coronavirus from entering human cells, they would need to administer these extracts to human subjects who are intentionally (under experimental conditions) exposed to the coronavirus. If that sounds fucking insane, that’s because it kind of is, but it’s also a real thing: Drug companies are using a similar experimental setup to test whether potential coronavirus vaccines would actually work in people. 
Second, it’s not entirely clear from the researcher’s paper what the cannabis extracts contained besides THC and CBD. Cannabis extracts often contain hundreds if not thousands of different compounds, including other cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and polyphenols. While it’s very possible that THC and CBD were responsible for downregulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2, it’s also possible that other chemicals in weed contributed to the study’s results. 
Furthermore, the two most effective extracts for downregulating ACE2 were a 1:21 THC-to-CBD ratio oil and a 1:3 THC-to-CBD oil. Why those widely varying ratios both significantly reduced ACE2 activity was not explained, and could indicate that other cannabis compounds are at play.
And the final caveat: Preprints is not a peer-reviewed scientific journal. It’s basically an open-source database where researchers can share their findings with other scientists in the fastest, most efficient manner possible. Websites like Preprints enable researchers to bypass the lengthy process of peer-review — which can take months, if not years — relying instead on other scientists who volunteer their feedback to critique a specific study. 
So, no, we don’t owe any apologies to retired footballer Kyle Turley, who claimed just a few weeks ago that his CBD products could cure COVID-19. And we should still anticipate findings from other research projects in Canada and Israel that are investigating whether CBD combined with conventional medications could treat COVID-19. 
But, if the Preprints study turns out to be true, we could be fast approaching the finish line in our race against the coronavirus. And then, the US government is going to have a really, really difficult time justifying why it considers marijuana an illegal Schedule I drug with “no accepted medical use.” "

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_926469,"DALLAS, TX.- There is a lot of weird stuff going on with these “protests” turned riots in cities across the country.
There are many who were thinking that these riots have Antifa written all over them and that appears to be getting confirmed that these riots were planned, orchestrated events.
All that was needed was a spark, which was the unfortunate incident involving George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Breitbart is reporting that in Dallas, people who were in a position to observe the protests (riots) that took place in that city noted that there were multiple piles of bricks in areas of the city where there was no construction underway.
One of those areas was said to be near the Dallas County Courthouse.

“The Dallas protest was a lot of things,” said National Urban League Young Professionals Communications Chairman Reuben Lael in a Facebook post on Saturday. “But I was very disappointed to see this RANDOM stack of bricks in front of the courthouse. #setup.

Someone else in the video noted that there wasn’t any type of construction going on anywhere in the immediate vicinity where the bricks were piled up. “There ain’t no damn construction around here,” the voice said. “You’re just gonna set a pallet of bricks right there.”
Why the bricks were placed at that location, or who put them there was not able to be determined.
A Twitter user reported another random pile of bricks located on the outskirts of downtown Dallas.
A woman on Titter who identified herself as a 911 dispatcher in the city noted that the protests started out peaceful, however once it got dark outside, protesters stared throwing rocks and bricks at officer and deputies.

According to Dallas Police Chief Renee Hall, she said that she was nearly hit be bricks during the protest, according to CBS-DFW.
“Everything was peaceful,” Hall said. “Then all of a sudden, bricks started hailing (in), hitting out squad cars, hitting our officers…and then I nearly got hit with a brick.”

“So, once they are under attack from bricks and bottles of water, here comes the disruption,” Hall said. “We are an organization that constantly upholds peaceful protest, but we will not be the target. We will not be the target.”
Not only in Dallas, but in other cities across the country, bricks have become the weapon of choice for rioting thugs to use against law enforcement officers.
In San Francisco, a Twitter user reported that multiple piles of “pre-stacked bricks” outside of businesses in the city. Another user reported people breaking bricks down into “throwable sizes.”

Meanwhile in Fayetteville, North Carolina, another user reported a pile of bricks in an area where there was no construction occurring. “Some random ass bricks, bro; ain’t no construction.”
Down the road in Raleigh, a news editor at a self-described “progressive newspaper” said that she was “devastated” that bricks were launched through her window while she was inside the building on Saturday night.

“I’m devastated. We are a progressive newspaper. Last night I was inside when the first brick was thrown #Raleigh.”
Likewise, in the Manhattan borough of New York, @NewsNTD reporter Kevin Hogan posted a video on a tweet, which showed protesters breaking into a construction cache to steal bricks. “Yo, we got bricks. We got bricks!” the rioters were heard shouting as they tore down barricades.

Meantime, four and one-half hours southwest, Breitbart reported that armed Texans had positioned themselves at the Alamo Cenotaph Saturday afternoon after the monument was vandalized sometime Friday night. They went there in advance of Saturday night “protests” in San Antonio.
The San Antonio Express-News reported that the monument was defaced with “downward-facing arrows placed next to the statements ‘white supremacy,’ ‘profit over people,’ and ‘the Alamo.’”
The Cenotaph is considered sacred ground for Texans because it memorializes those who died fighting at the Alamo.
“Well, it’s all pretty simple. If you’re mad that George Floyd got murdered, well good. So am I,” said David Ahmad with Open Carry Texas in a video on Facebook.
“If you want to respond to that by burning Target, or a drug store, or looting a liquor store, or destroying the Alamo, you can kiss both sides of my ass. We’re going to put a stop to you.”

Ahmad warned protesters not to use the Floyd death as an excuse to “tear up the Alamo or tear up a restaurant,” or as an excuse to burn or steal.
A group called “This is Texas Freedom Force,” which describes itself as “Protectors Of All Things Texas” had warned that the “Brown Berets and Black Lives Matter” were going to be rallying at a park near the Alamo.

The group posted on Facebook:
“Given the incident that took place Thursday night (Cenotaph Vandalized) and the fact that PD (police department) did not protect that site, it is up to Texans to watch over our most valuable historical monument and ensure its safety.”
Another man, who described himself as a “Second Amendment advocate” said he was there to protect the Cenotaph. He is a pastor and college instructor.

“They are showing up her to do what they have been doing for a long time. For months. And that’s protecting this place. For years for that matter.” He then spoke the names of Walter Scott of South Carolina, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and George Floyd in Minneapolis.

In response to the “white supremacy” graffiti, he said, “It’s saddening because they obviously don’t know the history of what has taken place.”

“That was not just for white people. Or Hispanics. It was for Americans. That was the point whereby we still call the ‘rally cry.’ That rally cry is ‘Remember the Alamo.’ That rally cry is something that has affected me as an African American, as a black man in America, because that rally cry led toward the freedom for all of us.”
There was no violence reported at the Alamo or in the immediate vicinity. The San Antonio Express-News reported that police officers had arrived at the Alamo Plaza in riot and protective gear. They had zip ties and batons in their possession, with a few carrying riot shields.

Of course, not everyone was down with the cause. One person found it “interesting that the police are protecting the ARMED protesters…But yes, let’s still deny white privilege.”

Apparently “Belle” doesn’t know the difference between “armed protesters” who were actually trying to defend liberty and people who are committing anarchy.

That came later. What started out as a peaceful protest denigrated after nightfall, when the usual array of rioters came out of the woodwork and started problems in the city.

Breitbart Texas later spoke with Brandon Burkhart of This is Texas Freedom Force after the Alamo Plaza was shut down by police. He stated that his people had to form a line in front of Alamo Chapel to keep rioters from breaching the barriers.
“Things kept escalating and it got to the point where they asked the Alamo Rangers to call the riot police.”

There was no additional damage done to the Cenotaph, and no damage done to the Alamo itself. Burkhart said they would continue to “have their eyes on the Alamo.”"

Politifact_Mostly False_Press release_776948,"(WISCONSIN) — Trump’s failed COVID-19 response has crushed farmers in Wisconsin and across the country. Farmers have been dumping milk, setting their crops on fire, and euthanizing their livestock because there is no market for their products. All the while, millions of more Americans are going hungry because they lost their jobs.

But farmers were struggling long before coronavirus hit the United States. Trump’s chaotic trade wars, particularly with China, obliterated the markets Wisconsin farmers spent decades building in just a short few months. During this time Trump and his administration told Wisconsinites the pain would be “temporary,” that farmers were “over the hump,” and that small and medium-sized family farms should just get bigger if they want to survive.

Trump has never seen farmers as more than a political pawn critical to his reelection chances. He used their pain to push through a multi-billion dollar bailout program that was nothing more than a handout for large agricultural companies. After getting rolled by China on a trade deal that was a mere fraction of what he promised it would be, a recent news report confirms that Trump was never interested in bettering the lives of Wisconsin’s farmers and was simply looking out for his own political interests.

“Donald Trump crushed our farmers and the local economies they support because he only sees them as a bargaining chip, not human beings and Wisconsinites,” Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Philip Shulman said. “Trump has been a lapdog for China as he has rolled over for them at every turn. It’s been made clear by recent news reports that Trump gambled with farmers’ livelihoods because he thought it would be good for his reelection prospects. But after decimating these communities, they’re not willing to give him another four years — they know they can’t afford it.”

Wisconsin Examiner: Farms go from frying pan of trade wars to fire of COVID-19
Coxhead said trade policies under President Donald Trump…contributed significantly to the plight of Wisconsin farmers in the last few years. The federal government’s management of the COVID-19 pandemic has further endangered the country’s — and Wisconsin’s — position in the world economy, he added.

He also said the Trump administration’s volatile relationship with China, one of the country’s biggest trading partners, is a cause for concern. And a widespread lack of high-speed internet access in rural areas is causing many rural economies to fall behind entirely. “The global economic recovery, which will outpace the United States, is not really going to benefit us all that well because the administration has turned its back on international trade,” Coxhead said.

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_474475,"Despite the massive issues and state of emergency in Michigan the state’s House of Representatives found the time to pass a bill that creates framework for microchipping humans. The bill is highly questionable as it naturally touches on many issues of civil liberties and privacy. The bill verbage blocks employers from requiring microchips, but also creates a legitimacy for employers considering using the technology in the first place. Defining limitations of it’s use grants open turf for employers to begin experimenting with microchipping.

The highly controversial bill is called the “Microchip Protection Act” and it’s sponsored by Representative Bronna Kahle. The Act is House Bill 5672 and now that it’s passed the State House it will move to the State Senate. If the Senate passes the bill, Governor Whitmer is expected to sign it into law.

RFID chip shown in X-Ray image

Microchipping people has been around just long enough for it to start getting real. Most pets are microchipped when they’re adopted. A chip smaller than a grain of rice is injected with a needle and embedded into muscle. The chip is read wirelessly, right through the skin, with radio waves. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been around for decades but miniaturization has made embedding tags into flesh a reality. An RFID chip can be a unique identifier, then referenced against a list that has the contact information for the pets owner. If for example, a stray pet is found, it’s tag can be quickly read so the they can be reunited with their owner.

RFID tags in humans could be used for all sort of things. It could store medical information, birthdate, or emergency contact info. There are many good things that could come from the technology. However, as is typical with new technology; there are very bad things too. Opponents of the technology repeat various security and privacy concerns.

If everyone is walking around with a unique identifier, privacy is out the window. It will be very difficult to prevent nefarious 3rd parties from reading the unique identifier on the tag. This means anyone could track you. Stores could track your entry and exit, showing you targeted ads. Thieves could be signaled when you leave your home. Your movements and contacts could be used against you in any number of ways, including identity theft. All of this can be done without access to the original database. The attacker can just use your ID as an identifier to build their own database of knowledge; when you shop, what you buy, how much you spend, who you came in with, etc.

House Bill 5672  framed as a mandated limitation on the use of microchips. Effectively it prohibits employers from requiring employees have microchips. An example used by congress is for building access, where employees could voluntarily use keys instead. In some circles this could be seen as a sane step forward by enabling people to choose whether or not they want a chip. However, employers could inconvenience non-compliant employees and cause entry and exit delays that might make it less profitable to work somewhere.

Critics note that this law also grants perfect legal framework for an employer to microchip their employees in the first place. With bill 5672 on record fans of the technology will have statutes to lean on when they impose their plans. By having rules of prohibition it’s inherent that without exceeding those limits, that the chipping is inherently allowed by law, so long as users can opt out."
Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_871045,"UPDATED

Soon to be Marquette University freshman Samantha Pfefferle has yet to even step foot on campus, yet she said she is already facing possible dismissal from the school.

The threat to cancel Pfefferle’s admission came after she posted a video to her account on the popular social media site TikTok showing her support for President Donald Trump.

The video, titled “When the libs find their way to your page,” lists captions such as “When people see that I support Trump,” “Then try to hate on me,” and “And think I’ll change my views,” over a video of Pfefferle dancing.

The video features a Trump 2020 flag as well as a sign reading “Marquette 2024.” The song used in the video is rapper 6ix9ine’s GOOBA, and plays lyrics such as “ He’s mad, she’s’ mad, big sad, haha, don’t care, stay mad.”

Pfefferle’s post has been watched nearly 600,000 times and has since caught the attention of the Marquette community, some of whom began harassing Pfefferle. Others threatened her life.

“I hope you get shot,” one commenter told Pfefferle. “I’d pray for you but you’re not worth it,” another user added.

“I was extremely disappointed by the incendiary comments,” Pfefferle told The College Fix in an interview. “The response from my peers has been repulsive.”

Pfefferle explained that following the TikTok, she was contacted by Brian Troyer, dean of undergraduate admissions at Marquette, who she said told her her acceptance to the school was far from certain.

“[He] had the heart to tell me I wasn’t a student,” Pfefferle said. “This means that my classification is still in limbo and is currently being decided by the administration. I have been accepted, I paid for my housing, I have my roommates, I even have a complete class schedule. If that doesn’t make me a student, what does?”

Some Marquette administrators also asked Pfefferle a series of questions meant to judge her morals, she said.

“They also asked me hypothetical questions regarding Dreamers,” she said. “How would I respond if a Dreamer who lived down the hall from me came up to me and told me she didn’t feel safe or comfortable with my views and me being on campus. They also asked me if they thought there was anything I could do to improve my image on campus. They proceeded to ask if I was comfortable with the reputation I have established for myself. The assistant dean asked if I put any thought into the response I would be getting from my videos.”

The College Fix reached out to Marquette University, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

A Marquette spokeswoman told Empower Wisconsin that the school had not rescinded Pfefferle’s offer, although acknowledged “the admissions team did recently have a conversation with incoming freshman Samantha Pfefferle about statements made on her social media accounts.”

Other social media users are beginning to band together against Pfefferle as well.

An Instagram user has since created a copy and paste email template requesting to have Pfefferle’s admission rescinded from Marquette and is encouraging others to send the email to Marquette’s administration. It states in part:

Commenters on TikTok are also continuing to express their disapproval of Pfefferle’s conservative views.

“how can i help. she will not be going to college next year,” wrote a commenter. “Free speech does not mean no consequences,” commented another. “i love love LOVE conservatives getting their school offers revoked,” added one user.

Pfefferle is not alone in her fight to attend Marquette, however, as a petition on Change.org titled “Stop Marquette University From Removing Incoming Conservative Student for Her Beliefs” aims to keep her enrolled.

“Freedom of expression is the most fundamental of all rights,” the petition states. “What precedence are we setting for future conservative generations? We can’t afford to capitulate in the face of tyranny when our youth are depending on us to protect their rights.”

“Since when did one’s political leanings make a difference as to whether or not one can attend a college?” one petition signer asked.

The call to action, which has reached more than 1,200 supporters in seven days, petitions the Republican National Committee along with 16 other famous conservatives including former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, President Donald Trump, and conservative talk show host Sean Hannity, to help spread awareness of Pfefferle’s fight.

When asked her plans for this fall, Pfefferle explained she still hopes to attend Marquette.

“I still would like to attend Marquette University,” she said. “However, because of the death threats, bullying, and harassment, this transition will be difficult to make. As of right now, I’m being left in the dark as to how Marquette is addressing the harassment.”

Editor’s note: After publication Tuesday, Pfefferle reached out to The College Fix and said that the school on Monday finally told her it would not revoke her admissions. Campus officials still have not responded to numerous requests from The Fix for comment.

Politifact_Mostly False_Press release_356611,"DREAM Act applications roll in while Excelsior Scholarship applications are suspended by One Party Rule in New York
ALBANY, NY – The New York State Senate Republican Conference today slammed Democrats who have kept applications granting free tuition to illegal immigrants open while closing the Excelsior Scholarship application available to citizen students, whose families are struggling even more due to forced business closures during the coronavirus pandemic.

“Time and time again, Democrats show New Yorkers their true priorities and under One Party Rule, illegal immigrants come before hardworking, law-abiding New Yorkers. When Senate Democrats voted to create free tuition for illegal immigrants, Republicans said no. To add insult to injury, so many families are facing an even more dire financial hardship after Governor Cuomo forced their livelihoods shut. To close citizen students out of the application process while continuing to give illegal immigrants free tuition is ludicrous. New Yorkers shouldn’t be funding tuition for illegal immigrants at all, and we should be closing down that program permanently as we look to find savings in our budget,” said Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt.

Tuition for SUNY schools is due in August, leaving parents nervous as they check the still closed application page.

“Middle class, law-abiding, taxpaying parents are struggling right now. They and their children deserve answers. New York State should not be playing politics with their futures,” said Senator Pam Helming. 

“If anyone ever needed a crystal clear example of the Senate Democrat’s ‘Bizzaro World’ priorities that put illegal immigrants first and hardworking, law-abiding taxpayers dead last, look no further than this latest shameful policy. In January 2019, Senate Democrats rammed through their so-called ‘DREAM Act’ giving free college to illegal immigrants. I voted no and said their DREAM Act was a nightmare for taxpayers to the tune of $27 million annually. Now in July 2020, Senate Democrats show they’ve learned nothing as they’re shamefully keeping open applications granting free tuition to illegal immigrants while closing Excelsior Scholarship applications to citizen students, many of whom have families that are financially reeling due to the Coronavirus outbreak. This latest policy hypocrisy shows that the Senate Democrats continue catering to their illegal immigrant base while law-abiding taxpayers get another slap in the face,” said Senator Daphne Jordan.

“There may be disagreement as to whether those who are here illegally should be getting the benefits of legal citizens, but there should be no disagreement that state government should not be discriminating against citizen students and their families who are part of the Excelsior Program and who are anxiously waiting for their tuition relief applications to be processed.  Every legislator took an oath of office to represent the interests of the legal citizens of this state and nation and they will have to answer to those voters in November if they fail to uphold that oath,” said Senator Jim Tedisco.

“We have law-abiding, hardworking families across the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions struggling to make ends meet, paying outrageously high state and local taxes, and going into huge amounts of debt trying to afford college for their children. It’s not right to ignore the needs and the hopes of these families while we turn around and continue to deliver hard-earned taxpayer dollars to provide free college tuition for illegal immigrant families,” said Senator Tom O’Mara.

“The thousands of New York students who have been shut out of this application process with no explanation from the state deserve immediate answers. Countless New Yorkers are facing unprecedented economic hardship as a result of state actions and now the state is just adding insult to injury by leaving them in this limbo. It is absolutely unacceptable and the state needs to get its priorities in order,” said Senator Sue Serino.

“Only in NYC-Democrat-ruled New York would you send law-abiding, taxpaying families to the back of the line while giving illegal immigrants preferential treatment when it comes to college tuition aid. Every parent and student who was counting on the Excelsior Scholarship for the fall semester and is now desperately worrying about how to pay the August bill deserves an explanation as to why they’ve been put on hold while applications and aid are flowing for illegal immigrants seeking a free college education at taxpayer expense. It’s outrageous, unfair, and it symbolizes everything that’s wrong in Albany under One Party Rule,” said Senator George M. Borrello.

“Many New Yorkers have suffered and continue to experience significant challenges as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. While I believe access to a quality education is important, we should not be prioritizing one segment of the state’s population, especially during this difficult time. Our focus must be on providing assistance to the state’s hardworking residents, families, business owners, and taxpayers who are struggling,” said Senator Joe Griffo.

“Senate Democrats have been clear about their priorities since day one – those that break the rules come first and those that follow the rules take a back seat. Senate Republicans have always stood with law-abiding citizens and this case is no exception,” said Senator Rich Funke.

“It is unconscionable that Democrats would punish students whose only crime is that they are citizens.  It is no wonder that hard-working New York families are leaving the state in droves,” said Senator Andrew Lanza."

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_173071,"Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California was caught in a major lie Wednesday night at the 2020 vice presidential debate, directly contradicting a history of promises from her and her running mate to defend against claims a Biden-Harris administration would ban American hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas.

The claim came as Harris sparred with incumbent Vice President Mike Pence over how best to address the issue of climate change.

“Joe Biden will not end fracking,” Harris said. “He has been very clear about that.”

Harris would provide no explanation and no qualifiers, her campaign simply going on to suggest the claim was “fact” in a statement published to Twitter moments later.

Of course, the California Democrat’s words flew in the face of multiple statements made on record by her and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden with regard to the topic throughout the course of the wider 2020 election cycle.

According to the Washington Examiner, Harris herself suggested during a town hall hosted by CNN in the heat of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary last September that she would take action to ban hydraulic fracturing on public lands on “day one” if elected president.

“There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking,” Harris told the audience.

The promise, falling directly in line with those made by self-professed democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, could cost the United States roughly 7.5 million jobs if fulfilled, RealClearEnergy reported, citing the American Petroleum Institute.

It was apparently not radical enough, however, to keep Harris’ running mate, the supposedly moderate Biden, from falling in line as well.

Several sharp-eyed social media users were quick to point out the discrepancy on Twitter, posting several individual videos, and even a few super-cut compilations, of Biden promising there would be “no more, no new fracking” under his administration.

In fact, throughout the course of the campaign, Biden has promised to not only put the squeeze on hydraulic fracturing, but American fossil fuel production as a whole.

According to The Associated Press, the former vice president promised as much in a “intimate” public moment with a young woman on the trail in New Hampshire last September.

“I want you to look at my eyes. I guarantee you. I guarantee you,” Biden said.

“We’re going to end fossil fuel.”"

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_701901,"What’s Happening:
The media has been pushing their election narrative since the beginning of the month. They want conservatives to just give up the fight.

But the battle continues to be fought in the courts, which can decide the future of the presidency.

Trump’s team has multiple cases moving through various state courts—which can end up in federal courts.

Many believe they will end up before the Supreme Court itself. And Trump just got some good news about Supreme Court appointments for the circuit courts:

It is ordered that the following allotment be made of The Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of this Court among the circuits…

For the Third Circuit – Samuel A. Alito, Jr., Associate Justice (Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virgin Island) …

For the Sixth Circuit – Brett M. Kavanaugh, Associate Justice (Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee) …

For the Seventh Circuit – Amy Coney Barrett, Associate Justice (Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin)

The Supreme Court announced that the justices assigned to oversee circuit court cases in key swing states will be conservative members of the court.

Barrett, Kavanaugh, and Alito, respectively will be looking over cases moving through states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

That means some issues in the current court battles over election results in these states (where Trump’s team alleges voter fraud) could be overseen by Constitutionally-minded conservatives.

This is good news, as liberal justices on the court won’t be influencing the outcomes of what could be crucial cases.

Emergency applications for speedy trials get submitted to the justices overseeing those cases. So, these justices will decide if these election battles will move swiftly through the courts or not.

This means liberal justices (appointed by Obama) won’t slow down or deny Trump’s day in court.

We can’t say for sure what will be the outcome of these many battles. If there is evidence of wrongdoing during this election, these cases might decide who becomes president.

Or these cases could be dismissed and Joe Biden becomes president. Either way, having justices like Barrett, Kavanaugh, and Alito oversee this process is a good thing.

Key Takeaways:
Conservative justices like Barrett, Kavanaugh, and Alito have been assigned to swing state circuit courts.
These justices will oversee cases and can have a great impact on their progress.
Liberal justices on the SCOTUS may not be able to deny or delay progress in these key cases.

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_604300,"Public discussion and documents reveal that the FDA knows that rushed-to-market COVID-19 vaccines may cause a wide range of life-threatening side effects, including death.

Unless the public is made aware of their real effects, and is given a choice, their widespread coercive promotion as ""safe and effective"" and ""necessary"" violates the medical ethical principle of informed consent.

Act now via Stand for Health Freedom to stand up for your rights! 

A US Food & Drug Administration advisory committee meeting titled, “Vaccines and Related Biological Products,” presented online on October 22, 2020, included a 27 slide powerpoint presentation by Steve Anderson, PhD, MPP Director, Office of Biostatistics & Epidemiology, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). Slide 16 of his presentation included a “DRAFT Working list of possible adverse event outcomes” associated with the imminent rollout of COVID-19 vaccines subject to FDA safety surveillance, showing that death, as well as 21 other conditions (most which are life-threatening), are listed as possible adverse outcomes of the COVID-19 vaccines. 

In the video below, Steve Anderson discusses the presentation, which we have fast-forwarded to slide 16: 

View the full powerpoint presentation from the FDA website here.

The implications of this presentation are highly concerning. FDA staff are clearly aware of the possibly lethal side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines and are preparing in advance to be on the look out for such adverse outcomes through ""post-marketing survellience."" This approach violates the precautionary principle, which requires that a medical intervention be proven safe before being released onto the market. If it is known that the product may cause harm, and especially death, in advance, and still released without the public being fully informed of these risks, this constitutes an egregious violation of the medical ethical principles established through the Nuremberg code in order to prevent human rights violations.

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_396977,"Following only a day after our report that the FDA knows about and is preparing for COVID-19 vaccine adverse outcomes which include deaths, a newly released document on the FDA website shows that 2 participants died as a result of “serious adverse events” from the experimental Covid vaccine. 
In an FDA Briefing Document released on December 8th titled, “Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee Meeting December 10, 2020,”  clinical trial results from the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reveal two study participants died from what were classified as “Serious Adverse Events.” On page 41 of the document two vaccine recipients classified as “>55 years of age” died: “[O]ne experienced a cardiac arrest 62 days after vaccination #2 and died 3 days later, and the other died from arteriosclerosis 3 days after vaccination #1.”
As reported in the Jerusalem post:
“The FDA announced on Tuesday that two trial participants have died after receiving the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine, according to Reuters. According to Walla, one of the deceased individuals was immunocompromised.
The documents were released ahead of a upcoming meeting on Thursday of outside experts who will debate whether emergency authorization for the vaccine should be granted.
The FDA also said on Tuesday that the data they’re presented with is in line with emergency use authorization, raising hopes for Thursday.
According to Maariv, the sister publication of The Jerusalem Post, the FDA announced on Tuesday that there currently is not enough research to guarantee the vaccine’s safety for immunocompromised groups, pregnant women and children.”
This report follows closely on the heels of the discovery that the FDA’s own public discussion and documents about the COVID-19 vaccines acknowledge that deaths and 21 other conditions, many of which are life-threatening, may result as adverse outcomes from these vaccines.

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_652223,"On Tuesday, radio show host John Fredricks claimed that multiple voters in Georgia called into his show to tell him that they were unable to cast their votes in the Georgia runoff election.

The callers claimed the poll workers told them to put their ballots in a box and they would be scanned later in the day. Keep in mind the malfunctions were reportedly in deep red counties.

The comments from Fredricks came during an interview with Steve Bannon on War Room Pandemic.

WATCH: (Wait to load)

More voters on Twitter also sounded the alarm.

The voter later followed up, tweeting, “UPDATE. I called @GaRepublicans hotline and the guy said they are already hearing about these types of problems!”

“You placed your ballot in the “emergency bin” where ballots are locked until the machine is repaired and poll workers can scan your ballot. Under normal circumstances I would say that is secure. In GA…I would have found a seat until it was repaired and fed the ballot myself.”

The situation in Georgia continues to get more bizarre. Last Wednesday, Georgia’s Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Elections as well as members of the Senate Judiciary Committee gathered to hold a hearing on Georgia’s election laws.

During the hearing, inventor Jovan Pulitzer stated that he could easily audit Georgia’s election results with special techniques that would identify fraudulent ballots.


Pulitzer explained how he has “no regard for the smoke and mirrors of how the machines work” and would be solely focusing on the paper ballots.


“I don’t care about the machine,” he explained. “I don’t even care about the code that was written in the machine. What I care about is that physical artifact [ballot] and that physical artifact has material differences district to district that should not be there.”

Pulitzer shockingly claimed he could analyze 500,000 in just two hours.



After his testimony, the Georgia State Senate Judiciary Subcommittee unanimously passed a motion to audit Fulton County’s absentee ballots using Pulitzer’s process.

“BREAKING REPORT: Inventor Jovan Hutton Pulitzer claims that his hacker team was able to GAIN ACCESS TO POLLING SYSTEMS IN GEORGIA using a poll pad…”


Just days after Pulitzer gave his bombshell testimony, his investigative team was reportedly shot at in a drive by shooting. What the heck is going on and who is trying to intimidate him?

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_555766,"Journalist Alex Berenson has uncovered some disturbing numbers in regard to the less than a million doses of experimental coronavirus vaccines that had been injected in Americans through December 22.

Berenson related at Twitter on Tuesday that the vaccine injury reporting system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had received reports of 307 emergency room visits and 17 “life threatening” events for people who had received the injection of the first of two shots in the vaccination regimen. This, Berenson writes, is “roughly 50 times the rate of adverse events from the flu vaccine.”

While Berenson notes that doctors and other people may be “more diligent” about reporting adverse events related to the coronavirus vaccines than related to the flu vaccines, that seems unlikely to account for most of the increase.

It gets worse. Berenson writes that these numbers are coming after shots given mostly “to healthy people in settings where problems can be quickly treated’ and “BEFORE the rollout to older, less healthy people.” He also relates that the numbers have arisen after just the first coronavirus vaccine shot — “before the 2nd dose, which is known to be far mor dangerous.”

Read more about Berenson’s observations in a ZeroHedge article here.

When considering these numbers for adverse events after people take the first of two coronavirus vaccine shots, it should be kept in mind that for most people the risk of death from coronavirus is miniscule."

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_637239,"From our earlier report —  Footage obtained by the Gateway Pundit from militant Black Lives Matter and Antifa activist John Sullivan’s Discord server shows the so-called “civil rights activist” reveling inside the U.S. Capitol on Jan.6 as he damaged federal property.

Sullivan has maintained in multiple interviews that he regularly attends protests only to record what’s going on, but did not actively partake in the insurgence in Washington.

“It’s just recording, solely, and not being active in it,” he told Fox News last week.

After the Capitol was stormed John Sullivan appeared with CNN contract photojournalist Jade Sacker on CNN that night.  CNN did not identify Sullivan as an Antifa-BLM protest leader.  They mention Insurgence, USA but not that it is a radical leftist organization.  They do not mention that Sullivan was arrested in Utah during unrest in 2020.  CNN did not reveal that the two were working together inside the US Capitol.  Jade Sacker has done work for NPR, CNN, NBC and other liberal outlets.Yet, in footage streamed to his followers on Discord, Sullivan, who uses the name “Jayden X” on the app, can be heard inciting violence from inside the U.S. Capitol and boasting about breaking a window.

“If we don’t get in, we’re going to burn this sh*t down,” he gloats. “Let’s go! This sh*t’s ours. F*ck yeah. I can’t believe this is reality. We accomplished this sh*t. We did this sh*t together.

“I didn’t know I hit [the window] that hard. No one got that on camera… F*ck the blue! F*ck the blue!”

This footage comes from a source who wishes to remain anonymous for security reasons.



Moments after Sullivan captured Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt getting shot and killed in the Capitol, a blonde woman accompanying Sullivan who appears to be his accomplice, Jade Sacker, gleefully exclaims, “We did it!”

“You were right! We did it,” she boasts.

“Dude, I was trying to tell you. I couldn’t say much,” Sullivan replies. “Is this not going to be the best film you’ve ever made in your life?”

While the FBI and the mainstream media insist there is no evidence Antifa or BLM played any role in the deadly mob that stormed the Capitol last Wednesday, Sullivan admits in the footage that he strategically wore a Trump hat and carried a “big ass camera” at the rally to guise himself as a journalist and mislead law enforcement and the media about his true motives.

Now there is more on the two radicals who stormed the US Capitol together during the riots.

Senator Rick Scott said, “Senate Republicans are all in for getting targeted relief to Americans that are still hurting from this pandemic. But President Biden and the Democrats want to spend more than $350 billion to bailout their friends in New York, Illinois, and California. And they are lying about the need for this money. Congress has already given states roughly $400 billion to combat this crisis. States across the country are seeing increases in revenue — in some cases, well above projections. Now, we are learning that 47 states show an average decline of just 0.12 percent compared to 2019, and twenty-one of the 47 states show positive year over year growth of tax receipts. Over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois.

“This is great news for our states – but Democrats don’t want you to know this. The Democrats have made it blatantly obvious that this isn’t about helping people – it’s a payback to their friends for helping with their campaigns. Less than two weeks into the Biden Administration and Democrats have already completely abandoned their inauthentic calls for ‘unity’ and ‘bipartisanship’ just to push through massive spending and get tax dollars to their buddies. You can’t make this stuff up. These wasteful states just have their hand out to the federal government in hopes that American taxpayers will plug the long-standing holes in their budgets and pension systems created by decades of mismanagement and the poor decisions of failed politicians. That’s not fair to Floridians and all the states around the country that have been working hard to protect taxpayer dollars. We can’t let it happen.”

“To say this budget proposal is irresponsible would be an understatement of the century. More than 91% of the spending in this $1.9 trillion package is not used for pandemic relief. In fact, some of the funding is being funneled into pet projects like Senator Schumer’s bridge and Speaker Pelosi’s tunnel. The Democrats’ continue to show just how out of touch they are with everyday Americans. Students need schools to reopen; small businesses need to stay open; and workers need the opportunity to go to work. Unlike the CARES Act, which delivered legitimate relief, this bill does little to address the current and immediate needs of Wisconsinites.” "
Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_22018,"On the very first day of his presidency, Joe Biden took one giant leap backward for women’s rights when he issued an executive order forcing schools to allow student athletes to compete in sports based on their gender identity instead of their biological sex.  

To put it simply, he made it possible for genetic boys to compete against girls.  

Often the pinnacle of so many girls’ athletics experiences in high school is the state competitions toward the end of each season.


Take for instance the yearly state track meet in Kansas, where hundreds of girls compete against each other to be the best in their event. They’ve trained most of their life for this moment: they’ve woken up at dawn to weight train, worked on technique refinement for hours on end, and run miles upon miles for endurance training.

TRUMP SLAMS DEMOCRATS' WAR ON WOMEN'S SPORTS IN CPAC SPEECH

Now that President Biden’s executive order is in place, imagine that very athlete looking at the lane to her left and seeing a genetic boy lined up next to her.   

Unfortunately, we’ve already seen this scenario play out on the state level. In Connecticut, at the 2019 Connecticut Indoor Track & Field State Championships a young girl by the name of Selina Soule missed out on competing in the New England Regional Championships when two genetic boys were allowed to compete against girls. As a result, Soule finished outside of the threshold needed to advance and in turn, was deprived of a shot at winning and possible exposure to college scouts and scholarship opportunities. 

As an OBGYN, who has raised a daughter and coached countless girls in various sports, I have always stepped up for women and always fought to make sure they get an equal opportunity. I find it unfair and quite frankly un-American that this new administration is allowing biological boys to compete against biological girls in sports.  

NIKKI HALEY CALLS BIDEN'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ABOUT TRANSGENDER ATHLETICS AN 'ATTACK ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS'

Growing up, sports taught me that there was a level playing field and that we all had equal opportunity to compete and win. Letting biological boys compete in biological girls’ high school and college sports is not equal, it doesn’t level the playing field, and it’s certainly not fair.

The fastest female sprinter in the world has a lifetime record of 49.26 seconds for the 400-meter run. In 2018, nearly 300 high-school boys in the U.S. alone recorded faster times. Does that seem fair to our daughters and granddaughters? And, if one takes into account hormone therapy, the playing field still isn’t leveled. A recent study by the British Journal of Sports Medicine suggests that even after two years of hormone therapy, biological boys still maintain significant advantages over girls, including being 12% faster on the 1.5-mile run. 

'WE ARE FIGHTING FOR FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS,' SAYS CONNECTICUT STUDENT SUING OVER TRANSGENDER POLICY

This year we will celebrate the 49th anniversary of Title IX, which expanded civil rights for women and created opportunities for female athletes to compete. We should be focused on defending women’s rights – specifically women’s athletics – and not halting progress on historical efforts over the past half-century that made it possible for girls to have equal opportunities as boys when it comes to sports.  

For these reasons, I have joined my colleagues to introduce The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, legislation to protect athletic opportunities for female athletes. Our bill would remove the Title IX funding for schools that allow genetic boys to compete against girls.

Additionally, for a number of reasons, I intend to vote against President Biden’s nominee, Miguel Cardona, to be U.S. secretary of education. At a recent hearing, I asked him about the issue and he was unwilling to provide alternatives or confirm he would not allow genetic boys to compete against girls in sports. It gives me great pause that this is the person President Biden is entrusting our kids with.  

Regardless of sex, everyone should have access to opportunity and the ability to find their happiness. While those who are transgender are entitled to their rights, so too are girls who are just looking for an opportunity to compete against their peers, the genetically female ones.

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_131341,"Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has canceled his expected visit to Israel after it turned out he has not been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, N12 reported Friday.
According to the channel, Bourla, as well as members of the delegation that was meant to accompany him during his visit, have not received the second dose of the vaccine.
As a result, it was decided to delay the visit by several days, which also posed a logistic challenge because of the upcoming Israeli elections. 
Bourla said in December that he has not yet received the vaccine yet because he does not want to ""cut in line,"" and would wait until his age group is next in line for getting vaccinated. As such, he has received the first dose, but not the second one yet. 
Pfizer did not respond to The Jerusalem Post's request for comment.
""We continue to be interested in visiting Israel and meeting with decision-makers,"" a Pfizer spokesperson told N12. ""The visit to Israel will probably be scheduled toward the end of spring."" 
The Achrayut Leumit (national responsibility) movement on Wednesday sent a letter to Bourla, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and State Comptroller and Ombudsman Matanyahu Englman, urging the Pfizer CEO to postpone the visit until after the election.
In the letter, Achrayut Leumit CEO Oshi Elmaliach, who is considered close to former prime minister Ehud Barak, wrote that ""Mr. Bourla's participation in photo-op events with the prime minister may constitute aiding and abetting a prohibited election campaign and is a criminal offense."" 
Elmaliach added that any propaganda of this sort will be met with an appeal to Englman, to the Central Elections Committee and if necessary, to the Israel Police for violation of election propaganda laws.
Netanyahu said last week that the purpose of Bourla's visit was to hold discussions about establishing a Pfizer vaccine manufacturing site in Israel."

Bannon pointed to Biden’s current well being, saying that his “eyes are now dead,” also noting that Harris has had a relatively large roll compared to previous vice presidents.
“Kamala Harris is printed up in playbooks, always there for these meetings,” Bannon said as he explained how Harris is involved with a large amount of meetings. “Pence was never that. That’s not the roll of the vice president.”

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_563630,"Joe Biden’s administration included pro-life activists on a list of “domestic violent extremists” in a new report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

The Christian Post reports the report, published March 1, warned that 2021 could be a bad year of violent extremism in America.

It pointed to racial issues, “perceived government overreach,” “narratives” of election fraud, the COVID-19 pandemic and “conspiracy theories promoting violence” as motivations for potential heightened violence.

The report did not name specific groups or individuals, but it did identify several “threat categories” of extremists, including pro-lifers and abortion activists, animal rights activists, anti-government groups and anarchists, and racist groups.

“Abortion-related domestic violent extremists” have “ideological agendas in support of pro-life or pro-choice beliefs,” the report states.

The office did emphasize that “mere advocacy of political or social positions, political activism” and “use of strong rhetoric may not constitute violent extremism, and may be constitutionally protected.”

It defined “domestic violence extremists” as “U.S.-based actors who conduct or threaten activities that are dangerous to human life in violation of the criminal laws of the United States or any state; appearing to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; and influence the government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.”

The Obama administration also described pro-lifers as domestic terrorists in a 2012 report from the Department of Homeland Security.

Pro-life advocates are peaceful, and pro-life organizations condemn violence and other illegal activities just as they condemn the legal violence of abortion against unborn babies.

Often, pro-lifers are targets of harassment, threats and violence. LifeNews.com recorded nearly 200 incidents in 2019 and 2020, including a bomb threat during a 40 Days for Life event in Minnesota, the brutal attack of an older pro-life man outside an abortion facility in San Francisco, a pro-life banner set on fire inside a Western Washington University building, and a man charged with pulling a gun on pro-lifers outside a Delaware abortion facility."

The plan by world leaders and conservation organizations is expected to be discussed at President Biden’s Leaders’ Summit on Climate (April 22-23), and to be agreed at the COP15 summit in China in October.

But Survival International has warned that it would constitute “the biggest land grab in history.” Three hundred million people stand to lose their land and livelihood, most of them tribal and indigenous peoples.

The organization has labelled the plan the #BigGreenLie.

Fiore Longo, head of Survival’s conservation campaign, said today: “The plan to carve out 30% of the earth as ‘protected areas’ is a #BigGreenLie. It is a plan without scientific basis, that will do nothing to combat climate change or the loss of biodiversity, but will increase human suffering and the destruction of nature. It is a deadly distraction from what is urgently needed to secure human diversity and all biodiversity: the recognition of indigenous peoples’ rights to their land.”

The campaign is being launched with a new video, narrated by Nigerian poet and activist Nnimmo Bassey, that exposes the #BigGreenLie.

More than 230 organizations and experts have signed a letter expressing concerns over the 30% target.

These Khadia men were thrown off their land after it was turned into a protected area. They lived for months under plastic sheets. Millions more face this fate if the 30% plan goes ahead.

Among Survival’s key objections to the plan are:

- Land-grabbing: if the plan goes ahead, 300 million people stand to lose their lands, which will be turned into Protected Areas. The creation of almost every Protected Area in Africa and Asia has involved the theft of people’s land without their Free, Prior and Informed Consent. Dozens more stand to be created if 30×30 goes ahead.

- Abuses: Tribal and indigenous peoples whose lands have already been turned into Protected Areas have been the subject of appalling abuses going back decades, including rape, torture and murder. Most of these abuses have been committed by rangers backed and funded by big conservation organizations including WWF and WCS.

- A false “wilderness” solution: The 30×30 plan is just the latest plan produced by Western conservationists that erroneously sees tribal peoples’ lands as “wilderness” to be preserved for the common good, rather than as land they have managed and protected over time. Tribal peoples stand to be evicted and dispossessed to provide the comforting – but false – illusion of a solution to a problem they didn’t create.

Survival’s Fiore Longo said today: “This is a critical moment. If world leaders will meet on 22 April and discuss business as usual, the outcome will be more false, unscientific, racist and colonial proposals, such as the 30% project and nature-based solutions.

“But outside the corridors of power, criticism is building. More and more people see clearly that this will be a catastrophe from a human rights perspective: indigenous and other local people in the Global South will pay the price for environmental destruction they didn’t cause. And from an environmental perspective, it simply won’t work: kicking indigenous people off their land to create Protected Areas won’t help the climate. On the contrary, indigenous peoples are the best guardians of the natural world and an essential part of human diversity that is a key to protecting biodiversity. Their land rights must be recognized.”

Politifact_Mostly False_Press release_151890,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott released the third and fourth episode of Road Trip on a Budget, his video short series in partnership with The Heritage Foundation. Episode 3 highlights how Washington’s reckless spending is causing rising inflation, which means the prices of every day goods are going up for families in Florida and across the nation. Episode 4 discusses how Congress can work to rein in wasteful spending and why we must fight Democrats’ tax-and-spending spree agenda to put America back on a strong fiscal path. See previous Road Trip on a Budget episodes HERE and HERE.

Senator Rick Scott said, “Reckless government spending has driven America’s federal debt to nearly $30 trillion. Now, thanks to the insane tax-and-spending spree of President Joe Biden and Democrats in Washington, we are seeing six straight months of raging inflation. It’s time to face reality, ditch these foolish and wasteful multi-trillion dollar plans and protect American families from rising inflation. With the debt ceiling suspension expiring this week, on July 31, we need real spending reform, like my Federal Debt Emergency Control Act, before we consider raising the debt ceiling. We cannot allow Congress to continue mortgaging the futures of our children and grandchildren.” 

Matthew Dickerson, director of Heritage’s Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, said, “The importance of Congress exercising spending restraint instead of continuing down the path of seemingly endless, reckless federal spending cannot be understated. For instance, Democrats are looking to pass a $3.5 trillion budget kickstarting the reconciliation process to pass all of their legislative priorities, including non-budget related policies like mass amnesty, and few are talking about the consequences. This budget resolution represents more of the same fiscal irresponsibility. When the federal government grows beyond its proper limits, and spends and taxes too much, it stifles prosperity, infringes on liberty, and makes it more difficult to live the American dream. Thanks to Sen. Rick Scott’s leadership, more Americans will be able to learn about the dangers of big-government spending adding recklessly to the national debt and increasing inflation, and by extension, prices of good Americans buy every day.”

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_657117,"On Sunday, the Senate released the final text of the so-called bipartisan (but really liberal) infrastructure bill — all 2,702 pages.  According to Breitbart, the huge bill was written in secret for months outside the normal legislative process.  Buried in the measure is a pilot program for a national motor vehicle per-mile user fee (MBUF) which is basically a long-term plan to make it too expensive to drive a car.
In case you’re wondering, here’s what a 2,702-page bill looks like:

One of the “fun” parts of the supposed bipartisan bill (fun for believers of the climate change hypothesis) can be found on page 511 of the measure, which you can see below:

According to the bill, the government will seek out “volunteers” in all 50 states to test various tools for collecting the miles driven by both commercial and private vehicle operators, which include:

So they are testing how to best screw the American people so the government leftists can use Drivers as tools.
The measure also states:

The measure also says the privacy of those who participate in the pilot will be protected.
Sure, because if this happens and achieves the desired result, the participants will be ostracized by everyone except Bernie Sanders, AOC, and Chuck Schumer. Of course, Schumer doesn’t really care, he just sucks up to anything coming from the extreme left, including the Antisemitism.
“Not more than 60 days after the end of each calendar quarter in which a volunteer participant has participated in the pilot program, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, shall estimate an amount of payment for each volunteer based on the vehicle miles submitted by the volunteer for the calendar quarter and issue such payment to such volunteer participant,” the bill says.
Ten million dollars would be set aside for this program every year between 2022 and 2026, the measure adds.
Understand what the MBUF tax is really meant to do. It is aimed at taking away America’s automobiles. It isn’t about raising money. It isn’t really aimed at the climate change hypothesis. The MBUF is about making it too expensive for us to drive a car. Liberals hate our freedom of movement, and they want to take it away. They want you limited only to big cities where they can better control you.
Your car is a target for destruction. Like your job. Your religion. Your political ideals. Your… well, anything they feel you should not be allowed to have.
Embedded below is the 2,702-page infrastructure bill. Feel free to read it because no one in the Democratic Party will read it. They will just pass it because Nasty Nancy and Chuck Schumer tell them to vote yes. The sycophants are not allowed to think for themselves.

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_971563,"The California Secretary of State’s Office has made downloading mail ballots from home possible for the recall election of Gov. Gavin Newsom. The state legislature also passed a measure to send out mail ballots to every registered voter regardless if they asked for one or not.

The methods being employed by the state add to concerns already raised by a group that brought up potential voter fraud issues during the 2020 general election.

Downloading mail ballots from home is made possible through technology used during the 2020 election, the Secretary of State’s Office reports.

The system includes two options, one for the entire state and one for Los Angeles County. The statewide system is called, “Remote Accessible Vote-By-Mail (RAVBM),” which enables voters to fill out ballots online, print them out themselves, and either put in the mail or drop off at a polling location.

According to the Secretary of State’s office, there were “four certified RAVBM systems” for the November 2020 vote: “Five Cedars Group Alternate Format Ballot v5.2.1, Democracy Live Secure Select 1.2.2, Dominion Voting Systems Dominion ImageCast Remote 5.10A, and Los Angeles County Voting Solution for All People Interactive Sample Ballot 2.5.”

Even though RAVBM was created to be used by voters with disabilities, “any voter” could request to use it in 2020.

The Los Angeles County option, the Interactive Sample Ballot (ISB), enables voters to fill out a sample ballot online, which generates a “poll pass.” The pass can be printed out or voters can download a QR code and then vote using a “Ballot Marking Device” at a polling location.

L.A. County produced instructional videos explaining how to use RAVBM and ISB. It also sent voters a sample ballot stating the ISB system was designed to simplify voting because of the “large number of candidates [43, other than the governor himself] appearing on the ballot” in the recall election.

The Election Integrity Project California (EIPCa), a nonpartisan nonprofit organization advocating for the right of every eligible citizen to vote in California, purchased VoteCal voter registration and voting history files and after auditing them raised concerns about California’s election system. The group published a list of questionable mail ballots sent out during the 2020 general election to deceased Californians and those no longer living in California. It also learned that 13 California counties have more registered voters than eligible citizens.

The group sent a letter to the Secretary of State’s Office last year raising concerns about the number of registered voters compared to the number who voted in the 2020 election. It found that California had 1.8 million more registered voters than eligible citizens in the last election, and that nearly 124,000 more votes were counted in California’s 2020 general election than voters recorded as voting in the election.

According to EIPCa’s evaluation, Los Angeles County has 206,728 registrants who have not voted or updated their registrations since November 2008 who are listed as “active” voters and could receive mail ballots in the mail.

EIPCa says it uses precise methods that err on the side of caution and that its findings likely underestimate the state’s election problem.

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_52336,"Telecommunications giant Verizon rolled out a diversity training that advocated for defunding the police and controversial ideas associated with critical race theory (CRT), according to a new report.

Researcher Chris Rufo has obtained documents that purportedly show Verizon employees being instructed to reflect on various aspects of their identity.  

According to Rufo, who released the information on Wednesday, Verizon hosted an activist who seemed to favor abolishing the police. 

""I feel like over-policing doesn't work,"" said activist Adrian Burrell. ""And I feel like those same resources that are aimed towards hiring policing, and having people come in contact with, you know, people with racist biases, and all these different things, it needs to be aimed at just bringing more resources to the community at a root level, and then you just won't need so many police. And if you want to call that 'abolishing the police,' or if you want to call that 'defunding the police,' so be it.""

Verizon Vice President David Hubbard also interviewed Khalil Muhammad, who reportedly criticized police as well.

Muhammad, who is the great-grandson of former Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad, said: ""So we have a two-tier system in public education. Just like we have a two-tier society in so many other dimensions. This is really the bread and butter of systemic racism, police officers come on the back end, because they basically reinforce these inequalities.""

""They make sure that kids are locked up, if they misbehave in school, they make sure that people stay in their communities, they make sure that they're criminalizing poverty, because wealth is really the greatest protection in America, against exploitation.""

Verizon did not respond to FOX Business' request for comment.

This isn't the first time a major U.S. corporation's racial content has received attention. Rufo has reported on a number of fortune 500 companies including Bank of America and American Express. Earlier this week, FOX Business reported on CVS' intention for its employees to hold each other ""accountable"" for non-inclusive behavior.

Muhammad and Burrell didn't immediately respond to FOX Business' requests for comment.

On its website, Verizon touts its efforts to create an ""inclusive"" workplace. ""Verizon is committed to fostering an inclusive environment. We care about diversity in both our employees and our suppliers."" 

""Diversity and inclusion is how we achieve success. By celebrating diversity across all spectrums, including but not limited to race, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, veteran/military status, and age, we are a stronger company and culture.""

Defenders of CRT-type training argue it helps enhance dominant groups' understanding and empathy of what the oppressed experience on a regular basis. These types of trainings have also been promoted as ways to ""dismantle"" or weaken alleged structures imposing burdens through bias and discrimination.

Angela Onwuachi-Willig, an expert on critical race theory at Boston University School of Law, told the Boston Globe that critical race theory helped people understand the complexity of race — beyond ""simple"" narratives that they may have been taught."

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_581701,"In 2019, Congress voted to suspend the debt limit, letting the federal government rack up unlimited debt for two years. Now, the debt limit suspension has expired and congressional Democrats are pitching this as a decision point with only two options: vote to suspend the debt limit again or increase it. They want us to write the government a blank check to spend more money that we don’t have.

Republicans won’t stand for it. As spending bills by Democratic leadership rage out of control, we won’t vote to bail them out and cut them more blank checks to bury us in debt, increase America’s interest expense and fuel an already raging inflation crisis hurting families across Florida. It’s time for Democrats to own the debt crisis they created.


That’s why I recently joined 45 of my Senate Republican colleagues in a letter to the American people with a simple message: because Democrats are responsible for the massive spending and debt growth, they alone need to take responsibility for raising the debt limit.

Reckless spending has consequences, like rising inflation and growing government interest expenses. Recently, my office heard from a family in Kissimmee who is feeling the impacts of inflation firsthand. They are having a harder time putting food on the table and balancing the ability to keep their vehicle. That’s the effect of this irresponsible and dangerous path the Democrats are on.

Republicans won’t support it. We won’t vote to raise the debt limit and excuse massive spending that’s hurting Florida families.

Thanks to decades of reckless spending in Washington, America’s credit card is maxed out. The federal debt is nearly $30 trillion. That’s more than $233,000 of debt for every American family. We must get our house in order, but that’s not the attitude of Democrats in Washington.

Democrats are pushing a $5.5 trillion tax and spending spree that explodes our federal debt to $45 trillion by 2031. We can’t let it happen. It’s time for accountability that serves Florida families and taxpayers.


America’s debt is similar to the debt that Florida families deal with every day. Like any borrower, the government pays interest on its debt. When you rack up nearly $30 trillion in debt that means hundreds of billions of dollars in interest paid for by taxpayers. Like a family, the government must make choices with its money. Every dollar spent on one thing doesn’t get spent on something else. That presents a big problem when it comes to federal interest payments – and it’s something the Democrats never want to talk about.

With interest rates at historic lows, the U.S. government is already spending nearly $345 billion annually on interest. Instead of funding infrastructure, defense or the environment, nearly $345 billion is just paying interest which provides zero return to American families. As the debt grows, this will only get worse.

How can Congress justify that? No family or business would keep spending more when you can’t afford the bills you already have. In the real world, it’s not the number of checks you have in your checkbook, it’s how much money you have left in the bank. But, for Congressional Democrats, it’s about spending until the checks are gone, ignoring the overdraft warnings, and then ordering more.

This gross fiscal mismanagement has consequences. When I was governor, Florida’s fiscal responsibility allowed our state to maintain AAA ratings from Fitch, Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s. But the U.S. earns a lower AA+ mark from S&P. Just like it does for a family, a lower credit rating makes borrowing more expensive for governments, driving interest expense even higher. That’s why my administration focused on paying down the debt and driving the economy through high-impact tax cuts that helped Florida businesses create jobs and families keep more of their hard-earned money.

It’s time to show President Biden and the liberals that their debt crisis has dangerous consequences that are wasting the hard-earned tax dollars of Florida families.

I’ll keep fighting every day to put our nation on a successful path and ensure our future generations have every opportunity to live the American dream."

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_316300,"Near the top of a Google news search for the phrase “climate change” today turns up a story in The Hill claiming the media is failing to properly place the blame for wildfires on climate change. This is false. Hundreds of stories over the past two years alone have blamed climate change for wildfires. To be accurate, they are all wrong. Data do not show a significant increase in the number of wildfires or the acreage burned by them. As a result, rather than underrepresenting climate change as a cause of wildfires, the mainstream media is, in fact, giving misplaced emphasis on climate change as a factor in wildfires.

In The Hill story, “Media coverage of wildfires omits one key element: Humanity’s role,” the author writes:

Global media outlets cover [large wildfires] like the disasters they are, but too few point out that human-driven climate change is their shared accelerant. … We are burning our own house down. If we’re to survive, we need to acknowledge our pyromaniacal role now.

While wildfires occur every year and are an important element of functioning ecosystems, the scale of 2021 fires naturally raises questions about their relationship to climate change.

Since June of 2019, at the beginning of the first wildfire season for which Climate Realism was in existence, Climate Realism has refuted more than 46 news stories, for instance, here, here, here, here, here, and here, claiming supposed human caused climate change was causing more frequent and more severe wildfires. The data does not support these stories’ claims. Yet each of the false wildfire stories Climate Realism refuted, or versions thereof, have been published and republished in hundreds of newspapers, magazines, and science journals over the past two years.

Contrary to false news stories, NASA satellites have documented a global long-term decline in wildfires. NASA reports satellites have measured a 25-percent decrease in global lands burned since 2003. That is an objective scientific fact.

Also, as reported in Climate at a Glance: Wildfires, U.S. acres burned each year are much fewer now – even in our worst years – than was the case in the early 20th century. This is an inconvenient scientific fact that the United States government has since sought unsuccessfully to erase.

While media outlets like The Hill may choose to push false climate alarm about human climate change causing wildfires, and claim that the media underreports on this, the facts show just the opposite. Because the data show wildfires are not increasing in number or intensity, any story that reports otherwise is one too many."

Shock, horror! COP26 has an electric car problem

22 October 2021, 7:35pm

If absurdity were a source of renewable energy, the COP26 climate change summit might achieve its aim of saving the planet. Yesterday Mr S brought news that local lawyers are set to join rail engineers, transport operators, catering staff and refuse collectors in timing industrial action to coincide with next week’s eco-jamboree. Now Steerpike learns of a fresh crisis afflicting the UN conference: there’s not enough places to power the luxury electric cars needed to ferry delegates around the city.

Some 240 Jaguar Land Rover vehicles including its I-PACE SUVs will be laid on by the UK government to move the 120 visiting heads of state and their entourages between their hotels and the SEC venue. Unfortunately a lack of charging points means the fleet now has to be re-charged by cooking oil-powered generators. A COP26 spokesperson has confirmed that the substitute generators may have to run on hydrogenated vegetable oil – recycled cooking oil – derived from waste products. 

Compounding the problem is the lack of hotel capacity in the city which means longer energy-zapping journeys to get to the conference centre. The numbers of temporary generators provided and their locations have yet to be finalised, but there is speculation sites could include the Gleneagles Hotel, 47 miles from Glasgow.

I only visited Glasgow once, when I missed the turnoff on the way to Edinburgh, so sadly I don’t have any detailed anecdotes about the wonders of Glasgow.

Maybe I should have given Glasgow a chance, but a Glaswegian work colleague used to tell lots of colourful and rather scary stories of doing beer deliveries to Glaswegian pubs where the tables and chairs were concreted to the floor, so patrons couldn’t pick them up and throw them at each other, or how everyone took a hatchet to the cinema, so they could wave it about while screaming abuse at the movie screen, while watching reruns of “Braveheart“, so I was a little nervous about hanging around.

No doubt a vast smoke cloud from burning chip fat recharging all the eco-friendly EVs will add to the interesting experiences which await delegates.

Note: My former Glaswegian work colleague also told me some good stories about Glasgow. Like the time some English racist thugs decided to go on an Asian stomping tour up North. The tour ended abruptly in Glasgow, when they attacked a couple of Asian looking people in the pub, and everyone else piled in and defended the Asians.

Senator Rick Scott said, “Here’s my question for Joe Biden and Democrats: who is your reckless spending and socialist agenda helping? It’s clearly not families on fixed incomes, like mine growing up, struggling to keep up with inflation and put food on the table with higher and higher costs.

And it’s obviously NOT our seniors depending on Medicare who will be left paying HUNDREDS more for the care they need. We need to be LOWERING health care and drug prices and strengthening this vital program for seniors and future generations, not crippling the system and leaving families to pay the cost.

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_859652,"An FBI SWAT team raided the home of an activist mother of four in Colorado on Tuesday, Nov. 16, knocking down her door, bursting into the house with guns and handcuffing her while she was homeschooling her children.
This is the first known case of the federal government making good on its promise to not only intimidate but actually carry out a raid on a mom who was involved in her local school board politics, said Brannon Howse, who interviewed Sherronna Bishop at Lindell TV Wednesday night. 
The U.S. Department of Justice and Attorney General Merrick Garland issued an Oct. 4 memorandum directing federal, state and local law enforcement to look for parents to prosecute nationwide who may have made “threats” and made “harassing” phone calls to school board members nationwide, equating such parents to domestic terrorists.
Now a mother, Sherronna Bishop of Grand Junction, Colorado, has felt the brute force of the FBI’s heavily armed SWAT unit used against her family.

Sherronna Bishop has been active in school board politics throughout Colorado and operates a website that helps educate parents nationwide about their children’s education.
She was at home with her three children about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday when she heard someone pounding on the front door, then using a battering ram to break it down. She said the officers “manhandled” her 18-year-old daughter, pulling her up the stairs by her hoodie, while another officer put her in handcuffs and ushered her out of the house. They proceeded to search the entire house.
UPDATE AS OF NOV. 19: The FBI has filed no charges against Bishop.
Three of Bishop’s four children, ages 8, 10 and 18, were home at the time of the raid, as was her husband, who was also handcuffed. Her 17-year-old son was at his high school.
Besides being a frequent attendee at her local school board meetings, Bishop has also been active in the voter integrity movement in her state and locality. She runs the website Americasmom.net, and on that site she features an article and video under the title We the Parents: How Did We Get Here?
She said she has not been guilty of anything but speaking her mind in accordance with her First Amendment rights.
“This is still the United States of America, where we are able to state what we think and we believe,” she told Howse. “There was some pounding on my door. I didn’t really know what to think, I thought at first it might be some neighbor kids. They were pounding profusely, and then it hit me it was the FBI. I took my kids to their bedrooms. They used a battering ram to bash down my door, they cuffed me. And then proceeded to search and go through my whole home.”
She said the agents would not tell her why they were searching her home. They did leave behind documents related to the search warrant, saying they entered her home because she was suspected of causing “intentional damage to a protected computer, wire fraud and conspiracy to cause damage to a protected computer.”
“I don’t know anything about this. They couldn’t explain any of this,” she said. “I will tell you why: they were at my home to intimidate me, to shut me up, because I was using my First Amendment rights to advocate for [Mesa County Clerk] Tina Peters on the issue of Dominion [voting machines] and the damage done in our election. And they’ll never be held accountable. Instead they will criminalize this woman who has stood up.”
“I know people will say, well Sherronna, why don’t you just shut your mouth… That’s exactly what they hope you will do. I can open my mouth and say whatever I want to say and that is not a criminal action. This is about their desire to shut you down and stop you from saying it.”
“I’m a law abiding citizen, I’m very supportive of law enforcement,” she continued. “I love the Constitution. And what happened yesterday, what happened is something I never imagined I would experience in America.”
Bishop said she uses her website, AmericasMom.net, to educate and inform parents and moms regarding their children’s education.
“And since then we’ve gotten involved in school board races. I love my state. I’m a fourth generation Coloradan. Most recently I’ve been a very vocal advocate of a candidate [Peters]… She’s had to fight for her own life, and a guess now I’ll have to fight for mine.”
Bishop has been part of a group of parents that have been successful in fighting the teaching of critical race theory and school mask mandates.
“Colorado was able to flip nine school boards this year. We were able to get one of our leftists to resign and we also flipped our school board in the election,” Bishop said. “And people like me are considered domestic terrorists now, because we don’t stand for the policies that have been forced upon our children.”
Howse said history will be kind to Bishop.
“I believe you will go down in history as the first mom targeted [by the FBI]. The FBI has said it plans to do this and I believe you are the first mom to have this done to you. Mask mandates, opposing critical race theory, election theft, which Biden said if you question that you are involved in subversion. But I believe you are the first mom to have been targeted and had your door literally busted down while you were homeschooling your kids.”
Bishop said she has always made a point of being transparent.
“I have always made myself available, I’ve never tried to hide from anything and now for them to bash my door down, manhandle my daughter… I think the timing is really interesting, because we don’t want people to be silent because of what happened to me. If anything I want people to be more vocal,… because this is still America and you still have the right to stand up for yourself and your family.”
“I believe elections have consequences, and in this case this illegitimate regime is having serious consequences for all of America.”
Howse asked if she ever thought she would be targeted in this way by her own government.
“No I never thought in America that a suburban housewife and mom would have her door bashed in by the FBI,” she said.
He asked about her three children.
“My kids are very resilient. And part of schooling them has been to teach them the proper role of government and the proper role of law enforcement and I can’t convince them now that the FBI are good guys. And I really have my own doubts about that now. You cannot just say ‘I followed orders’ to go bash someone’s door down. They are responsible for what they are doing.”
Howse had just concluded a series of interviews with a panel of four retired FBI agents just days before the raid in which they had described similar raids against non-violent patriotic Americans over the last few years, starting with Gen. Michael Flynn in 2016, followed by the pre-dawn raid on author and Trump ally Roger Stone in 2019 and then the violent entering of journalist James O’Keefe of Project Veritas just last week.
“I was on the [FBI] SWAT team for several years,” said Brian Shepard, appearing with three other retired FBI agents at a symposium aired by WVW TV on Nov. 16. “And I can tell you from my experience, and I think all others of the bureau agents here would echo what I’m going to say. We never conducted a search or conducted an arrest of someone who was not a violent offender. And the thought when I heard about what happened with Roger Stone, just outraged me so much that, it just rose up inside me.”
Now, an activist mom has been targeted, raising the question: Has the FBI become the political shock troops for the White House, seeking to harass and intimidate anyone who speaks out against its policies?
Howse said it was obvious that Shepard became emotional when he began talking about how the bureau, he gave the better part of his life to serve, had now taken to bashing down the doors of non-violent American patriots.
“Brian’s reaction is very typical of men in that generation who served in the FBI, and many of those men have responded the same way, because they gave the best years of their lives to the agency, and upheld what they believed were the values of the agency, bravery, integrity and fidelity, and they become emotional when they saw how this has been discarded. They are beside themselves. It happened to others and now it happens to you, within days of our filming [of the panel].”
Bishop said the timing was not lost on her.
“I can’t explain it. I can’t explain being a target, for an agency that typically takes down the cartel, human trafficking, and now I’ve had my children traumatized and if this can happen to me, they’ll come for you too.”
“I made myself completely transparent to them and yet they chose to break down my door, terrorize my kids and try to intimidate me.”
She said the agents took her phone and other devices and kept her handcuffed for at least 30 minutes.
“No, I never had any access to any voting machines. They know I am just a voice, an advocate. We must have been effective. I know the people here, they’re not going to back down, and we’re not going to stop. In times past they never would have moved forward on this, but the narrative in America right now is one that is pushing a progressive narrative of communism. Now you can stay in your home and talk about it privately but you dare not come out and talk about it publicly …or they will send the FBI to your door because according to this regime you are a domestic terrorist.
“We’ve got to stick together and we can’t let these thugs put us into fear and intimidation.”
Howse said he was shocked by the news of Bishop’s experience.
“I could see them moving against someone like me, or Mike Lindell. It is hard to see them coming after someone like you, to come after a mom, who is working at the school board level and the election level, and to bust your door down? This is totally unprecedented by the agency in how they conducted themselves. So even for someone who has studied communism and a color revolution, the way they are doing it and the pace at which they’re doing it, I never anticipated it to move this fast.”"

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_87271,"Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 can die by euthanasia if doctors decide they might not survive, the New Zealand government has declared.
The Ministry of Health confirmed that a right to a lethal injection under a new euthanasia law could extend to patients who were either dying from the coronavirus or suffering unbearably from its consequences.
In response to a request for clarity on a euthanasia law which came into force last month, the government declared that “in some circumstances a person with COVID-19 may be eligible for assisted dying”.
The admission that COVID patients were eligible for a lethal jab came after Henoch Kloosterboer, editor of the anti-euthanasia The Defender website, made a request under the Official Information Act – the New Zealand equivalent to the 2000 Freedom of Information Act.
He said the policy left “the door wide open for abuse” of elderly and vulnerable patients – especially if the country’s health service came under pressure from a COVID surge.
He said: “It would not be hard to envisage a situation in which a speedy and sizeable rise in COVID-19 hospitalisations could result in pressure to utilise euthanasia and assisted suicide as tools to resolve such a serious crisis.”
The euthanasia law, he added, “has now made the COVID-19 pandemic potentially even more dangerous for the people of Aotearoa New Zealand”.
The 2019 End of Life Choice Act is considered to be one of the most extreme euthanasia laws anywhere in the world, and critics say the safeguards are so flimsy that they are easily circumvented.
It permits both euthanasia and assisted suicide for adults suffering from an illness which would be terminal within six months, or who were in an advanced state of irreversible physical decline or who were suffering unbearably.
The law, ratified following a referendum in 2020, guarantees all residents the right of access to a doctor who will kill them within a period as short as four days from receiving a request.
Doctors receive a government fee of $1,000 plus expenses for every euthanasia death they perform.
Just 96 of the country’s 16,000 doctors have offered to participate, however, and all but one of the nation’s 32 hospices have indicated that they will not permit euthanasia.
The one exception – Totara Hospice in South Auckland – has agreed to allocate space on its premises for the practice while its staff will conscientiously object to any participation.
In the UK, Baroness Finlay of Llandaff, a professor of palliative medicine, said the New Zealand euthanasia law contradicted the fundamental purpose of medicine and health services to heal the sick.
She said: “It is bizarre that a country which has been trying to protect it citizens by closing down completely from a virus from which people can fully recover … is now suggesting that these patients should be killed by their doctors.
“It turns the ethos of medicine on its head,” she said.
“You really cannot predict death 100 per cent,” she added. “So why not support them while they are dying and leave the door open in case they are in the group that defies all odds and recovers completely?”
At present, Baroness Meacher is seeking to legalise assisted suicide in England and Wales through her Assisted Dying Bill, which in October received its Second Reading in the House of Lords.
The crossbench peer, who chairs the campaign group Dignity in Dying, has also tabled an amendment to the Health and Social Care Bill in an attempt to make assisted suicide a part of palliative care.
In Scotland, Liam MacArthur, the Liberal Democrat MP is intending to introduce an assisted suicide Bill and in politicians in Jersey last month agreed in principle to legalised both assisted suicide and euthanasia.
The overwhelming majority of palliative care practitioners and all 12 disability rights organisations in the UK fiercely oppose a change in the law, however.
They argue that assisted suicide and euthanasia would be discriminatory and dangerous and open to abuse irrespective of any safeguard, posing a grave threat to the safety of patients and other vulnerable people.
They also say that the experience of other countries suggests that even a modest assisted suicide law would serve as a beachhead for broader, liberalising amendments which will remove initial safeguards as ‘barriers to access’.
Last month, it was revealed that Nancy Russell, a 90-year-old Canadian woman, chose to die by assisted suicide rather than endure another COVID lockdown in her care home that would isolate her from her friends and family.

Then Japan’s public and private sectors were alerted to the fact and forbidden to discriminate against those who refuse the COVID vaccine. Furthermore, Japan has made it clear that “informed consent” is required to receive the vaccine. Japan now insists the vaccine labels warn of dangerous potential side effects such as myocarditis.
_____________
NHK-Japan (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) | Japan’s health ministry has listed inflammation of the heart muscle and of the outer lining of the heart in younger males as possible serious side effects of the Moderna and Pfizer COVID vaccines.
It says that as of November 14, out of every one million males who had the Moderna vaccine, such side effects were reported in 81.79 males aged 10 to 19 and 48.76 males in their 20s.
The figures were 15.66 and 13.32 respectively for those who had the Pfizer vaccine.
The ministry held a panel of expert on Saturday [Dec. 4] and proposed warning of the risk by printing “serious side effects” on the documents attached to the vaccines.
It will also require hospitals to report in detail incidents involving people who developed the symptoms within 28 days after being vaccinated, according to the law.
The plan was approved by the panel, and the ministry will notify municipalities.

RairFoundation.com |  Japan announces that public and private sectors can not discriminate against those who refuse the experimental mRNA gene therapy injections.
Japan is now labeling Covid “vaccines” to warn of dangerous and potentially deadly side effects such as myocarditis. In addition, the country is reaffirming its commitment to adverse event reporting requirements to ensure all possible side effects are documented.
These efforts from Japan’s health authority are in stark contrast to the deceptive measures taken by other countries to coerce citizens into taking the injection, downplaying side effects, and discouraging proper adverse event reporting.
Additionally, Japan is emphasizing informed consent and bodily autonomy. Until the coronavirus pandemic, the concept of “informed consent” was considered sacred to healthcare professionals in the West.
Japan is particularly raising concerns about the risks of myocarditis in young men injected with Pfizer or Moderna’s gene–therapy treatment. The country is enforcing a strict legal reporting requirement of side effects that must take place within 28 days of the injections.
_______________
BROWNSTONE INSTITUTE | Japan’s ministry of health is taking a sensible, ethical approach to Covid vaccines. They recently labeled the vaccines with a warning about myocarditis and other risks. They also reaffirmed their commitment to adverse event reporting to document potential side-effects.
Japan’s ministry of health states: “Although we encourage all citizens to receive the COVID-19 vaccination, it is not compulsory or mandatory. Vaccination will be given only with the consent of the person to be vaccinated after the information provided.”
Furthermore, they state: “Please get vaccinated of your own decision, understanding both the effectiveness in preventing infectious diseases and the risk of side effects. No vaccination will be given without consent.”
Finally, they clearly state: “Please do not force anyone in your workplace or those who around you to be vaccinated, and do not discriminate against those who have not been vaccinated.”
They also link to a “Human Rights Advice” page that includes instructions for handling any complaints if individuals face vaccine discrimination at work.
Other nations would do well to follow Japan’s lead with this balanced and ethical approach.
This policy appropriately places the responsibility for this healthcare decision with the individual or family.
We can contrast this with the vaccine mandate approach adopted in many other Western nations. The U.S. provides a case study in the anatomy of medical coercion exercised by a faceless bureaucratic network.
A bureaucracy is an institution that exercises enormous power over you but with no locus of responsibility. This leads to the familiar frustration, often encountered on a small scale at the local DMV, that you can go round in bureaucratic circles trying to troubleshoot problems or rectify unfair practices. No actual person seems to be able to help you get to the bottom of things—even if a well-meaning person sincerely wants to assist you.
Here’s how this dynamic is playing out with coercive vaccine mandates in the U.S. The CDC makes vaccine recommendations. But the ethically crucial distinction between a recommendation and mandate immediately collapses when institutions (e.g., a government agency, a business, employer, university, or school) require you to be vaccinated based on the CDC recommendation.
Try to contest the rationality of these mandates, e.g., in federal court, and the mandating institution just points back to CDC recommendation as the rational basis for the mandate. The court will typically agree, deferring to the CDC’s authority on public health. The school, business, etc., thus disclaims responsibility for the decision to mandate the vaccine: “We’re just following CDC recommendations, after all. What can we do?”
But CDC likewise disclaims responsibility: “We don’t make policy; we just make recommendations, after all.”
Meanwhile, the vaccine manufacturer is immune and indemnified from all liability or harm under federal law. No use going to them if their product—a product that you did not freely decide to take—harms you.
You are now dizzy from going round in circles trying to identify the actual decision-maker: it’s impossible to pinpoint the relevant authority. You know that enormous power is being exercised over your body and your health, but with no locus of responsibility for the decision and no liability for the outcomes.
You are thus left with the consequences of a decision that nobody claims to have made. The only certainty is that you did not make the decision and you were not given the choice.
Japan’s policy avoids most of these problems simply placing responsibility for the decision on the individual receiving the intervention, or the parent in the case of a child who is not old enough to consent.
Incidentally, this focus on choice and freedom was somewhat reflected in Japan’s policies throughout the pandemic, which were less stringent that most countries, including those in the U.S.

Politifact_Mostly False_Press release_954534,"What we witnessed yesterday was the last gasps of a corrupt and discredited left-wing political and media establishment that has, for decades, driven our country into the ground—shipping away our jobs, surrendering our strength, sacrificing our sovereignty, attacking our history and values, and trying to turn America into a country that our people can barely recognize.

These radical leftists in Washington care NOTHING for American Democracy. All they care about is control over you, and wealth and riches for themselves.

But they are failing. No one believes them anymore. And the day is quicky coming when they will be overwhelmingly voted out of power.

Joe Biden’s voice is now the voice of desperation and despair.

His handlers gave him that speech to read yesterday because they know the unprecedented failures of his presidency and the left-wing extremism of the Pelosi-Schumer Congress have destroyed the Democrat Party.

Part of their panic is motivated by the realization that, just like the Russia Collusion Hoax, they cannot sustain the preposterous fabrications about January 6 much longer. The truth is coming out.

But for them, the worst part of it all is the knowledge that the American People are seeing right through their phony media event—which despicably compared a Pelosi-led security failure at the Capitol to the darkest days in American history and the deaths of 3,000 Americans.

The people see right through that sham. They see a cynical politician who ran for office promising unity who is now doing the most divisive thing possible—slandering his political opponents as domestic terrorists, just like insecure dictators do in communist countries.

The American People also see that January 6 has become the Democrats’ excuse and pretext for the most chilling assault on the civil liberties of American citizens in generations. It is being used to justify outrageous attacks on free speech, widespread censorship, de-platforming, calls for increased domestic surveillance, appalling abuse of political prisoners, labeling opponents of COVID lockdowns and mandates as national security threats, and even ordering the FBI to target parents who object to the radical indoctrination of their children in school. And this week, January 6 is also the Democrats’ excuse for trying to pass a radical Federal takeover of state election law. They are trying to BAN voter ID and other basic measures that can ensure the sacred integrity of the vote.

The reason the Democrats are doing all of this is not because they believe they will win a fair and honest election. It’s because they know they will overwhelmingly LOSE one.

Remember, I am not the one trying to undermine American Democracy—I am the one trying to SAVE American Democracy.

Today, I am more confident than ever in the strength and common sense of the American People. They are counting the days until we will no longer have to be constantly lectured, lied to, and dictated to by corrupt politicians and their media partners. When we will no longer have to put up with this broken establishment’s hoaxes and its manufactured media narratives—And as Biden and his radical handlers know, that day is coming fast. Because in the months and years ahead, the American People are going to speak up, take action, and VOTE in massive numbers, and we are going to TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY.

From the very beginning, all that Americans have wanted is great jobs, safe neighborhoods, strong borders, good schools, a proud nation, and a government that LISTENS to the American People. That is what our movement has always been about—and that is what we are focused on to this day.

Joe Biden and the Radical Democrats have failed on every front. But do not lose hope. America WILL be Great Again."

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_523605,"The Centers for Disease Control has finally admitted that natural immunity from prior infection exists. But it's even worse than that for the Covid narrative: The CDC admits that natural immunity from prior infections is superior to vaccinated immunity alone.

The CDC broke its silence on natural immunity on Wednesday. It released a study called ""COVID-19 Cases and Hospitalizations by COVID-19 Vaccination Status and Previous COVID-19 Diagnosis — California and New York, May–November 2021.""

The findings were reported by Agence France-Presse.

""During America's last surge of the coronavirus driven by the Delta variant, people who were unvaccinated but survived Covid were better protected than those who were vaccinated and not previously infected,"" AFP noted about the new study.

""The finding is the latest to weigh in on a debate on the relative strengths of natural versus vaccine-acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2, but comes this time with the imprimatur of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),"" AFP added.

The study itself is heavily parsed and argues that vaccination is still the best strategy to prevent Covid hospitalizations and deaths. That may be true — but only for people who don't have natural immunity from prior infections.

During May–November 2021, case and hospitalization rates were highest among persons who were unvaccinated without a previous diagnosis. Before Delta became the predominant variant in June, case rates were higher among persons who survived a previous infection than persons who were vaccinated alone. By early October, persons who survived a previous infection had lower case rates than persons who were vaccinated alone.

The CDC unsurprisingly urged all Americans to get vaccinated, regardless of prior infections. This is consistent with the agency's earlier positions.

Although the epidemiology of COVID-19 might change as new variants emerge, vaccination remains the safest strategy for averting future SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, long-term sequelae, and death. Primary vaccination, additional doses, and booster doses are recommended for all eligible persons. Additional future recommendations for vaccine doses might be warranted as the virus and immunity levels change.

But if you dig further into the release, you get a clearer picture of how vaccinated immunity and natural immunity stack up.

Across the entire study period, persons with vaccine- and infection-derived immunity had much lower rates of hospitalization compared with those in unvaccinated persons. These results suggest that vaccination protects against COVID-19 and related hospitalization and that surviving a previous infection protects against a reinfection. Importantly, infection-derived protection was greater after the highly transmissible Delta variant became predominant, coinciding with early declining of vaccine-induced immunity in many persons (5). Similar data accounting for booster doses and as new variants, including Omicron, circulate will need to be assessed.

The public healthy agency has allowed the American people to believe in the false argument that natural immunity does not work against Covid. But when you break down the numbers, you see that natural immunity from prior infection, in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, is potent protection against Covid.

One might argue that natural immunity from prior infection is actually doing a lot of the heavy lifting among the vaccinated population, as will be seen below.

The CDC's press release refers specifically to California and New York. But it's another case — Rhode Island — that provides one of the best illustrations of how the data break down."

Dr. Jane Ruby talked with longtime embalmer Richard Hirschman on Thursday to get the word out about “strange clots” being found in the veins of dead Americans.

Uploaded to the Stew Peters Show Rumble channel, the interview has already been seen over a quarter of a million times on that platform alone.

Mr. Hirschman shared photographs with Dr. Ruby during the discussion showing what the clots he’s pulling out of people look like.

Many of the deceased Hirschman has come across reportedly died of heart attacks and strokes.

The mortician says he found resistance when he tried to embalm these jabbed patients, and then found these strange materials and pulled them from the large vessels of the bodies.

“I actually pulled this long, fibrous-looking clot out prior to embalming,” Hirschman said, showing images of a clot he took out of a person.

“At the front end of it, it looks like a normal blood clot, but that white fibrous-looking stuff just isn’t normal,” he added.

The embalmer said a typical blood clot is “smooth” and falls apart easily when picked up or touched.

“But this white fiber stuff is pretty strong,” he explained. “It’s not weak at all. You can manipulate it, it’s very pliable. It’s very hard… It is not normal.”

Hirschman said the specific person with the clots seen in the photo above was vaccinated for Covid, and had also contracted Covid.

“I contacted colleagues of mine, and they’re seeing the same thing,” the veteran embalmer told Dr. Ruby.

Another image shows a person’s leg with multiple clots that were pulled out of them lying on the table.

Hirschman says he has been pulling some of these clots from arteries, which typically only happens to a body that has been dead for several days.

According to the embalmer, the number of people with these blockages has recently increased from around 50% to almost 80%.

“I’m very concerned for the future,” he noted.

Hirschman is reportedly working with other professionals in order to examine the fibrous material and determine what it is.

“My fear is this: If this is caused by the vaccine, which my gut is telling me it is – I can’t prove that – but if this is caused by the vaccine, imagine the amount of people that will be dying in the future,” he told Dr. Ruby. “Because, people can’t live with this kind of substance floating around in their vessels and it’s amazing how many people are dying of heart attacks and stroke, lately.”

He continued, “If one of these small fibrous tissues gets up into the brain, they’re going to have a stroke. If it gets into your heart, it’s going to lead you to a heart attack…I don’t want to be the bearer of bad news but at the same time, people need to know this. If it is the vaccine that’s causing this, we need to stop it. Whatever this stuff is, if we can figure out what it is, then maybe we can figure out a way to dissolve these things to help save peoples’ lives.”

When Dr. Ruby asked Hirschman how often he’s finding these mystery clots, he said, “Out of about 35 people I’ve embalmed this month, I’d say 20-24 have had them.”

Perhaps related, a UK funeral home director said in December of 2021 that he’d seen an uptick in deaths related to thrombosis, which he attributed to the Covid-19 vaccine.

“What we’re seeing is an unnaturally large number of deaths due to heart attack, stroke, aneurysm, and these are all as a direct result of thrombosis, embolisms in the lungs, the legs, various places thus causing these deaths. And these are well documented across the country,” the funeral director said.

“Nobody seems to be concerned by the alarming rise in them. I used to see blood clots very, very rarely and now I’ve seen more this year than I have seen in the previous 14, to give you an idea.”

This alarming information needs to be shared widely, and more experts must speak out about what they’re finding in deceased human bodies."

This out-of-control flow of illegal immigration that has created the crisis at the border is a direct result of the Biden administration’s policies,” said Johnson.

“It is concerning that DHS and TSA are allowing individuals to fly on U.S. aircraft based on unverified personal data provided to CBP or ICE when these people crossed the border unlawfully. This policy is a national security threat and should be revoked as quickly as possible. It is policies like these from the Biden administration that give the green light to human smugglers and drug traffickers that they can unlawfully enter our country. This administration must change course and instill policies that help secure our border. That’s why I’ve introduced this legislation to prohibit the TSA from accepting arrest warrants of unlawful migrants as valid proof of identification,” said Portman.

Politifact_Mostly False_Press release_587828,"The organized effort to rescue the children of Communist Cuba 50 years ago is a far cry from the Biden administration’s disgraceful border disaster

MIAMI – Today, Governor Ron DeSantis, Lt. Governor Jeanette Nuñez, and Attorney General Ashley Moody met with Cuban Americans who as children were brought to Miami as part of Operation Pedro Pan and faith leaders who help human trafficking victims to bring light to the Biden administration’s failed border policies which are endangering migrant children and our nation as a whole. By its own admission, the Biden Administration has stated that they lose contact with roughly one out of every three unaccompanied alien children (UAC) coming across the southwest border. More on the impacts of the Biden Border Crisis can be seen here.

“Operation Pedro Pan was an organized, pre-planned program administered with visas and flight manifests to specifically rescue children from an oppressive Communist regime,” said Governor Ron DeSantis. “While the flights of Operation Pedro Pan were designed to be hidden from the Cuban regime, the Biden administration operates its clandestine human smuggling flights in the dark of night to be hidden from the American people. The current UAC process smuggles in illegal immigrants from many different countries with no vetting, no transparency, and no consideration for child and public safety. Today, Pedro Pans and faith leaders joined together to expose how the Biden border crisis is increasing human trafficking, increasing sex trafficking, and increasing drug trafficking.”

“Operation Pedro Pan was authorized and approved by the U.S. Government to bring refugee children from Cuba to the U.S. in a lawful, controlled, vetted, and organized manner — breaking no immigration laws at the time,” said Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nuñez. “By contrast, the chaos at our southern border means that in the last year alone, about 2 million migrants from all over the world have crossed our border illegally. President Biden’s reckless open-border policies have incentivized a mass influx, in which murderous drug cartels, gang members, and human traffickers are smuggling individuals across the border or worse yet, posing as children. With our Administration’s efforts, Governor DeSantis and I are refusing to perpetuate bad policy, we are standing on the side of law and order, and we are seeking to protect Floridians from Biden’s open border agenda.”

“I am honored to fight alongside Governor Ron DeSantis as we protect Floridians from a federal government that violates its own immigration laws and intentionally makes this country less safe,” said Attorney General Ashley Moody. “Florida stands united against crime, lawlessness, and a federal government that is using taxpayer funds and clandestine means to flood our state with unvetted, illegal immigrants—all while keeping our leaders in the dark about who is being relocated to our state.”

“If you can see in this museum, when we came over here, we thought it was temporary and that the communist government of Cuba would end,” said Maximo Alvarez, Operation Pedro Pan Refugee. “Let me assure you that they knew exactly who I was, they knew who my parents were. They are using this program to convince people that this is similar to what is happening today. Not even close. This is the way that communism works — remember the ends justify the means. What is happening right now, you see children as merchandise and these cartels are using these kids as merchandise for personal gain. When I came, we came directly into the hands of the church, and we were treated like family. We are so proud of our governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Attorney General. We are in great hands in the state of Florida.”

“We came into the hands of the church, we had documents, none of us got lost, anything that had to do with us our parents would be consulted,” said Carmen Valdivia, Executive Director of the American Museum of the Cuban Diaspora. “Each of us were put into a group that would take care of our faith because that is what our parents wanted. To put children on the frontline and use them to put a political agenda through is inconceivable. When you experience communism, you see what is happening and you know the steps that you go through to get to communism.”

 “These conversations have to begin and end with what is best for the child,” said Dr. Jerry Haag, CEO of One More Child. “Today, regarding children, we have a failing foreign policy that is creating a domestic disaster for children as they are incentivized to become victims and make this trek all the way to the United States. We can no longer incentivize children to make that journey where they are victimized, abused and trafficked.”

“Poverty is not persecution and lawlessness is not godly,” said Jack Brewer, Founder and Executive Director of the Jack Brewer Foundation. “We have to help people where they are. To incentivize a few who are able bodied enough to get to the border and use hundreds of millions of dollars to do so when we could go into those countries and actually establish programs and give people an opportunity and a chance and Florida is a catalyst for that opportunity.”

During Operation Pedro Pan, more than 14,000 Cuban children were evacuated from Cuba after the takeover of the brutal Castro Regime and were flown to Miami. Operation Pedro Pan was an organized refugee program aimed at protecting children from political persecution in Cuba, which is much different than what is occurring today. The Biden Administration’s open border policies are incentivizing the mass trafficking of minors through Central America to the cartel controlled southern border, a much more dangerous journey than that of Operation Pedro Pan.

Governor DeSantis has been steadfast and innovative in his efforts to shield Floridians, including vulnerable children, from the dangers of failed federal immigration policies by:

Appointing a Public Safety Czar to coordinate an interagency approach to protect Floridians from illegal immigration;
Sending Florida law enforcement to the border and travelling to Texas to see for himself the ongoing catastrophe and the important role that our Florida law enforcement played in stopping drug smuggling and human trafficking;
Prohibiting the issuance or renewal of any license to organizations or companies that house unaccompanied alien minors who seek to be resettled in Florida;
Pushing back on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as they attempt to defend Biden’s failed immigration policies which are in turn harming children; and
Announcing proposals for the current Legislative Session to hold accountable private entities that knowingly or recklessly assist the Biden Administration in resettling illegal immigrants into Florida."

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_826309,"New York's wetlands are important to nearly every living being in our state. They provide critical habitat for species like ducks, deer, and turkeys – and you may already know that they are home to nearly half of the threatened and endangered species in the state. 

But believe it or not, wetlands provide even more benefits for the people of New York. From absorbing flooding and storm surge, to filtering water of pollutants and acting as one of the most effective carbon sinks, wetlands play a critical role in protecting our state from the worst impacts of climate change. Wetlands store 35% of the world's carbon – that's equivalent to the carbon emissions from roughly 189 million cars every year!

However, despite all of these benefits, our wetlands are constantly under threat. New York State has already lost 60% of its historic freshwater wetlands. Unfortunately, the way we protect wetlands in the state is woefully outdated, and in many cases has led to a lack of protection for the most critical wetlands. The current Freshwater Wetlands Law only protects wetlands 12.4 acres and larger that appear on a set of jurisdictional maps.

These maps were created in the 1970s and 1980s with outdated technology, leading to nearly 1 million acres of wetlands lacking any state-level protection. You read that right – there are 1 million acres of wetlands that should be protected, but are not because of these arcane maps. Additionally, for any wetland smaller than 12.4 acres, there is a murky set of rules used by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) that often makes it unclear to both regulators and landowners where a wetland exists and whether it should be protected. 

For years, individuals and organizations throughout the state have been sounding the rallying cry to protect these wetlands and make the system clearer for all. In 2021, these efforts led to legislation being introduced in the state that would detach the outdated wetland maps from determining which wetlands are protected – reforms that ultimately appeared in Governor Hochul's proposed budget for 2022. If they are included in the final state budget, these reforms will mark the most significant improvement to this law in three decades. The reforms would provide protection for wetlands smaller than 12.4 acres that have “unusual importance” and any wetland larger than 12.4 acres, saving 1 million acres of wetlands. 

The criteria the DEC can use to protect wetlands would be made clearer, removing confusion when determining whether a wetland requires protection. These criteria are clearly presented and use measurable, scientific features (like the existence of aquatic plants and hydric soils) that will definitively determine whether an area is considered a wetland. One such aspect is the focus on “state species of special concern,” which ensures the state's most vulnerable bird, animal, and plant species – like the American Black Duck and Saltmarsh Sparrow – will have their habitats protected. With the persistent uncertainty surrounding wetlands protections at the federal level, it's time for New York to take care of its wetlands on its own terms. 

As an avid outdoorsman and as a legislator, I've seen firsthand the vital role wetlands play for both outdoor recreation and preventing property damage and loss of life. With the increasing frequency of flooding events throughout the state, natural infrastructure provides an effective and economical way to protect our communities and our environment. Having co-sponsored legislation to make these changes, I'm fully supportive of the reforms proposed in Governor Hochul's budget and will work to include them in the Senate's budget this spring. These changes are a long time coming – for the wetlands and for all of New York."

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_382360,"Hawley hits back at Durbin, says Jackson’s record ‘concerning’
Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., on Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation hearing.

Last week, I pointed out on Twitter that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson – up for confirmation to our nation’s highest court – has an alarming pattern of going soft on child pornography offenders. And she does. 

As early as law school, Jackson was complaining of the ""current climate of fear, hatred, and revenge associated with the release of convicted sex offenders."" While serving on the Sentencing Commission, she supported eliminating the existing child pornography mandatory-minimum sentence. Those views carried over to Judge Jackson’s time on the bench. Over and over again, she handed down sentences well below the congressionally endorsed Sentencing Guidelines recommendations. Unfortunately, Jackson is not the first judge to do that. But she stands out because she also consistently sentenced child pornography offenders below even what liberal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., were seeking.  

Sen. Josh Hawley meets Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, in his office at the Capitol on March 9, 2022. (Reuters/Evelyn Hockstein)

In one of the most egregious cases (United States v. Hawkins), involving an adult man who uploaded videos of underage children engaging in sexual behavior to YouTube, Judge Jackson sentenced the offender to just three months in prison, even though the Sentencing Guidelines recommended an 8- to 10-year sentence and the Obama administration sought a sentence of several years.  

In fact, in every case for which I can find records and Judge Jackson had discretion, she gave child porn offenders sentences below the guidelines and below what the prosecutors were requesting. This isn’t a one-off. It’s a pattern. 

The responses from Democrats and their sycophants in the press, after I raised these concerns, have been very illuminating. 

They seem to be coalescing around a disturbing line of response: everybody does it. That is to say, Jackson’s record of leniency doesn’t really matter, because other federal judges repeatedly deviate from the guidelines in child pornography cases, prosecutors and probation officers steeped in progressive ideology often request below-guidelines sentences, and a chorus of left-wing law professors, criminologists and psychologists all believe that we’re too tough on sex offenders. 

In other words, if Judge Jackson’s record bothers you, you’re just too dumb. Better leave this stuff to the experts. 

In our constitutional order, the ""experts"" don’t run the show. The people do. 

That’s nonsense. First, Judge Jackson is even softer on child pornography offenders than the Obama and Biden administrations. And second, you don’t need a Ph.D. in criminology to recognize that someone who circulates dozens of videos of young girls being sexually assaulted by adult men and women, and sends around lewd images of his own daughter (United States v. Sears), should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.  

We’ve been in this exact situation before. 

In the early 2000s, when the Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory, judges regularly departed downward from the guidelines in child pornography cases for dubious reasons. In one particularly notorious case, United States v. Parish, a judge cut a child pornography defendant’s sentence in half on the theory that he would be ""highly susceptible to abuse in prison."" (The defendant was almost 6 feet tall and weighed nearly 200 pounds.) In the words of then-Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, ""this is simply incredible and outrageous. Congress has to act, and it has to act now."" 

And Congress did. Congress passed the PROTECT Act of 2003, which cut back on judges’ ability to downwardly depart from guidelines-recommended sentences in sex offense cases. It also created a five-year mandatory minimum sentence, which Judge Jackson is on record trying to eliminate.  

Sen. Hatch explained that the bill ""would simply require judges to sentence these vicious defendants in accordance with the law and not seek new areas or new legal justifications for reducing sentences for these defendants without specific authorization from the U.S. Sentencing Commission."" And the bill passed the Senate by an 84-0 vote– notably, with Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as well as many other Democrats, all voting in favor.  

That law didn’t sit well with lenient judges. And, after the Supreme Court found that the Sentencing Guidelines weren’t binding – cutting the PROTECT Act’s reforms off at the knees – the original problem recurred. As Judge Jackson’s record reflects, we’re back to the not-so-good old days of going easy on child porn offenders. 

We’ve seen the results of this lenient approach. In the late 2000s, the number of child pornography depictions online was just under a million. That was way too many. But now it’s worse. Last year, it was 85 million. The soft-on-crime attitude of the so-called ""experts"" has created an epidemic.   

This trend, ultimately, is a betrayal of our democracy. When the question is put to them and their elected representatives, the American public speaks with one voice: child pornography offenders should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. In our constitutional order, the ""experts"" don’t run the show. The people do. And ordinary Americans are not interested in going soft on sex criminals. 

That’s why downward deviation from the guidelines matters – because those deviations are fundamentally out of step with how Americans want to protect their kids from the worst of the worst. Frankly, I can’t say it any better than Sen. Hatch did in 2003, ""This many departures happens to be very disturbing and astounding considering the magnitude of the suffering by our nation’s youth at the hands of pedophiles, molesters and pornographers.""  

Once upon a time, Sens. Durbin, Feinstein, Schumer, and many other Senate Democrats agreed with him. I still do.

Politifact_Mostly False_Press release_296819,"MADISON — In a year when students across the nation experienced declines, Wisconsin elementary school students held steady in mathematics and reading assessment scores released today by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), also known as the “Nation’s Report Card.” Consistent with national trends, Wisconsin eighth grade students experienced declines in both subjects, but overall scores remained at or above the national average.
 
“The results released today reiterate trends we have seen across the nation as students continue to recover from learning disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” State Superintendent Dr. Jill Underly said. “Recovery is a continuous journey, and we haven’t yet reached a destination we are satisfied with, nor do we just want to return to where we were before. What is clear is that Wisconsin students, educators, and schools need our support more than ever. They are our future, and we owe it to them to invest in their success and ensure they are well prepared to lead this state.”
 
The 2022 NAEP results are the first glimpse at how the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected students academically on the national level. NAEP is the largest nationally representative and continuing assessment of what the nation’s students know and can do in various subject areas.
 
In mathematics, Wisconsin was one of 10 states/jurisdictions without any significant statistical change among fourth graders from 2019, with students performing above the national average scale score. In the same subject, the state’s eighth graders were among 51 states/jurisdictions experiencing score declines from 2019, though Wisconsin eighth graders remain above the national average. In reading, Wisconsin fourth graders were among 22 states/jurisdictions that did not experience a significant statistical change from 2019. Wisconsin eighth graders were among 33 states/jurisdictions experiencing a decline in reading scores from 2019.
 
NAEP results also showed the Black to white opportunity gap among Wisconsin fourth and eighth graders persists in both mathematics and reading. Wisconsin’s opportunity gap between Black and white students remains the widest among all states/jurisdictions, except the District of Columbia, according to NAEP results.
 
“We’ve known Wisconsin’s racial disparities in assessment results are among the widest in the nation for too long, and these troubling results are yet one more indication that we must close the opportunity gap in our state,” Dr. Underly said. “We need continued investment, intervention, and innovation in our state, and we have the means to accomplish exactly that. Our biennial budget request will help put targeted resources and supports in our schools and ensure we are helping the students who need it the most at this critical time. They deserve no less, and neither do we.”
 
The 2022 NAEP was taken by students from January to March 2022 and was previously taken by students in early 2019. The national assessment is typically administered on a two-year basis. About 2,200 Wisconsin fourth graders and about 2,600 eighth graders were tested in reading. About 2,300 Wisconsin fourth graders and about 2,500 eighth graders were tested in mathematics.
 
Wisconsin’s full state report can be found on the NAEP website, along with the national report. For more information on NAEP in Wisconsin, visit the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction’s website.
 
Results for NAEP’s Trial Urban District Assessment were also released today with state results. Milwaukee Public Schools is among 26 large urban school districts that participate in TUDA. More information and results for TUDAs can be found on the NAEP’s website.

You probably missed it, but in September 2022, the White House hosted a conference that focused on nutrition, health, and hunger in America. Dariush Mozaffarian, who was one of the main organizers of the event and is currently Dean of the Tufts School of Nutrition — presented a newly designed food pyramid that only cost 3 years of time and millions of taxpayer dollars. The new wisdom they found? Lucky Charms are healthier than steak.

Don’t believe me? Here’s some results pulled out of the Tuft Food Compass

As you can see, Lucky Charms receives a 60 while ground beef is at a 26. Beef Steak ranked a little above 30 on the chart, which means both beef items received half the score of Lucky Charms. If we turn our attention to the green section, we see that chocolate covered almonds received a 78 and should “be encouraged” in someone’s diet. Chocolate covered nuts should be encouraged while beef and a majority of commonly consumed meats should be minimized.

This new food pyramid is being touted as the most comprehensive and science-based nutrient profiling system to date, which honestly just isn’t a surprise anymore. This is happening in a country where congress declared pizza to be a vegetable, and if tomato paste can make pizza a vegetable then maybe luck can make the charms healthy.

The concerning thing is that these ridiculous studies impact the food kids eat day to day at school. They also impact average people’s views of nutrition.

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_8406,"Covid booster doses will no longer be available to healthy people under 50 from next month, the Government has said. The reason given by the JCVI, the Government’s vaccine advisory body, is because “the transition continues away from a pandemic emergency response towards pandemic recovery”. A number of countries have imposed similar bans on boosters for healthy under-50s, a trend that has been linked by observers to safety concerns, though public authorities have not confirmed this. The U.K. will continue to offer the first two doses to over-16s.
The Government has also accepted JCVI advice that another round of Covid booster jabs should be dished out this autumn to the over-50s and other risk groups. The advisers have also called for senior citizens and those who are immunosuppressed to receive an extra booster dose this spring. These will be the seventh and eight jabs for thousands of Brits. The Mail has more.
Under the 2022 autumn Covid booster campaign which began in early September last year, over-50s, residents and staff at care homes for older adults and frontline health and social care workers are eligible for a jab.   
On top of these groups, five to 49 year-olds who are a clinical risk group, live with an immunosuppressed person or are carers have also been offered a booster – similar to that for the annual flu vaccine. 
According to the latest data, published on January 15th, 64.5% of those aged 50 and over and 82.4% of those aged 75 and over have received their [autumn] jab. 
In England, the closure of the autumn booster campaign and the first [spring] booster offer will be on February 12th. 
The JCVI also advised that the booster third dose which became available in 2021, will no longer be offered to those aged between 16 and 49-years-old who are not in a clinical risk group, from February 12th, “as the transition continues away from a pandemic emergency response towards pandemic recovery”.
Professor Wei Shen Lim, Chair of COVID-19 vaccination on the JCVI, said: “The COVID-19 vaccination programme continues to reduce severe disease across the population, while helping to protect the NHS.
“That is why we have advised planning for further booster vaccines for persons at higher risk of serious illness through an autumn booster programme later this year.”
She added: “We will very shortly also provide final advice on a spring booster programme for those at greatest risk.” …
The NHS will continue to operate a smaller scale vaccine offer from mid-February onwards to ensure those eligible for first and second doses can still get their jabs, it said today.
It comes as the FDA in the U.S. is set to recommend annual Covid boosters for Americans of all ages.

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_560835,"The COVID-19 pandemic wasn't all bad, a new Biden administration plan to fight climate change argues: It at least ""highlighted major opportunities"" to reduce travel demand and lower carbon emissions through ""remote work and virtual interactions.""

The plan—which President Joe Biden's Environmental Protection Agency and Energy, Transportation, and Housing departments released in January—aims to ""eliminate nearly all greenhouse gas emissions"" from the transportation sector by 2050, mostly through a transition to electric vehicles. Also included in the plan, however, is a controversial call to reduce ""commuting miles"" through ""an increase in remote work and virtual engagements,"" including in education.
""Telework and other components of a digital economy … can improve convenience by reducing travel demand, especially for work commuting,"" the plan states. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted major opportunities for telework, with some studies showing the possibility of 10 percent long-term reduction in annual vehicle miles traveled."" The plan goes on to identify ""remote access to services like health care and education"" as one of the ""key determinants of future travel demand.""
The administration's COVID-inspired call to reduce travel demand is certain to satisfy leading green energy groups, which have voiced similar rhetoric since the pandemic's onset. In April 2020, for example, the Rocky Mountain Institute touted ""opportunities to reduce vehicle miles traveled via telework."" But the plan is already prompting outrage among small business advocates, who point to the fact that more than 100,000 small businesses closed permanently during the first few months of the pandemic alone as owners dealt with decreased demand. For Job Creators Network president Alfredo Ortiz, that history would repeat itself if widespread telework was adopted in the name of climate change.
""Once again, the Biden administration is blindly pursuing a 'green' agenda despite the unintended consequences it poses to the economy and, more specifically, small businesses,"" Ortiz told the Washington Free Beacon. ""Small businesses struggled to survive the pandemic and we don't need to return to a similar environment in which in-person consumer demand is severely compromised.""
Even leading Democrats have echoed Ortiz's rhetoric. Just minutes into her third term as Washington, D.C., mayor, Democrat Muriel Bowser in early January pressed the White House to take ""decisive action"" to get federal workers back in their physical offices. While Biden promised in March that the ""vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person,"" he has so far failed to heed Bowser's call. D.C.'s office occupancy sat at just 45 percent before Christmas last year, according to Kastle Systems.
The Transportation and Housing departments did not return requests for comment. The emissions plan ""will be followed by more detailed sector-specific plans … to realize an improved and sustainable transportation future,"" according to a Jan. 10 Energy Department press release.

U.S. energy use declined to its lowest level in decades during the pandemic, a trend that also led to a 10 percent reduction in emissions. Travel has since ""largely returned to pre-pandemic levels,"" the Biden administration's January plan states, and U.S. carbon emissions subsequently rose last year. ""The pandemic has shown that rapid change can occur in both total transportation demand and how that demand is met,"" the plan notes.
Prominent climate change activists have long compared the issue to COVID. In an August 2020 blog post, liberal billionaire Bill Gates said that climate change ""could be worse"" than the pandemic and could one day make ""people afraid to leave home."""

In order to properly introduce Florida’s Governor during this tour, DeSantis Watch will be geofencing a one mile radius around the venues hosting these events with digital display ads highlighting what Ron’s actual blueprint for the country would be should he fulfill his relentless political ambitions.

On March 3, attendees at the Harris County GOP fundraiser will be educated on Ron’s support for cutting $473 billion from Medicare.

On March 4, dinner guests at the Dallas County Republican Party fundraiser will learn about how Ron voted to raise the retirement age to 70.

On March 5, those in Southern California hearing Ron speak at the Reagan Library will find out about how unlike the venue’s namesake, the Governor is weak on freedom at home and abroad following his recent flip-flop on aid for Ukraine and banning of books in Florida.

On March 9, folks gathering to hear Ron speak at the Alabama Republican Party will hear about how his fake populism as he serves the billionaires and corporate elites leads to higher costs at the expense of everyday people.

“As Ron DeSantis once again leaves Floridians behind to advance his own political ambitions, DeSantis Watch is proud to help introduce his out-of-touch and extreme record to a wider audience,” said DeSantis Watch Communications Director Anders Croy. “There is no greater threat to our freedoms than Ron DeSantis, a fake populist whose subservience to billionaires and the corporate elites will mean higher costs for you, cuts to Medicare and a shorter retirement with your family, and weakness in the face of Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_314258,"Scientists from around the world have united to stand up to the green agenda by exposing the so-called “climate crisis” as a hoax.

1609 scientists, including two Nobel laureates, gathered together to sign a declaration, proclaiming that “there is no climate emergency.”

The main goal is to end the mass climate hysteria and the destruction this clamor brings to the U.S. economy.

“There is no climate emergency,” the document signed by Nobel prize recipients John F. Clauser from the U.S. and Ivar Giaever from Norway/U.S. and the others emphasized.

“Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm.

“We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero [carbon dioxide] CO2 policy proposed for 2050.

“Go for adaptation instead of mitigation; adaptation works whatever the causes are.”

They also note that climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific.

According to them, scientists should openly address uncertainties and exaggerations in the predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of their policy measures.

The proclamation also pointed out that Earth is undergoing cold and warm phases and they are natural phenomena and the gap between the real and modeled world tells us that we are far from understanding climate change:

“The geological archive reveals that Earth’s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed, with natural cold and warm phases.

“The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850.

“Therefore, it is no surprise that we now are experiencing a period of warming,” adding that warming is even far slower than what was predicted on the basis of modeled anthropogenic or human activity forcing.

Lately, climate alarmists and globalists are also pushing for CO2 emission reduction, even resorting to measures of taxing animals’ burps and farts just to make sure CO2 is reduced.

However, the scientists dispelled this narrative:

“CO2 is not a pollutant.

“It is essential to all life on Earth.

“More CO2 is favorable for nature, greening our planet.

“Additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass.

“It is also profitable for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide.”

They do not only exaggerate the effect of greenhouse gases but they also ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial.

In fact, as per the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), when trees absorb and store CO2 in their fibers, it helps to clean the air.

According to the Arbor Day Foundation, a mature tree absorbs more than 48 pounds of CO2 from the atmosphere in one year and releases oxygen in exchange.

“So, you’d actually want more trees,” award-winning investigative reporter Joshua Philipp pointed out during an episode of EpochTV‘s “Crossroads.”

“If you actually believe the climate change narrative, you’d actually think that the solution is to plant more trees.”

Additionally, the declaration highlighted how global warming has not increased natural disasters as there has not been any statistical evidence that it is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts, or other such natural disasters, or making them more frequent.

Meanwhile, there is ample evidence that CO2 mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly.

Professor Steven Koonin, former Undersecretary for Science at the U.S. Department of Energy and author of the 2021 bestseller, “Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t and Why It Matters,” said in his book that what the largely unreadable (for laymen) and complicated science reports say on climate change is completely distorted by the time their contents are filtered through a long line of summary reports of the research by the media and the politicians.

“There are abundant opportunities to get things wrong – both accidentally and on purpose – as the information goes through filter after filter to be packaged for various audiences… It’s not only the public that is ill-informed about what the science says about climate,” he said, detailing how the government and UN press releases do not accurately reflect the reports themselves.

“Distinguished climate experts (including report authors themselves) are embarrassed by some media portrayals of the science,” he further stated.

During an “Uncommon Knowledge” interview with Peter Robinson, Koonin revealed that his colleagues’ reactions to his book were that he should not be telling the public or the politicians the truth about climate change.

“I was taught that you tell the whole truth [as a scientist]. And you let the politicians make the value judgments and the cost-effectiveness trade-offs and so on,” Koonin said.

He noted as well the immorality of asking the developing world to cut down emissions when so many do not even have access to electricity and the immorality of scaring the younger generations: 84 percent of American teenagers believe, as of January 2022, that if climate change is not addressed, “it will be too late for future generations, making some part of the planet unlivable.”

In March, the White House released a report “undermining any claims of an ongoing climate crisis or imminent catastrophe,” Koonin wrote in July.

“The report’s authors should be commended for honestly delivering likely unwelcome messages, even if they didn’t make a show of it.

“The rest of the Biden administration and its climate-activist allies should moderate their apocalyptic rhetoric and cancel the climate crisis accordingly.

“Exaggerating the magnitude, urgency, and certainty of the climate threat encourages ill-considered policies that could be more disruptive and expensive than any change in the climate itself.”

However, President Joe Biden continues with his radical policies and fearmongering.

“I don’t think anybody can deny the impact of the climate crisis anymore,” he said, commenting on Hurricane Idalia on August 30.

“Just look around. Historic floods. I mean, historic floods.

“More intense droughts, extreme heat, and significant wildfires have caused significant damage.”"

The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan was a shameful betrayal and an embarrassment.

More importantly, we lost 13 American service members, deserted hundreds of US citizens, and thousands of allies who had risked their lives for our country and our troops.

Our retreat emboldened foreign adversaries to become more aggressive – and our allies have paid the price. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has stretched on for two years and cost hundreds of billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian lives.

Could Gavin Newsom and California's liberal trucking laws  be the blame ? 😛
The NEWS says the California port situation is caused by a driver shortage. 
Not so fast: It is in part caused by a California Truck Ban which says all trucks must be 2011 or newer and a law called AB 5 which prohibits Owner Operators. 
Traditionally the ports have been served by Owner Operators (non union).  California has now banned Owner Operators. 
Long term, truckers in California are not investing in new trucks because California has a law that makes them illegal in 2035.  The requirement is to purchase electric trucks which do not exist.

Politifact_Mostly False_Social media_304910,"Hobby Lobby, We may close
By David Green, the founder and CEO of Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. 
When my family and I started our company 40 years ago, we were working out of a garage on a $600 bank loan, assembling miniature picture frames. Our first retail store wasn't much bigger than most people's living rooms, but we had faith that we would succeed if we lived and worked according to God's word. From there, Hobby Lobby has become one of the nation's largest arts and crafts retailers, with more than 500 locations in 41 states. Our children grew up into fine business leaders, and today we run Hobby Lobby together, as a family. 
We're Christians, and we run our business on Christian principles. I've always said that the first two goals of our business are (1) to run our business in harmony with God's laws, and (2) to focus on people more than money. And that's what we've tried to d o. We close early so our employees can see their families at night. We keep our stores closed on Sundays, one of the week's biggest shopping days, so that our workers and their families can enjoy a day of rest. We believe that it is by God's grace that Hobby Lobby has endured, and he has blessed us and our employees. We've not only added jobs in a weak economy, we've raised wages for the past four years in a row. Our full-time employees start at 80% above minimum wage. 
But now, our government threatens to change all of that. A new government healthcare mandate says that our family business MUST provide what I believe are abortion-causing drugs as part of our health insurance. Being Christians, we don't pay for drugs tha t might cause abortions, which means that we don't cover emergency contraception, the morning-after pill or the week-after pill. We believe doing so might end a life after the moment of conception, something that is contrary to our most important beliefs. It goes against the Biblical principles on which we have run this company since day one. 
If we refuse to comply, we could face $1.3 million PER DAY in government fines. Our government threatens to fine job creators in a bad economy. Our government threatens to fine a company that's raised wages four years running. Our government threatens to fine a family for running its business according to its beliefs. It's not right. I know people will say we ought to follow the rules; that it's the same for everybod y. 
But that's not true. The government has exempted thousands of companies from this mandate, for reasons of convenience or cost. But it won't exempt them for reasons of religious belief. So, Hobby Lobby and my family are forced to make a choice. With great reluctance, we filed a lawsuit today, represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, asking a federal court to stop this mandate before it hurts our business. We don't like to go running into court, but we no longer have a choice. We believe people are more important than the bottom line and that honoring God is more important than turning a profit. 
My family has lived the American dream. We want to continue growing our company and providing great jobs for thousands of employees, but the government is going to make that much more difficult. The government is forcing us to choose between following our faith and following the law. I say that's a choice no American and no American business should have to make. 
The government cannot force you to follow laws that go against your fundamental religious belief. They have exempted thousands of companies but will not exempt Christian organizations including the Catholic Church. 
Since you will not see this in the liberal media, please pass this on to all your contacts. 
Sincerely, 
David Green 
CEO and Founder of Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc."

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_619316,"Taxpayer subsidies paid to wind and solar developers contributed to the grid nearing emergency conditions this week, according to an oil and gas expert.

“That's part of it,” Robert Bradley, CEO and founder of the Institute for Energy Research, said. “We get a lot of generation we don't need just because the tax breaks are so great, and when you keep adding the so-called unreliables, it’s at the expense of the reliables. They're the most expensive to build but the least expensive to dispatch.” 

Other than mild weather and normally scheduled or expected outages, April 13, was a normal day until Texas' grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, sent an appeal for Texans to conserve electricity use because of allegedly near emergency conditions, according to media reports.


Robert Bradley, CEO and founder of the Institute for Energy Research | Provided
“Conventional generators are very thin right now because Texas has gone to so many renewables,” Bradley told the Houston Republic. “The way the pricing is set up, renewables are advantaged and baseload generation is not. So, we haven't had much new capacity with the baseload generators, which gets back to government policy, forced renewables and de-carbonization of the grid.”

According to ERCOT system conditions data, the wind hit its peak generation of almost 17,000 MW the next day on April 13 at 1 a.m. Wind generation subsequently dropped to about 5,000 MW during the daily periods of regular increased demand. Even the 5,000 MW, wind generation for April 13 was 3,000 MW less than what was forecasted.

“We need a lot less wind and a lot more natural gas and even coal,” Bradley said in an interview. “There have been coal retirements and some of those ought to probably come back for the summer. Texas has reached the limit of our renewable dependence. There certainly should not be any more wind or solar for the grid.” 

In addition to lagging wind generation, the Texas Tribune reports that solar generation was also unavailable as it also failed to reach projected output to the grid due to cloudy weather.

“During the day, there are a lot of clouds, which is another variable,” Bradley said. “It was a worst-case scenario for renewables and this can happen at any time, which puts Texas at the mercy of wind and clouds, not only just cold and heat.”

This is not a new phenomenon. As previously reported in the Houston Republic, recent winter storms exposed the danger of energy policies that make the state too dependent on wind and solar energy and the extreme cold and snow caused the wind turbines to freeze, leading to power outages across the state during a time of overwhelming demand for energy. 

“The big problem is that wind had an indirect effect and all the favoritism toward wind has ruined the economics of baseload generation,” Bradley said. “These independent generators can't just depend on emergencies where they get an astronomical price for generation because banks won't lend money on that. They need something more stable, and wind doesn't allow you to do that.”

Texas Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian recently told the Austin News that the reliability issue isn't so much the existence of renewable energy, but that it has displaced reliable generation because they have been prioritized and subsidized by tax dollars. 

However, Bradley foresees that it’s not just tax dollars, but also ERCOT’s policy of accepting electricity with bids based on marginal costs.

“The marginal cost of wind and solar is so small that they'll always win because they don't have fuel costs,” he said. “You have these generation sources where on an average cost basis, they're more expensive, but on a marginal or incremental cost basis, they're the cheapest. They always get bid in but the rates are so low that the conventional generators don't make money.”

According to a report from America's Power, through 2018, renewable energy resources — primarily wind and solar — have received subsidies amounting to more than $100 billion.

Charles McConnell, the executive director of the Center for Carbon Management in Energy and Sustainability at the University of Houston, previously told the Houston Republic that Chapter 313 subsidies are one of several tools that Texas uses to ""encourage the investments and the deployment of renewables – both wind and solar."" He points out that the way renewables often operate means that they would not be profitable without government subsidies and other handouts. 

As a result, Texas' reserve margin has dramatically decreased due to the subsidizing of renewable energy projects.

“They're turning an energy-rich state into an energy-poor state is what all this government intervention is doing,” Bradley said. “At the state level, it’s just bad policy but it's also due to federal incentives, such as the production tax credit.”"

THE SHRINKING AARP IS LOSING PLENTY OF SENIORS .
The lady who wrote this letter below not only has a grasp of the situation, but also an incredible command of the English language. Her letter was sent to Mr. Rand who is the Executive Director of AARP. It only takes a few days on the Internet and this message will have reached 75% of the public in the U.S.A.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Mr. Rand,
Recently you sent us a letter encouraging us to renew our lapsed membership in AARP by the requested date. This isn't what you were looking for, but it is the most honest response I can give you.  Our coverage gap is a microscopic symptom of the real problem, a deepening lack of faith.  While we have proudly maintained our membership for years and long admired the AARP goals and principles, regrettably, we can no longer endorse its abdication of our values.  Your letter stated that we can count on AARP to speak up for our rights, yet the voice we hear is not ours!
Your offer of being kept up to date on important issues through DIVIDED WE FAIL presents neither an impartial view nor the one we have come to embrace.  We do believe that when two parties agree all the time on everything presented to them, one is probably not necessary. But, when the opinions and long term goals are diametrically opposed, the divorce is imminent.  This is the philosophy which spawned our 200 years of government.
Once upon a time, we looked forward to being part of the senior demographic.  We also looked to AARP to provide certain benefits and give our voice a power we could not possibly hope to achieve on our own.  AARP once gave us a sense of belonging which we no longer enjoy. The Socialist politics practiced by the Biden Regime and empowered by AARP serves only to raise the blood pressure my medical insurance strives to contain.  Clearly a conflict of interest there!  We do not understand the AARP posture, feel greatly betrayed by the guiding forces that we expected to map out our senior years and leave your ranks with a great sense of regret.  We mitigate that disappointment with the relief of knowing that we are not contributing to the problem anymore by renewing our membership.  There are numerous other organizations which offer discounts without threatening our way of life or offending our sensibilities and values.
This Biden Regime scares the living daylights out of us.  Not just for ourselves, but for our proud and bloodstained heritage.  But more importantly for our children and grandchildren.  Washington has rendered Soylent Green a prophetic cautionary tale rather than a nonfiction scare tactic.  I have never endorsed any militant or radical groups, yet now I find myself listening to them.  I don't have to agree with them to appreciate the fear which birthed their existence.  Their borderline insanity presents little more than a balance to the voice of the Socialist Mindset in power.  Perhaps I became American by a great stroke of luck in some cosmic uterine lottery, but in my adulthood I CHOOSE to embrace it and nurture the freedoms it represents as well as the responsibilities.  Your web site generously offers us the opportunity to receive all communication in Spanish.  ARE YOU KIDDING???  The illegal perpetrators have broken into our 'house', invaded our home without  invitation or consent.  The President insists we keep these illegal perpetrators in comfort and learn the perpetrator's language so we can communicate our reluctant welcome to them.  I DON'T choose to welcome them, to support them, to educate them, to medicate them, or to pay for their food or clothing.  American home invaders get arrested.  Please explain to me why foreign lawbreakers can enjoy privileges on American soil that Americans do not get?  Why do some immigrants have to play the game to be welcomed and others only have to break and enter to be welcomed?  We travel for a living.  Walt hauls horses all over this great country, averaging over 10,000 miles a month when he is out there. He meets more people than a politician on caffeine overdose.  Of all the many good folks he enjoyed on this last 10,000 miles, this trip
yielded only ONE supporter of the current Regime.  One of us is out of touch with mainstream America .  Since our poll is conducted without funding, I have more faith in it than ones that are driven by a need to yield AMNESTY (aka-make voters out of the foreign lawbreakers so they can vote to continue the governments free handouts).  This addition of 10 to 20 million voters who then will vote to continue Socialism will OVERWHELM our votes to control the government's free handouts.  It is a ""slippery slope"" we must not embark on! As Margaret Thatcher (former Prime Minister of Great Britain ) once said      ""Socialism is GREAT - UNTIL you run out of other people's money"".
We have decided to forward this to everyone on our mailing list, and will encourage them to do the same.  With several hundred in my address book, I have every faith that the eventual exponential factor will make a credible statement to you.  I am disappointed as all get out!   I am more scared than I have ever been in my entire life!  I am ANGRY!  I am MAD as heck, and I'm NOT gonna take it anymore!

 Judge Jackson says, in writing, she doesn’t believe that everyone who collects child pornography is a pedophile.

Politifact_Mostly False_News and blog_111406,"Face masks may raise the risk of stillbirths, testicular dysfunction and cognitive decline in children, an 'explosive' new study has claimed.

Authors of a review of dozens of studies on face coverings suggested they can cause mild carbon dioxide poisoning when worn over long periods.

The German academics who carried out the research believe masks create a pocket of dead space between the mouth and mask, which traps the toxic gas.

They say the build-up of CO2 in pregnant women's bodies could cause complications for the unborn fetus. They point out that CO2 also contributes to oxidative stress, which can affect cognition and cause testicular issues in men.

But independent doctors have questioned the conclusions of the study — which never directly looked at health complications and mask use, describing the link as 'unlikely'.

One study the German researchers looked at found that just 0.3 percent prolonged CO2 exposure to both pregnant rats and young mice led to brain damage, heightened anxiety and poorer memory. Another found that male mice exposed to 2.5 percent CO2 for four hours — equal to 0.5 percent for humans — resulted in the destruction of testicular cells and sperm. A third study found that three percent CO2 (equivalent of 0.8 percent for humans) in pregnant rats caused stillbirth and birth defects

Alluding to the surge in stillbirths during the pandemic, the German researchers said: 'Circumstantial evidence exists that popular mask use may be related to current observations of a significant rise of 28 percent to 33 percent in stillbirths worldwide.'

'[And] reduced verbal, motor, and overall cognitive performance of two full standard deviations in scores in children born during the pandemic,' the researchers wrote in the paper, published in the journal Heliyon.

But the study could not conclusively prove that the masks were directly responsible for any of these complications.

Dr Stuart Fischer, an emergency care physician in New York, questioned whether there was a 'toxic buildup' of CO2. 

He said: 'I wouldn’t say this happens, because the body adjusts the pH, the acid/base balance very quickly. Respiratory acidosis due to facemasks is unlikely although short-term side effects might affect people with chronic lung disease.'

The German research team gathered data from 43 previously published studies on exposure to CO2, mask-wearing and pregnancy.

They found that after wearing a mask for more than five minutes, CO2 levels in the inhaled air rose to between 1.4 percent and 3.2 percent.

One mask study conducted in Germany, researchers measured the CO2 concentration of air behind surgical masks worn by 15 healthy men. Within 30 minutes, the CO2 concentration rose to roughly 2.8-3.2 percent.

In another study in Italy, scientists measured the air under surgical masks worn in a lab and found a concentration between 0.22 and 0.29 percent within five minutes. 

Masks provide breathing resistance and create a dead space that traps CO2, leading to more inhaled and re-breathed CO2, the reviewers said.

The gas makes up around 0.04 percent of all inhaled air, for comparison, and the  Department of Agriculture said safe levels should be below 0.5 percent for eight-hour exposure.

One study found that exposure to 0.48 percent CO2 for 10 minutes daily for 20 days in pregnant guinea pigs led to stillbirth and birth defects in 68 percent of pups

The researchers then looked at studies that focused on the effect of similar CO2 levels on animals such as mice and rats.

Mammals such as mice and rats with prolonged exposed to 0.3 percent carbon dioxide gave birth to offspring which had 'irreversible neuron damage', the review found.

In total, the researchers looked at studies dating back from the start of the scientific databases they searched until November 30, 2021. 

The main caveat of the research is that the studies looking at the potential toxic effects of carbon dioxide are animal studies - because these experiments would not be ethical in humans. 

The researchers also noted that none of the studies in their review looked directly at mask use and miscarriages, infertility and neurodevelopment disorders.

The researchers also noted that the exact effects of toxic levels of CO2 on unborn life is not known in great detail.

Carbon dioxide is known to contribute to oxidative stress, which the researchers suggested would hinder fetal development. 

Dr Kevin Bass, cell and molecular biology PhD student, said on Twitter that the new paper was 'explosive'.

But he said: 'We do not have any good evidence in pregnant women... of the long-term effects of mask-wearing and therefore no evidence that these effects occur in women.'

He added: 'All we have are animal studies and a clear indication that changes in CO2 concentrations do occur in mask-wearing women.'

Stillbirths and pregnancy complications rose during the Covid pandemic, and preeclampsia and other pregnancy complications were blamed on the virus.

Factors other than mask-wearing are likely to be at play, such as hospital closures and delayed care. 

It comes after three years of fierce debate about the effectiveness of masks.

The biggest review by the Cochrane Institute, the 'gold standard' of evidence-based reviews, based in London, found they made little to no difference to infections but smaller studies suggest there is a lower risk of catching Covid.

Mask mandates on transportation systems in America were backed by penalties of up to $3,000 for repeat offenders.

Former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr Anthony Fauci initially advised people not to wear masks, which he later claimed because he was concerned there would not be enough for healthcare workers.

He went on to advise that everyone should wear a mask."

Dead whales are washing up on the Jersey shore in record numbers, and so far there’s one very curious possible cause: green energy.

They’re building large scale wind farms off the East Coast — conducting underwater surveys before construction. They’re using pulses of low frequency sound beneath the ocean’s surface.

It happens to be the same sound frequency that whales use to hear and communicate — what a weird coincidence. Oh they must not have known ? Right. Because no one noticed those hundreds of whales killed Back in 2008 by Exxon off the coast of Madagascar while conducting oil mapping surveys using the same sonar technology.

Politifact_Mostly False_Social media_239043,"⁉ Bloomberg Says he wants to Ban Guns Holding More Than 3 Rounds
From 1994-2004 we had an assault weapon ban and guess what it did, absolutely nothing. 
The National Institute of Justice stated, “There has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence”. 
There were 16 Mass shootings while the assault weapon ban was in effect. For crying out loud, the Columbine High School Massacre happened during the assault weapons ban. 
The law wasn’t flawed, it was pointless. We have over 20 million AR-15s in this country! 
Do you think you’re going to make 20 million guns disappear just because you passed a law? Not to mention AR15’s, which are not Assault weapons, make up less than 1% of gun deaths in this country. 
The law did nothing then and it will do nothing now. A blind monkey can see that. 
The man who has dedicated his life and  campaign to ban ""assault weapons"", spent millions on organizations to ban ""assault weapons"", Spent millions on politicians to ban “assault weapons”, spent millions on advertisements to ban “assault weapons”, spent millions on biased research and polls to ban “assault weapons”, but  when asked to define what an “assault weapon” is he says, “Anything that you can shoot really quickly”.
What does that even mean? 
That’s like calling any car that you can drive really quickly an assault vehicle.
10 million dollars spent on one anti-gun ad and this lunatic can’t even define what it is he wants to ban, this is insane. 
What Michael Bloomberg just told every American is that if you can’t stop someone from killing you with three rounds, you deserve to die. 
This, on national television the man who is running to be the president of the United States of America. 
The same country that shot at a King because in part tried to take our guns. The same country that when enumerating the most important rights a human being can have listed the right to bear arms as NUMBER 2. 
This self-righteous, power-hungry, megalomaniac, basically said, that if you can’t stop someone from trying to kill you with three rounds, you deserve to die. Are you kidding me! 
This man has armed security everywhere he goes but he’s telling you and me that having a gun to fight off a criminal is stupid. 
He not only doesn’t believe in firearm ownership; he doesn’t believe in self-defense. 
He does for himself, but you, the little peon citizen, oh no, you don’t get self-defense because that’s stupid, why would want to stop someone from killing you. 
Keep in mind he didn’t refute the fact that criminals would still have guns, he just said that you’re more likely to shoot someone else with it. 
He thinks everyone but he and his elite friends are stupid and need to be saved from themselves. Yet he walks around with personal armed security. This is hypocrisy on a level never before seen by man. 
This is who Bloomberg really is. 
He lives in a billionaire bubble where no one questions him, no one challenges any of his ideas, and he has so much money he can get a lot of people to do and say whatever he wants. 
None of these questions were out of line or outrageous. 
They were normal thought-provoking questions about an incredibly important issue and the mere fact that his idea on the issue was challenged just a little bit enraged him to the point that he couldn’t do anything but call the ideas stupid.

“From the moment we started talking I realized she was a potential star,” Ben Domenech, the publisher of The Federalist, said in an essay on Saturday. “She was raw, yes, but that could be honed. She was eager to learn, to write, and to go places—not because of ambition, but because she wanted to change the world.”

She seemed unafraid to take on things that mattered, including breaking the hard-hitting piece DOJ Destroyed Missing Strzok/Page Text Messages Before The IG Could Review Them on December 13th, where, unlike the mainstream media who later focused on the idea that there was ‘no evidence’ that these text messages were deliberately destroyed, Payton leaned towards the conclusion that there was criminal intent in these deletions, a notion supported by Donald Trump.

And then she died suddenly on Friday in San Diego. She was 26.

I don’t have any definitive ‘proof’ for the notion that Payton was killed because she was going to disclose some type of sensitive information against the Deep State; however, it must be said that the cause and circumstances of her death are befuddling enough for one to consider such an idea.

She immediately called 911 and Bre was taken to the hospital where she was admitted to the ICU, sedated & intubated, and doctors began working up a diagnosis. After a CT scan and hours of testing, they have determined she has the H1N1 flu and meningitis. George stayed at the hospital with her in San Diego for a long time,  but her condition worsened and worsened.

She fought her illness with strength but, passed on December 28th, 2018. She will be survived by her four siblings and parents.  She fought strong and lived a life worth noting in the books. We are so incredibly honored to have known this wonderful human being.

Something Just Doesn’t Seem Right

Trying to put some pieces together here, Morgan Murtaugh never mentioned noticing anything wrong with Bre on Wednesday night, so we are left to assume that a healthy, vibrant 26-year old girl became fully incapacitated during a nights sleep without showing any prior symptoms, and then was dead 24 hours later, with doctors saying that she had the Swine Flu (H1N1) and  meningitis. Surprisingly, a New York Times obituary for Bre Payton said that ‘Ms. Payton had the H1N1 flu, also known as the swine flu, and encephalitis, according to her family.’ So, is it encephalitis or meningitis? And what is the actual cause of her death, one of these ailments or the H1N1 flu? I have not found an answer to this.

While the cause of death does not seem to have been determined, several mainstream media outlets are taking the opportunity to use this to subtly warn people that they should remember to take their flu vaccine, which includes an H1N1 component. The way mainstream media writes about this story is to ask how she died, mention and go into depth about the diagnosis and the history of the H1N1 virus, talk a little about her life, and then leave the initial question unanswered. They sway the typical mainstream reader to believe she died of the H1N1 virus without really saying it.

Some hypothesize that Bre Payton might have actually taken the flu shot and that led to her illness. But this tweet from her a few years back makes it highly unlikely that she would consent to any vaccine:

I don’t know enough to say it’s impossible that Bre Payton died so suddenly from a virus she had contracted naturally without any prior symptoms, but it just doesn’t feel right. You would expect that she would have some pretty significant symptoms in the days prior. Add that to the fact that we have covered many stories of people who have died mysterious deaths who all happened to be courageous, outspoken people who were willing to challenge the establishment, and might have had some information that was damaging to the Deep State and were willing to reveal it, as she showed in breaking the Mueller story, you can begin to understand the suspicions.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_140780,"George Soros was said arrested in Switzerland at 13:23 GMT on Feb. 3 2019. Evidently members of what was known as the Alliance stormed his retreat at Saint Margrethenberg, Switzerland based on a tip from local police. The Alliance was a military force working under orders of the Pentagon, GITMO Military Tribunal Judges and in conjunction with legal entities across the globe.

Soros has been suspected to illegally influence US elections over the years, was thought behind thousands of immigrants forcing their way across the US Border, his organizations were believed to own and control software used in state voting machines and even worse, the multi billionaire was known to be a leader in the Vatican’s Ninth Circle Satanic Cult. He was thought behind regularly scheduled Satanic Child Sacrifice Rites and Human Hunting Parties organized under the Vatican and involving children and kidnapped teens across the globe according to Kevin Annette of ITCCS (www.itccs.org).

Vatican, Clinton, Soros, Global Elites Named in Child Rape, Homicides

Evidently the Alliance had enough evidence supplied by former US President Barak Obama and other informants at GITMO to arrest Soros. Obama was believed to have been incarcerated at GITMO for at least a month, exposing crimes of upper echelons of the Deep State to save his own skin. Obama was thought to have been charged with High Treason for multiple crimes including Uranium One and the Benghazi massacre.

Believed to be in poor health Soros was reported to have been prevented from committing suicide with a cyanide pill prior to capture. Presently he was thought to be under interrogation at a bunker near Gasternal, Switzerland.

J. Christian Adams, a former DOJ attorney under the Obama administration who was now president of Public Interest Legal Foundation, once told Fox News that Soros had Obama’s Department of Justice at his beck and call. “Soros’ organizations in the U.S. were instrumental in shaping DOJ policy under the Obama administration,” Adams said, noting allegations that Soros was involved in police procedures and voter ID rules across the nation. “Americans do not understand the extent to which Soros fuels this anti-constitutional, anti-American agenda.”

As far as Soros’ involvement in the international child exploitation ring run by the Vatican: back on 16 August 2014 human sacrifices of two children on a blood stained altar was interrupted by police and an ITCCS team in an upscale neighborhood in Outremont Montreal Quebec, Canada. The Satanic rite was believed organized by George Soros and executives of Sinclair Oil and Cargill Corporation. The children were said to be held at McGill University, site of CIA 1940s to 1960s MKULTRA tortuous experiments on children.

Cult Arrested with Caged Abused Babies and Body Parts Released Without Charges

A few years ago in just one ITCCS raid on the Soros/Vatican Ninth Circle they found sexually abused, beaten and starved babies and children, all below age six, in small padlocked cages among frozen body parts of prior victims. Raids by ITCCS teams and local police had also disrupted Satanic Ninth Circle Child Sacrifice rites at Catholic facilities in Zwolle Holland, Dijon France and Lucerne Switzerland.

Documents found at Soros’ retreat revealed the locations of Cabal underground bases from Ireland to Croatia, as well as a new type of CERN quantum machine. Alliance sources revealed that this was their technology stolen back in 2007."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_240409,"With all the talk of whistleblowers in the media lately, it’s an opportune time to take a look at what it actually means to “blow the whistle” from within the federal government. The Obama administration dealt with leakers quite harshly, so they were able to control what got out about the numerous scandals. In fact, the Obama administration prosecuted more leakers under the Espionage Act for leaking than all other administrations put together. By contrast, today leakers of fourth-hand hearsay in the Trump administration are heralded by the left as meritorious whistleblowers.

The Obama administration found it much easier to fire people suspected of disloyalty without the bulk of the media raising any issue at all. The Obama administration was vicious in even spying on reporters, as we learned about their surveillance of not just a Fox News reporter but also even the Associated Press. Not even a whimper was heard from the “mainstream” over those abuses. They just lined up and said, ‘Thank you sir, may I have another.’

What we’re seeing now does not qualify for whistleblower status, but instead is more like anonymous newly legalized leaking of classified materials through multiple levels of hearsay for political purposes to harm a duly-elected President and his ability to perform his job. As we have learned, the Intel Inspector General (IG) changed the rule after the complaint was known in order to allow hearsay complaints, but the IG dishonestly backdated the rule change so that damage could be done to President Trump. We now need an IG investigation of the Intel IG. (RELATED: The President Is About To Get CNN Legally Designated As Fake News)


WASHINGTON, DC – OCTOBER 04: Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT) speaks to the media after leaving a closed door briefing with Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson before the House Intelligence Committee on October 4, 2019 in Washington, DC. Atkinson is on the Hill to discuss a whistleblower complaint regarding a phone conversation between President Donald Trump and a foreign leader. (Photo by Pete Marovich/Getty Images)

In a just and fair nation, actual whistleblowers are people who disclose first-hand evidence that they reasonably believe is evidence of illegality, such as fraud or wasteful spending. Properly reporting the abuse of government resources and providing hard evidence of the abuse is essential to good governance in our country. A hearsay-spreading gossip is in no way a laudable whistleblower. Instead, someone so power-hungry and manipulative invites fraudulent and politically-biased claims, exactly like we are currently witnessing.

Whistleblower laws were meant to protect federal employees from losing their jobs as payback for these factual disclosures when their identity was revealed. If the identity of a legitimate whistleblower with firsthand knowledge is going to be kept secret, there is no need for whistleblower laws to protect them from reprisals.  This is especially true in the intelligence community where whistleblowers risk having their security clearance revoked without due process or just cause. In some cases, reporting misconduct can even cost them their career and livelihood by these means. (RELATED: Gohmert: Inspector General Glosses Over Some Ugly Truths About The FBI)

As far as what happens to legitimate whistleblowers, one need look no further than the case of Adam Lovinger, a Trump-supporting strategic affairs analyst who worked for the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment (ONA). Mr. Lovinger became concerned that the Pentagon was wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on outside contractors commissioned to write academic-style papers instead of authentic net assessments of future threats. Although the sole mission of ONA was to create these net assessments, it had not produced a net assessment in over a decade, relegating the duties of its staff to outside contractors. The amount of the questionable payments under these contracts were well outside of the norm for ONA subject matter experts for such assessments, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars more.


One of the recipient contractors in this scheme that Lovinger identified was an obscure college professor, a man the world would later learn was one of the key players in the coup attempt against then-candidate Donald J. Trump: Stefan Halper. Mr. Lovinger had no idea he had just stepped on a landmine, when all he did was discern outrageously wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars. (RELATED: It’s Looking More And More Like The Whistleblower Issue Was Stage-Managed By Dems And The CIA)

Rather than leaking classified information to the press, as certain politically motivated disinformation operatives would do while claiming to be a “whistleblower,” Mr. Lovinger alerted his chain of command inside the Pentagon through a series of internal emails. Despite exercising the proper reporting channels, Mr. Lovinger would eventually be stripped of his security clearance, leaving him virtually unemployable in the areas of his expertise. Over two and a half years later he remains suspended without pay and without his security clearance as the bureaucrats continue their coverup for bad actors in the Obama administration who weaponized the security clearance process.

Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced a formal impeachment inquiry due to a whistleblower complaint regarding the call. (Photo Illustration by Alex Wong/Getty Images)
This egregious retaliatory action was why I first drafted the Adam S. Lovinger Whistleblower Reprisal Act in 2018. If enacted, this bill would make it a federal crime to use background checks as a political weapon in an effort to curb the largely unpunished trend of officials in Washington. These swamp-dwelling insider trolls have leveraged security clearances against potential whistleblowers who would otherwise report instances of corruption in the federal government.



Democrats in Congress and their willing accomplices in the media have given little to no coverage of Mr. Lovinger’s fact-filled, document-driven, honorable report. Contrast that with the way those same leftists have glorified the anonymous, malevolent gossiper and it reveals how self-serving their motivations truly are. Rather than protecting brave individuals who come forward with legitimate reports of government misconduct and malfeasance, like Mr. Lovinger, the Democrats instead choose to champion a politically expedient non-factual hearsay account to prop up their ongoing anti-Trump narrative. (RELATED: BARR: Intelligence Community Management Is Behind ‘Whistleblower’ Saboteurs)

When this type of flagrant bias is permitted, our nation’s whistleblowing mechanisms are corrupted and weaponized as we are seeing now with anonymous, hearsay accusations. Whistleblowers are supposed to identify themselves, testify, and provide documentation of wrongdoing. The current, third-world-style politics on display now was ramped up to new levels by the Obama Administration which has deeply divided this nation. The hatred is not coming from conservatives who want to keep our republic. Instead, it is seething anger that blinds the left into decreeing that there is no room for different views from their own. Some Trump-hating elitists need to awaken from their angry stupor, and allow America to once again be a place where hope blossoms and the third world has an example of justice to which they can aspire.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_322538,"The State of Virginia, now entirely run by truly insane Democrats who support infanticide and child murder, is proposing a new 2020 law known as SB64 (see link here) which will be taken up by the Democrat-run Senate beginning January 8, 2020.

The law would instantly transform all martial arts instructors into criminal felons. This includes instructors who teach kickboxing, BJJ, Krav Maga, boxing and even Capoeira.

It would also criminalize all firearms training classes, including concealed carry classes.

It would even criminalize a father teaching his own son how to use a hunting rifle.

Specifically, the law says that a person “is guilty of unlawful paramilitary activity” (a class 5 felony) if that person:

“Assembles with one or more persons for the purpose of training with, practicing with, or being instructed in the use of any firearm, explosive, or incendiary device, or technique capable of causing injury or death to persons…”

The phrase “technique capable of causing injury or death to persons” covers all forms of martial arts and self-defense training, including Krav Maga, BJJ, boxing and other contact martial arts such as Tae Kwon Do or Tai Chi.

Under the proposed law, all forms of self-defense training — including hand-to-hand martial arts training — would be considered “paramilitary activity,” even if the training consists of private classes involving just one instructor and one student. That’s because every form of martial arts training imparts skills which could be used to cause injury to other persons.

In fact, according to the language of the law, just “one” person learning such arts is a felony crime, which means that watching a DVD on Krav Maga would be a felony crime.

Here is the full text of the proposed law:

SENATE BILL NO. 64
Offered January 8, 2020
Prefiled November 21, 2019
A BILL to amend and reenact §18.2-433.2 of the Code of Virginia, relating to paramilitary activities; penalty.

Bill Title: Paramilitary activities; penalty.
Spectrum: Partisan Bill (Democrat 1-0)
Status: (Introduced) 2019-11-21 – Referred to Committee for Courts of Justice

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia:

1. That §18.2-433.2 of the Code of Virginia is amended and reenacted as follows:

§18.2-433.2. Paramilitary activity prohibited; penalty.

A person shall be is guilty of unlawful paramilitary activity, punishable as a Class 5 felony if he:

1. Teaches or demonstrates to any other person the use, application, or making of any firearm, explosive, or incendiary device, or technique capable of causing injury or death to persons, knowing or having reason to know or intending that such training will be employed for use in, or in furtherance of, a civil disorder; or

2. Assembles with one or more persons for the purpose of training with, practicing with, or being instructed in the use of any firearm, explosive, or incendiary device, or technique capable of causing injury or death to persons, intending to employ such training for use in, or in furtherance of, a civil disorder; or

3. Assembles with one or more persons with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons by drilling, parading, or marching with any firearm, any explosive or incendiary device, or any components or combination thereof.

2. That the provisions of this act may result in a net increase in periods of imprisonment or commitment. Pursuant to §30-19.1:4 of the Code of Virginia, the estimated amount of the necessary appropriation cannot be determined for periods of imprisonment in state adult correctional facilities; therefore, Chapter 854 of the Acts of Assembly of 2019 requires the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission to assign a minimum fiscal impact of $50,000. Pursuant to §30-19.1:4 of the Code of Virginia, the estimated amount of the necessary appropriation cannot be determined for periods of commitment to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice.

The text of the law, reprinted above, is word-for-word accurate from Legiscan.com as of the publication date of this article. Treasonous Virginia Democrats don’t want you to know the truth about the tyranny they are about to roll out, probably with a secret midnight vote when no one is paying attention…)

This is what happens when Democrats seize power

This insane level of tyranny is happening because Democrats now run the entire legislative and executive branches of the Virginia state government. Governor Ralph Northam — who openly confessed to advocating infanticide and child murder — is leading the charge to turn the great state of Virginia into a modern-day slave camp where no citizen is allowed to defend herself against the tyranny of the local government (which has gone completely insane and is now run by relentless criminals).

This demonstration of blunt force tyranny showcases the real plan of Democrats when it comes to disarming the American people: This was never about “commonsense gun reforms,” you see. In truth, it has always been about criminalizing the very idea of self-defense and self-reliance.

The government of Virginia, honestly stated, doesn’t want you to be able to defend yourself against violent criminals. Why? Because if you had the capacity to do that, you might also be able to defend yourself against the violence of oppressive, corrupt government, too.

It is now time to defeat all Democrats and remove them from office forever

When you are living in a state where you can be arrested and imprisoned for taking a self-defense class and learning how to kick, punch or shoot rapists and would-be violent criminals, you are living under a criminal enterprise of political tyranny that must be taken down and defeated.

Not coincidentally, this proposed new SB64 law would criminalize the very assembling of law-abiding citizens who might rise up and challenge the criminal tyrants in Richmond who are busy rigging the system to make sure no Virginian can ever challenge the tyranny of Democrat rule. In effect, Democrats are passing laws to criminalize resistance to tyranny in much the same way that Democrats in Congress are trying to impeach Trump for the “crime” of resisting a political coup.

You are watching a system of tyranny shore up its own defenses against informed citizens, knowing that the corruption of Democrats is so deeply embedded in their authoritarian rule that sooner or later, honest Virginians have both a right and a duty to oppose, defeat and dismantle that system of tyranny by all means afforded the citizens under the Constitution of the United States of America.

The process of transforming Virginia from a patriotic, independent, pro-liberty state (May 15, 1776) into a corrupt, authoritarian slave camp run by filthy left-wing criminals only took 243 years, by the way. And it happened because conservatives and patriots got too apathetic and lazy to take sufficient action to keep tyranny in check. While the citizens slumber in comfort, tyranny is always plotting its next takeover. The GOP of Virginia practically surrendered the state to the Democrats, even refusing to run candidates in many districts during recent elections.

Suddenly, the citizens of Virginia find themselves living under extremist left-wing tyranny. The thing about tyranny is that you can sleep your way into it, but history has shown that you have to fight your way out of it.

Today, Virginians are in the fight of their lives.

No wonder dozens of counties in Virginia are hurriedly declaring themselves to be Second Amendment Sanctuary Counties in order to escape the tyrannical rule of Richmond’s authoritarian tyrants.

How to declare your county a 2A Sanctuary county

If you live in Virginia or any other state where left-wing tyrants are trying to criminalize self-defense, read this important guide on how to get your own county declared a “2A Sanctuary” for human freedom and safety.

You might also want to get off your ass and work to defeat these tyrant lunatics before they destroy everything you value: Life, liberty and happiness.

If you’re a Virginian, your ancestors are practically demanding you take action to restore the liberty upon which Virginia was originally founded.

And if you can’t get rid of the left-wing lunatics in Richmond, at least you can plan to surround them with pro-2A counties while you wait for things to really hit the fan.

Real Virginians already know this is a do-or-die moment for the future of your state. Get to work, or you will lose everything. The Democrats aren’t just coming for your guns; they’re coming for your humanity and your very right to exist.

All this tyranny being unleashed against the citizens of Virginia, by the way, will soon be enforced across the entire country if the Democrats take the White House in 2020.

Count on it.

They will come for you and stick a gun in your face and throw you in prison. In fact, they are promising to do so. And they will then take your children and lock them in a public school transgender indoctrination camp where greasy pedophile men will waggle their junk in their faces while they role play sexual assault scenarios in the name of “tolerance.” Left-wing government has truly become a psychological terrorism racket that now preys upon children while seeking to crush all resistance from informed adults.

How long, exactly, did you plan to put up with this insanity?

They intend to screw over our greatest generation by removing from them everything that we have earned over the years. They do not work for the betterment of the nation. They only look out for themselves.

The two held a  joint press conference yesterday to announce their intention to remove from senior citizens what they termed “entitlements“, such as Social Security and Medicare. Omar showed her lack of class and understanding of how America works when she stepped up to the microphone.

“America is for the young. It is the youth of this country that work to make it great. They are productive and tax paying. They contribute…..unlike our senior citizens who only take. Retirees are dead weight.”

That speech spoke to Omar’s inability or unwillingness to assimilate to American culture. In Somalia, where she is from, seniors are exiled and left to fend for themselves in the jungle, where they soon perish. It seems she wants the same to happen here.

Cortez, of course, had to put in her two cents, which is all her mind is worth :

“In socialism, we work for the good of the collective. The whole matters more than the individual. People make sacrifices.

Social Security and Medicare cost America tens of billions of dollars every year. And for what? Fora bunch of deadbeats with nothing left to give. That money would be far better spent on low income housing and welfare for the young people of America who just need a leg up.”

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_248928,"In the wake of the Virginia gun rights rally on Monday, Democrats in the Capitol are not slowing down their push for tyranny. They are moving a bill through the legislature that would effectively criminalize dissent against Governor Blackface Northam and other state government officials.

House Bill 1627 was introduced by Delegate Jeffrey M. Bourne last week. The legislation “provides that certain crimes relating to threats and harassment may be prosecuted in the City of Richmond if the victim is the Governor, Governor-elect, Lieutenant Governor, Lieutenant Governor-elect, Attorney General, or Attorney General-elect, a member or employee of the General Assembly, a justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia, or a judge of the Court of Appeals of Virginia.”

Language in the bill explicitly criminalizes free speech, in what would constitute a blatant attack on the 1st Amendment of the Constitution.

“If any person, with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass any person, shall use a computer or computer network to communicate obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten any illegal or immoral act, he is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor,” the legislation reads.

The legislation makes it clear that the above provision applies directly to “the Governor, Governor-elect, Lieutenant Governor, Lieutenant Governor-elect, Attorney General, or Attorney General-elect, a member or employee of the General Assembly, a justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia, or a judge of the Court of Appeals of Virginia,” which means this legislation effectively criminalizes dissent against public officials.

Tina Freitas, wife of Republican Delegate Nick Freitas, called attention to this intolerable act in a Facebook post on Tuesday night.

“Wow on cue, now they are after the 1A! Dems are trying to set up special rules exclusive to the Elite ruling class, to protect themselves from criticism!” Freitas wrote.

“What is considered harassment? Is Governor Infanticide/KKK Hood trying to avoid being held accountable? Are we no longer allowed to demand justice for the alleged rape victims of LG Fairfax? This is some straight up communist censorship!” she added.

Virginia Democrats were not detracted by the gun rights rally on Monday in the slightest. They moved red flag laws through the legislature just a day later, and subsequently killed pro-gun bills that were introduced by Republicans.

“The governor and the leadership of the democrats have declared war on law-abiding citizens and gun owners and their votes today just confirmed that that’s where we’re going,” said Philip Van Cleave, President of Virginia Citizens Defense League.

‘This time I’m scared’: experts fear too late for China virus lockdown

Posted January 24th, 2020 at 10:06 AM (CST) by Bill Holter:

Bill,

I just received a call from a close American friend of mine who just got off the phone with a Chinese friend, who has relatives in Wuhan. He says there may already be ~10,000 dead there from the virus. He was quite graphic about dreadful conditions in the city. He opined that the government was not coming clean on real facts. Imagine that?

It is far worse Bill than people imagine: My friend reiterated that Wuhan, more than other places in China, has a local population which consumes rats, bats, snakes, etc. , just like I told him.

His Wuhan relative recounted incidents of people walking down street and dropping dead. I see why the government has quarantined the place, which means nobody (especially the press) gets out or into the city.

This is really scary stuff. I imagine that China was, and is covering up what they thought was contained and now is not and I doubt they understand the scope of global fallout that they have unleashed.

Cheers,

Robert

Thanks Robert, truly sad on several levels.

I believe this was also a ritual sacrifice for the 49ers to win the Superbowl. Because the ""49"" is the ""13."" Kobe was born on 8/23, when you add those numbers, you get 13. Kobe was also the 13th overall pick in the NBA Draft. Lebron James passed Kobe on the All time scoring list WHEN HE WAS PLAYING THE Philadelphia ""76ERS."" 7+6=13. And Kobe Bryant was born in Philadelphia! He died on 1-26-2020. All those numbers add up to 13. I also find it very strange that there were ""Kobe Bryant Helicopter Toys"" being sold in stores.

Some Chinese people are known to be eating babies, and the news, which has been circulating through the internet and via email, is shocking the world.

An email report received by The Seoul Times confirmed that news with several vivid and appalling pictures of human embryos and fetuses being made into a soup for human consumption.

The report went on. A town in the southern province of Canton (Guangdong) is now in focus. Chinese folks there are enjoying baby herbal soup to increase overall health and stamina and the power of sexual performance in particular.

A human baby is being prepared for food in China.

The cost in Chinese currency is approximately Rs 2,000 (which is about US$4,000).

A factory manager was interviewed and he testified that it is effective because he is a frequent customer.

It is a delicacy whereby expensive herbs are added to boil the baby with chicken meat for eight hours.

He pointed to his second wife next to him. She is 19 years old. The 62-year-old man testified that they have sex everyday.

After waiting for a couple of weeks he took the reporter to the restaurant when he was informed by the restaurant manager that the spare rib soup (local code for baby soup) was now available.

A human baby is dumped into the water for boiling in China.

This time, a couple who already has two daughters decided to abort the child after receiving confirmation that it was another girl. The baby was already five months old.

Those babies who are close to be born and die naturally costs 2000 in China currency. Those aborted ones cost a few hundreds in China currency.

Those couples who did not want to sell dead babies, placentas can be accepted also for couple of hundreds.

One local reporter was quoted as saying that this is the problem arising from Chinese taking too much attention in health or is the backfire effect when China introduced one child in a family policy.

This heinous crimes rise from the fact that majority of Chinese people prefer to have male babies and the poor families end up selling their female babies.

Dead babied can be purchased in Taiwan for 70 US dollars for being used as grilled delicacies.

While giving a discourse on the viability of zero discipline indictments, she veered off content to discuss arraigning our leader and depict in detail one “wrongdoing” she would not stop for a second to rebuff, to the outright joy of the liberal group.

“… taking everything into account, I am certain that on the off chance that we quit being mean to these poor spirits, they will come around and be gainful citizenry. There are no awful individuals, just awful legal frameworks. That is a totally different story that will be composed later.

As you remember, Robert Francis O'Rourke tried to save his dying campaign last year by speaking the Democrat Party's unspeakable truth: gun confiscation is their ultimate goal and the next time the country elects a Democrat President, he or she will be coming for Americans' guns.

Biden apologists tried to explain away his new partnership with ""Beto"" by saying that it does not equate to a full endorsement of all of the gun control proposals from O'Rourke's campaign.

But during a late night stop at a Whataburger after that rally, Biden was asked about his new partnership with O'Rourke and admitted what we have known all along. He is no moderate and if elected, he will confiscate Americans' firearms...

And there it is. Biden didn't just offer ""Beto"" a job. He offered to adopt his most radical gun control proposals as well.

Carter dropped a mention of his vote to the crowd at the Carter Center, where Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) joined him for a discussion about global peace and human rights.
During the lengthy talk, Sanders mentioned the Unites States’ low voter turnout rates and how that tends to swing elections for conservatives. That statement apparently struck a chord with Carter.
“Can y’all see why I voted for him?” Carter said to some laughs from the crowd.
Carter previously stayed mostly mum about the 2020 election.
Jimmy Carter’s one-term presidency is remembered for the events that overwhelmed it—inflation, energy crisis, war in Afghanistan, and hostages in Iran. After one term in office, voters strongly rejected Jimmy Carter’s honest but gloomy outlook in favor of Ronald Reagan’s telegenic optimism. In the past two decades, however, there has been wider recognition that Carter, despite a lack of experience, confronted several huge problems with steadiness, courage, and idealism. Along with his predecessor Gerald Ford, Carter must be given credit for restoring the balance to the constitutional system after the excesses of the Johnson and Nixon “imperial presidency.”"

Josiah Barron, the praised chairman of Los Angeles County, was driven away from his office in binds today by ICE specialists and accused of harboring outlaws from the law with his choice to give undocumented settlers shelter under his ‘Asylum City’ assignment.

The capture followed Barron’s structure to the city’s police to not help out ICE by announcing expatriates in their authority. ICE requested the hoodlums be given over yet they were denied. This has occurred in other Sanctuary urban communities the nation over with no such charges laid, however no doubt Immigration authorities have at long last had enough of their government authority being overlooked and have chosen to quit getting along.

Barron appeared to see his problem as interesting, as he grinned and yelled, “ATTICA! ATTICA!” while being directed to a holding up vehicle. Be that as it may, he won’t be giggling for long. The charges against him convey a greatest punishment of 20 years in jail should he be indicted and lawful specialists state that a blameworthy decision is very likely given Barron’s exceptionally open explanations – admissions, at the end of the day – that let it be realized that the city would not speak with ICE by his own announcement.

ICE representative Satya Martin told journalists that this capture is only the start:

“Non-residents are hoodlums. That is all. We’ve shown restraint toward Sanctuary civic chairmen, trusting they’d see the mistake of their ways, however never again. Our main responsibility is to make this nation more secure and nobody will disrupt the general flow of that objective.”

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_625703,"For Americans who see the Democrat Left behind the over-hyped media coverage and societal reactions to the coronavirus ‘pandemic,’ The New York Times, God bless ’em, just proved those suspicions correct.
And wouldn’t you know it, the strategy is a familiar one: Use a manufactured crisis to get rid of President Donald Trump.
Oh, true, coronavirus is real enough, But given it’s so-far minuscule infection rate in the U.S. (1,600 or so), death rate (~40), and the fact that more than half of patients infected by the disease globally have already recovered, there is no reason to shutter professional sports seasons or declare states of emergency when you have a single case of the virus in your state.
Not at this point. Yet, those things — and more, including bans on public gatherings — have happened.
Why? Think November 2020.
Under the headline, “Trump’s Re-election Chances Suddenly Look Shakier,” the Times reports:
President Trump faces the biggest challenge yet to his prospects of being re-elected, with his advisers’ two major assumptions for the campaign — a booming economy and an opponent easily vilified as too far left — quickly evaporating.
After a year in which Mr. Trump has told voters that they must support his re-election or risk watching the economy decline, the stock market is reeling and economists are warning that a recession could be on the horizon because of the worsening spread of the coronavirus.
And instead of elevating Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, as Mr. Trump made clear was his hope, Democrats have suddenly and decisively swung from a flirtation with socialism to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has run a primary campaign centered on a return to political normalcy.
“Biden’s success in the suburbs makes him an acceptable alternative to Trump,” said Scott Reed, the top political adviser for the United States Chamber of Commerce. “His turnout in the suburbs threatens the Republican Senate.”
Said Kevin DeWine, the former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, to the Times — and this is telling: “If it was Warren or Bernie and you don’t have coronavirus, I think Trump might sneak by. But if it’s Biden, ‘My I.R.A. has tanked,’ and we’re going to have complete disruption because of coronavirus, I think it’s a totally different story.”
The Times concedes:
Of course, what happens in March may ultimately have little bearing in November. Mr. Trump maintains the bully pulpit of the presidency, and Mr. Biden largely avoided intense scrutiny from rivals in a crowded, up-and-down primary campaign.
And if there’s any constant in the Trump era, it is that what’s in the news at a given moment will change in a matter of hours, days or at most weeks. The virus may be mitigated, the economy could rebound, and Mr. Biden’s decades of life in Washington and propensity for gaffes may render him as weak a candidate as some of his rivals in the primary had long predicted.
Yet if Mr. Trump does lose re-election, the seeds of demise may prove to have been planted in early spring.
There is no way Joe “Gaffe” Biden has a shot in Hades against Trump this fall unless certain economic and social conditions occur. Or are exploited thanks to the timely occurrence of events.
We didn’t figure it would be long before the real intention behind all the sports cancellations, states of emergencies declared by Democratic governors, and outsized Democratic congressional responses to a so-far limited viral outbreak — not to mention the asinine tanking of the stock market — were revealed.
And the Times didn’t let us down.
Consider — and this should anger every single American who has their retirement savings wrapped up in investment vehicles and 401(k) accounts: The Democratic Left is proving beyond any doubt they are willing to burn down your savings and your future just to get a short-term political victory.
We have words for people like that but we won’t publish them."

However, it has been confirmed by anonymous sources that a league shutdown has been in the making for months and that they were simply looking for a good excuse to shut it all down.

The players, led by Washington Generals All-Star Power Forward Art Tubolls, held a secret vote prior to the beginning of the season to suspend the league for any credible reason until President Donald Trump resigns from office or is voted out. Since much of the league is made up of Hollywood actor and musician wannabes, these millionaire crybabies overwhelming voted to approve the measure.

Tubolls said

“Our league is the most popular league in the world and we have a lot of teams in the swing states. We know that we cannot directly pressure the President into resigning but if we can hold his approval rating hostage and make the people scream for his removal, that’s what we’ll do.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_Social media_960789,"Staged Event?  
These officers were involved with something, I’m not sure exactly what, but something is just not adding up.
I think there is at the very least the “possibility”, that this was a filmed public execution of a black man by a white cop, with the purpose of creating racial tensions and driving a wedge in the growing group of anti deep state sentiment from comon people, that have already been psychologically traumatized by Covid 19 fears. 
Historically, in  election years and in politically contested areas or in groups, racial or gun violence incidents are becoming common place.  Considering the rising approval rating of President Trump in the black community, an event like this was unfortunately “Predictable”
Consider these points and contrast them to every other police brutality incident you've ever seen.
The filmed portion of the incident was about 10 minutes long.   In that amount of time, three officers are holding one handcuffed man down. You only know that because of the pictures taken from across the street. You can't see the other two officers in the video because they are behind the vehicle.  During 8 minutes of the entire video, the officer has his knee on George Floyd's neck, which is not taught or approved by any law enforcement agency. 
Additionally, other than the Asian officer speaking occasionally to the crowd of bystanders, there is no communication from any of the officers to Mr. Floyd.  No talking, no shouting.  When have you ever seen a police brutality video without police shouting?
Additionally, the police had no goal.  They weren't trying to subdue him for arrest, he was already handcuffed and all they needed to do, was place him in the back of the car.  There is no plausible explanation for taking him to the ground and having three men on top of a handcuffed man, a knee placed on his neck.  Mr. Floyd presented no threat and was not resisting.   The only goal that there appeared to be was exactly what happened: “To be filmed brutally killing a black man”. 
Think about this, these officers did not care about being filmed, in fact the officer stared into the camera with soulless eyes and an emotionless face, reminiscent of an assassin, as he knowingly killed an American Citizen.
None of the officers spoke among themselves or did they speak to Mr. Floyd.  They did not respond to his pleas for life. They just sat and kneeled on him until he was passed out and then waited an additional 4 minutes after Mr. Floyd lost consciousness to ensure that Mr. Floyd was dead and could not be revived. 
The bystanders are verbally communicating to the officers, that he isn't breathing. Unlike any other similar incident, you never see the officers getting on police radios. You never see or hear them calling dispatch for backup. No other police units arrive on the scene and  strangely enough, the crowd does not seem to grow either.
The scene does not end until an ambulance arrives and they unceremoniously flop him on a gurney.  At no point does anyone in a uniform ever check his vitals. “As if they aren't remotely curious about the situation they are in” BTW. who called the ambulance and for what reason? Because if the reason was that Mr. Floyd was having a medical issue, they wouldn't have still been crushing his neck.  
Shortly after the video went viral, a fake Facebook page supposedly belonging to the officer,  at the center of the murder appears and pictures are uploaded that say ""Stand your Ground"" and ""Trump 2020"".   A picture of the cop with a red ballcap that says ""Make America White Again"".  A friends list populated with obvious sock accounts and people clearly not his friends.   This is the same kind of fake Facebook stunt that happened with a group made to look like support for the men involved with the Ahmed Aubrey case.
Is it mere coincidence that this happens the week after “race” becomes a major political issue after the Biden ""You ain't Black"" gaffe, started to threaten the black vote the Democrats so desperately count on? 
Additionally, there is substantial video evidence to arrest at least one officer now.  Why would the local authorities not charge him immediately, unless there was a political advantage not to! 
Is it mere coincidence that this happens right about the exact moment the COVID-19 fear campaign falls apart, and after it has psychologically traumatized the entire country and got everyone at each other's throats and suicide attempts are spiking?   Is it mere coincidence that this happens after the Auhmed Aubrey case... Which somehow eluded the mainstream media completely until two whole months after he was killed? When has that ever happened? Timing issue?  Is it mere coincidence that Supreme Race Baiter Obama was making videos a couple weeks ago connecting COVID with ""Systemic Racism""?
FINALLY....‼️‼️ this entire scene plays out with the cop car and license plate that says ""POLICE"".  The plate was perfectly framed for maximum subliminal impact. This also means he was literally just 1 foot away from the back seat of the police car and these cops thought it was smarter to kill a black man on camera, than to pick him up and move him one foot into the back of the police car.
You can draw your own conclusions, but this appears to have all the earmarks of George Soros.  Please open your eyes!!!!

Kneeling across the street from the White House, they were seen wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts and singing “Amazing Grace” while holding hands with other protestors.

But things took a turn for the worse when riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd, all to clear the way for President Donald Jebediah Trump to waddle across the street for a photo op in front of a church he doesn’t attend, wave around a copy of a holy book he doesn’t read, and ramble like a psychotic dictator of a country he doesn’t love.

Sasha and Malia had come to the protest equipped with military-grade gas masks, so they were not overcome by the tear gas that crippled so many of their fellow protestors. They stood still in front of the advancing police, trying to give others a chance to escape the rubber bullets and tear gas.

As the police shoved their way through the peaceful crowd, an enraged officer ripped an American flag out of the hands of a group of high school students who were standing silently, holding the flag, and refusing to give up their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble.

Just then, recognizing the Obama daughters, the cop wadded up the flag, lit a corner of it on fire, waved to a news camera from OAN, and threw the burning flag at Sasha and Malia.

The Obamas, horrified to see a flag being burned, stretched it out between them to try to keep more of it from catching fire. That’s when the camera caught the image of them, holding a burning American flag.

According to the ad Soros placed on Craigslist, protesters would be fully compensated for all of their time and expenses. They found out that the money dried up the moment they got arrested.
A spokesman for the Soros company, Paid Liberal Trolls of America, says the men and women who signed up were told up-front that they should obey the law and not go to jail:
“They were paid for 6 hours at $30 per hour, plus a meal stipend of $40 per day. Add to that a very generous 70 cents per mile for travel and a big cookie, and these people were given neary $1K to be there. All they had to do was go home before curfew. They chose to stay, so they can pay their own bail.”
Soros has a bad habit of not paying bail for his protesters, citing case after case of people not showing up for court. “If they don’t show up. we don’t get those funds back, and we can’t write them off as a business expense,” said Attorney Joe Barron, “They should know better than to expect someone as kind as George Soros to just toss an extra $500 per person out the window.”
Some protesters might be satisfied with that answer, but most are not. According to their leader, Art Tubolls, the 163 people filing the suit will show at the Soros mansion in Deluth if they have to:
“We’re not afraid to protest for real. Charlie Kirk and Turning Point said they’ll fund that endeavor, even if it means he has to bail us out. That guy’s giant head is filled with kindness.”

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_116079,"Lockdowns and hygienic measures around the world are based on numbers of cases and mortality rates created by the so-called SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests used to identify “positive” patients, whereby “positive” is usually equated with “infected.”

But looking closely at the facts, the conclusion is that these PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2.

UNFOUNDED “TEST, TEST, TEST,…” MANTRA
At the media briefing on COVID-19 on March 16, 2020, the WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said:

We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.”

The message was spread through headlines around the world, for instance by Reuters and the BBC.

Still on the 3 of May, the moderator of the heute journal — one of the most important news magazines on German television— was passing the mantra of the corona dogma on to his audience with the admonishing words:

Test, test, test—that is the credo at the moment, and it is the only way to really understand how much the coronavirus is spreading.”

This indicates that the belief in the validity of the PCR tests is so strong that it equals a religion that tolerates virtually no contradiction.

But it is well known that religions are about faith and not about scientific facts. And as Walter Lippmann, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and perhaps the most influential journalist of the 20th century said: “Where all think alike, no one thinks very much.”

So to start, it is very remarkable that Kary Mullis himself, the inventor of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology, did not think alike. His invention got him the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1993.

Unfortunately, Mullis passed away last year at the age of 74, but there is no doubt that the biochemist regarded the PCR as inappropriate to detect a viral infection.

The reason is that the intended use of the PCR was, and still is, to apply it as a manufacturing technique, being able to replicate DNA sequences millions and billions of times, and not as a diagnostic tool to detect viruses.

How declaring virus pandemics based on PCR tests can end in disaster was described by Gina Kolata in her 2007 New York Times article Faith in Quick Test Leads to Epidemic That Wasn’t.

LACK OF A VALID GOLD STANDARD
Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the PCR tests used to identify so-called COVID-19 patients presumably infected by what is called SARS-CoV-2 do not have a valid gold standard to compare them with.

This is a fundamental point. Tests need to be evaluated to determine their preciseness — strictly speaking their “sensitivity”[1] and “specificity” — by comparison with a “gold standard,” meaning the most accurate method available.

As an example, for a pregnancy test the gold standard would be the pregnancy itself. But as Australian infectious diseases specialist Sanjaya Senanayake, for example, stated in an ABC TV interview in an answer to the question “How accurate is the [COVID-19] testing?”:

If we had a new test for picking up [the bacterium] golden staph in blood, we’ve already got blood cultures, that’s our gold standard we’ve been using for decades, and we could match this new test against that. But for COVID-19 we don’t have a gold standard test.”

Jessica C. Watson from Bristol University confirms this. In her paper “Interpreting a COVID-19 test result”, published recently in The British Medical Journal, she writes that there is a “lack of such a clear-cut ‘gold-standard’ for COVID-19 testing.”

But instead of classifying the tests as unsuitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection and COVID-19 diagnosis, or instead of pointing out that only a virus, proven through isolation and purification, can be a solid gold standard, Watson claims in all seriousness that, “pragmatically” COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, “may be the best available ‘gold standard’.” But this is not scientifically sound.

Apart from the fact that it is downright absurd to take the PCR test itself as part of the gold standard to evaluate the PCR test, there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, as even people such as Thomas Löscher, former head of the Department of Infection and Tropical Medicine at the University of Munich and member of the Federal Association of German Internists, conceded to us[2].

And if there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, COVID-19 diagnosis — contrary to Watson’s statement — cannot be suitable for serving as a valid gold standard.

In addition, “experts” such as Watson overlook the fact that only virus isolation, i.e. an unequivocal virus proof, can be the gold standard.

That is why I asked Watson how COVID-19 diagnosis “may be the best available gold standard,” if there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, and also whether the virus itself, that is virus isolation, wouldn’t be the best available/possible gold standard. But she hasn’t answered these questions yet – despite multiple requests. And she has not yet responded to our rapid response post on her article in which we address exactly the same points, either, though she wrote us on June 2nd: “I will try to post a reply later this week when I have a chance.”

NO PROOF FOR THE RNA BEING OF VIRAL ORIGIN
Now the question is: What is required first for virus isolation/proof? We need to know where the RNA for which the PCR tests are calibrated comes from.

As textbooks (e.g., White/Fenner. Medical Virology, 1986, p. 9) as well as leading virus researchers such as Luc Montagnier or Dominic Dwyer state, particle purification — i.e. the separation of an object from everything else that is not that object, as for instance Nobel laureate Marie Curie purified 100 mg of radium chloride in 1898 by extracting it from tons of pitchblende — is an essential pre-requisite for proving the existence of a virus, and thus to prove that the RNA from the particle in question comes from a new virus.

The reason for this is that PCR is extremely sensitive, which means it can detect even the smallest pieces of DNA or RNA — but it cannot determine where these particles came from. That has to be determined beforehand.

And because the PCR tests are calibrated for gene sequences (in this case RNA sequences because SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be a RNA virus), we have to know that these gene snippets are part of the looked-for virus. And to know that, correct isolation and purification of the presumed virus has to be executed.

Hence, we have asked the science teams of the relevant papers which are referred to in the context of SARS-CoV-2 for proof whether the electron-microscopic shots depicted in their in vitro experiments show purified viruses.

But not a single team could answer that question with “yes” — and NB., nobody said purification was not a necessary step. We only got answers like “No, we did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification” (see below).

We asked several study authors “Do your electron micrographs show the purified virus?”, they gave the following responses:

Regarding the mentioned papers it is clear that what is shown in the electron micrographs (EMs) is the end result of the experiment, meaning there is no other result that they could have made EMs from.

That is to say, if the authors of these studies concede that their published EMs do not show purified particles, then they definitely do not possess purified particles claimed to be viral. (In this context, it has to be remarked that some researchers use the term “isolation” in their papers, but the procedures described therein do not represent a proper isolation (purification) process. Consequently, in this context the term “isolation” is misused).

Thus, the authors of four of the principal, early 2020 papers claiming discovery of a new coronavirus concede they had no proof that the origin of the virus genome was viral-like particles or cellular debris, pure or impure, or particles of any kind. In other words, the existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is based on faith, not fact.

We have also contacted Dr Charles Calisher, who is a seasoned virologist. In 2001, Science published an “impassioned plea…to the younger generation” from several veteran virologists, among them Calisher, saying that:

[modern virus detection methods like] sleek polymerase chain reaction […] tell little or nothing about how a virus multiplies, which animals carry it, [or] how it makes people sick. [It is] like trying to say whether somebody has bad breath by looking at his fingerprint.”[3]

And that’s why we asked Dr Calisher whether he knows one single paper in which SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated and finally really purified. His answer:

I know of no such a publication. I have kept an eye out for one.”[4]

This actually means that one cannot conclude that the RNA gene sequences, which the scientists took from the tissue samples prepared in the mentioned in vitro trials and for which the PCR tests are finally being “calibrated,” belong to a specific virus — in this case SARS-CoV-2.

In addition, there is no scientific proof that those RNA sequences are the causative agent of what is called COVID-19.

In order to establish a causal connection, one way or the other, i.e. beyond virus isolation and purification, it would have been absolutely necessary to carry out an experiment that satisfies the four Koch’s postulates. But there is no such experiment, as Amory Devereux and Rosemary Frei recently revealed for OffGuardian.

The necessity to fulfill these postulates regarding SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated not least by the fact that attempts have been made to fulfill them. But even researchers claiming they have done it, in reality, did not succeed.

One example is a study published in Nature on May 7. This trial, besides other procedures which render the study invalid, did not meet any of the postulates.

For instance, the alleged “infected” laboratory mice did not show any relevant clinical symptoms clearly attributable to pneumonia, which according to the third postulate should actually occur if a dangerous and potentially deadly virus was really at work there. And the slight bristles and weight loss, which were observed temporarily in the animals are negligible, not only because they could have been caused by the procedure itself, but also because the weight went back to normal again.

Also, no animal died except those they killed to perform the autopsies. And let’s not forget: These experiments should have been done before developing a test, which is not the case.

Revealingly, none of the leading German representatives of the official theory about SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19 — the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI), Alexander S. Kekulé (University of Halle), Hartmut Hengel and Ralf Bartenschlager (German Society for Virology), the aforementioned Thomas Löscher, Ulrich Dirnagl (Charité Berlin) or Georg Bornkamm (virologist and professor emeritus at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Munich) — could answer the following question I have sent them:

If the particles that are claimed to be to be SARS-CoV-2 have not been purified, how do you want to be sure that the RNA gene sequences of these particles belong to a specific new virus?

Particularly, if there are studies showing that substances such as antibiotics that are added to the test tubes in the in vitro experiments carried out for virus detection can “stress” the cell culture in a way that new gene sequences are being formed that were not previously detectable — an aspect that Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock already drew attention to in her Nobel Lecture back in 1983.

It should not go unmentioned that we finally got the Charité – the employer of Christian Drosten, Germany’s most influential virologist in respect of COVID-19, advisor to the German government and co-developer of the PCR test which was the first to be “accepted” (not validated!) by the WHO worldwide – to answer questions on the topic.

But we didn’t get answers until June 18, 2020, after months of non-response. In the end, we achieved it only with the help of Berlin lawyer Viviane Fischer.

Regarding our question “Has the Charité convinced itself that appropriate particle purification was carried out?,” the Charité concedes that they didn’t use purified particles.

And although they claim “virologists at the Charité are sure that they are testing for the virus,” in their paper (Corman et al.) they state:

RNA was extracted from clinical samples with the MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) and from cell culture supernatants with the viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany),”

Which means they just assumed the RNA was viral.

Incidentally, the Corman et al. paper, published on January 23, 2020 didn’t even go through a proper peer review process, nor were the procedures outlined therein accompanied by controls — although it is only through these two things that scientific work becomes really solid.

IRRATIONAL TEST RESULTS
It is also certain that we cannot know the false positive rate of the PCR tests without widespread testing of people who certainly do not have the virus, proven by a method which is independent of the test (having a solid gold standard).

Therefore, it is hardly surprising that there are several papers illustrating irrational test results.

For example, already in February the health authority in China’s Guangdong province reported that people have fully recovered from illness blamed on COVID-19, started to test “negative,” and then tested “positive” again.

A month later, a paper published in the Journal of Medical Virology showed that 29 out of 610 patients at a hospital in Wuhan had 3 to 6 test results that flipped between “negative”, “positive” and “dubious”.

A third example is a study from Singapore in which tests were carried out almost daily on 18 patients and the majority went from “positive” to “negative” back to “positive” at least once, and up to five times in one patient.

Even Wang Chen, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, conceded in February that the PCR tests are “only 30 to 50 per cent accurate”; while Sin Hang Lee from the Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory sent a letter to the WHO’s coronavirus response team and to Anthony S. Fauci on March 22, 2020, saying that:

It has been widely reported in the social media that the RT-qPCR [Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR] test kits used to detect SARSCoV-2 RNA in human specimens are generating many false positive results and are not sensitive enough to detect some real positive cases.”

In other words, even if we theoretically assume that these PCR tests can really detect a viral infection, the tests would be practically worthless, and would only cause an unfounded scare among the “positive” people tested.

This becomes also evident considering the positive predictive value (PPV).

The PPV indicates the probability that a person with a positive test result is truly “positive” (ie. has the supposed virus), and it depends on two factors: the prevalence of the virus in the general population and the specificity of the test, that is the percentage of people without disease in whom the test is correctly “negative” (a test with a specificity of 95% incorrectly gives a positive result in 5 out of 100 non-infected people).

With the same specificity, the higher the prevalence, the higher the PPV.

In this context, on June 12 2020, the journal Deutsches Ärzteblatt published an article in which the PPV has been calculated with three different prevalence scenarios.

The results must, of course, be viewed very critically, first because it is not possible to calculate the specificity without a solid gold standard, as outlined, and second because the calculations in the article are based on the specificity determined in the study by Jessica Watson, which is potentially worthless, as also mentioned.

But if you abstract from it, assuming that the underlying specificity of 95% is correct and that we know the prevalence, even the mainstream medical journal Deutsches Ärzteblatt reports that the so-called SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests may have “a shockingly low” PPV.

In one of the three scenarios, figuring with an assumed prevalence of 3%, the PPV was only 30 percent, which means that 70 percent of the people tested “positive” are not “positive” at all. Yet “they are prescribed quarantine,” as even the Ärzteblatt notes critically.

In a second scenario of the journal’s article, a prevalence of rate of 20 percent is assumed. In this case they generate a PPV of 78 percent, meaning that 22 percent of the “positive” tests are false “positives.”

That would mean: If we take the around 9 million people who are currently considered “positive” worldwide — supposing that the true “positives” really have a viral infection — we would get almost 2 million false “positives.”

All this fits with the fact that the CDC and the FDA, for instance, concede in their files that the so-called “SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests” are not suitable for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.

In the “CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel“ file from March 30, 2020, for example, it says:

Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms”

And:

This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.”

And the FDA admits that:

positive results […] do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.”

Remarkably, in the instruction manuals of PCR tests we can also read that they are not intended as a diagnostic test, as for instance in those by Altona Diagnostics and Creative Diagnostics[5].

To quote another one, in the product announcement of the LightMix Modular Assays produced by TIB Molbiol — which were developed using the Corman et al. protocol — and distributed by Roche we can read:

These assays are not intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of coronavirus infection”

And:

For research use only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.”

WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THAT THE TESTS CAN MEASURE THE “VIRAL LOAD”?
There is also reason to conclude that the PCR test from Roche and others cannot even detect the targeted genes.

Moreover, in the product descriptions of the RT-qPCR tests for SARS-COV-2 it says they are “qualitative” tests, contrary to the fact that the “q” in “qPCR” stands for “quantitative.” And if these tests are not “quantitative” tests, they don’t show how many viral particles are in the body.

That is crucial because, in order to even begin talking about actual illness in the real world not only in a laboratory, the patient would need to have millions and millions of viral particles actively replicating in their body.

That is to say, the CDC, the WHO, the FDA or the RKI may assert that the tests can measure the so-called “viral load,” i.e. how many viral particles are in the body. “But this has never been proven. That is an enormous scandal,” as the journalist Jon Rappoport points out.

This is not only because the term “viral load” is deception. If you put the question “what is viral load?” at a dinner party, people take it to mean viruses circulating in the bloodstream. They’re surprised to learn it’s actually RNA molecules.

Also, to prove beyond any doubt that the PCR can measure how much a person is “burdened” with a disease-causing virus, the following experiment would have had to be carried out (which has not yet happened):

You take, let’s say, a few hundred or even thousand people and remove tissue samples from them. Make sure the people who take the samples do not perform the test.The testers will never know who the patients are and what condition they’re in. The testers run their PCR on the tissue samples. In each case, they say which virus they found and how much of it they found. Then, for example, in patients 29, 86, 199, 272, and 293 they found a great deal of what they claim is a virus. Now we un-blind those patients. They should all be sick, because they have so much virus replicating in their bodies. But are they really sick — or are they fit as a fiddle?

With the help of the aforementioned lawyer Viviane Fischer, I finally got the Charité to also answer the question of whether the test developed by Corman et al. — the so-called “Drosten PCR test” — is a quantitative test.

But the Charité was not willing to answer this question “yes”. Instead, the Charité wrote:

If real-time RT-PCR is involved, to the knowledge of the Charité in most cases these are […] limited to qualitative detection.”

Furthermore, the “Drosten PCR test” uses the unspecific E-gene assay as preliminary assay, while the Institut Pasteur uses the same assay as confirmatory assay.

According to Corman et al., the E-gene assay is likely to detect all Asian viruses, while the other assays in both tests are supposed to be more specific for sequences labelled “SARS-CoV-2”.

Besides the questionable purpose of having either a preliminary or a confirmatory test that is likely to detect all Asian viruses, at the beginning of April the WHO changed the algorithm, recommending that from then on a test can be regarded as “positive” even if just the E-gene assay (which is likely to detect all Asian viruses!) gives a “positive” result.

This means that a confirmed unspecific test result is officially sold as specific.

That change of algorithm increased the “case” numbers. Tests using the E-gene assay are produced for example by Roche, TIB Molbiol and R-Biopharm.

HIGH CQ VALUES MAKE THE TEST RESULTS EVEN MORE MEANINGLESS
Another essential problem is that many PCR tests have a “cycle quantification” (Cq) value of over 35, and some, including the “Drosten PCR test”, even have a Cq of 45.

The Cq value specifies how many cycles of DNA replication are required to detect a real signal from biological samples.

“Cq values higher than 40 are suspect because of the implied low efficiency and generally should not be reported,” as it says in the MIQE guidelines.

MIQE stands for “Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments”, a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating publications on Real-Time PCR, also called quantitative PCR, or qPCR.

The inventor himself, Kary Mullis, agreed, when he stated:

If you have to go more than 40 cycles to amplify a single-copy gene, there is something seriously wrong with your PCR.”

The MIQE guidelines have been developed under the aegis of Stephen A. Bustin, Professor of Molecular Medicine, a world-renowned expert on quantitative PCR and author of the book A-Z of Quantitative PCR which has been called “the bible of qPCR.”

In a recent podcast interview Bustin points out that “the use of such arbitrary Cq cut-offs is not ideal, because they may be either too low (eliminating valid results) or too high (increasing false “positive” results).”


And, according to him, a Cq in the 20s to 30s should be aimed at and there is concern regarding the reliability of the results for any Cq over 35.

If the Cq value gets too high, it becomes difficult to distinguish real signal from background, for example due to reactions of primers and fluorescent probes, and hence there is a higher probability of false positives.

Moreover, among other factors that can alter the result, before starting with the actual PCR, in case you are looking for presumed RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the RNA must be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) with the enzyme Reverse Transcriptase—hence the “RT” at the beginning of “PCR” or “qPCR.”

But this transformation process is “widely recognized as inefficient and variable,” as Jessica Schwaber from the Centre for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine in Toronto and two research colleagues pointed out in a 2019 paper.

Stephen A. Bustin acknowledges problems with PCR in a comparable way.

For example, he pointed to the problem that in the course of the conversion process (RNA to cDNA) the amount of DNA obtained with the same RNA base material can vary widely, even by a factor of 10 (see above interview).

Considering that the DNA sequences get doubled at every cycle, even a slight variation becomes magnified and can thus alter the result, annihilating the test’s reliable informative value.

So how can it be that those who claim the PCR tests are highly meaningful for so-called COVID-19 diagnosis blind out the fundamental inadequacies of these tests—even if they are confronted with questions regarding their validity?

Certainly, the apologists of the novel coronavirus hypothesis should have dealt with these questions before throwing the tests on the market and putting basically the whole world under lockdown, not least because these are questions that come to mind immediately for anyone with even a spark of scientific understanding.

Thus, the thought inevitably emerges that financial and political interests play a decisive role for this ignorance about scientific obligations. NB, the WHO, for example has financial ties with drug companies, as the British Medical Journal showed in 2010.

And experts criticize “that the notorious corruption and conflicts of interest at WHO have continued, even grown“ since then. The CDC as well, to take another big player, is obviously no better off.

Finally, the reasons and possible motives remain speculative, and many involved surely act in good faith; but the science is clear: The numbers generated by these RT-PCR tests do not in the least justify frightening people who have been tested “positive” and imposing lockdown measures that plunge countless people into poverty and despair or even drive them to suicide.

And a “positive” result may have serious consequences for the patients as well, because then all non-viral factors are excluded from the diagnosis and the patients are treated with highly toxic drugs and invasive intubations. Especially for elderly people and patients with pre-existing conditions such a treatment can be fatal, as we have outlined in the article “Fatal Therapie.”

Without doubt eventual excess mortality rates are caused by the therapy and by the lockdown measures, while the “COVID-19” death statistics comprise also patients who died of a variety of diseases, redefined as COVID-19 only because of a “positive” test result whose value could not be more doubtful."
Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_999319,"John Elway, former Super Bowl-winning quarterback and Head of Football Operations for the Denver Broncos, has laid down some ground rules for the upcoming season of the NFL. According to our sources inside the locker room who may or may not have direct knowledge of what’s going on, Elway is already polishing up his index finger to point at the traitors he’ll fire.
Ou sports correspondent in the field, James Osborne, says the players are taking the warnings very seriously:
“Elway has made it clear that he won’t stand for any disrespecting of our flag. One of the assistants to an assistant coach said he heard Elway screaming in his office that ‘anyone kneeling on his field during the National Anthem will be fired. If they’re from another team, they’ll be escorted out and not allowed to play.’ We’re not really sure how to enforce that one, but it looks like we’ll have to try or be fired ourselves by old pigeon feet.”
Elway isn’t messing around. Back in 2017, he fired three players on the spot for kneeling, setting off a chain reaction of fact-checking stories and attacks on satire by Snopes. In the end, the players were reinstated because they weren’t real, and Elway was able to keep his public image of being an intolerant jackass completely intact.

If, in some way, your Blood-Brain Barrier is compromised, it becomes a ""Leaky Blood-Brain Barrier"" which is an inflamed brain! It then allows bacteria & other toxins to enter your brain & infect the brain tissue which can lead to inflammation and sometimes death.

Now, take this and add on a contaminated test and see what you get!

Edit from Samuel:

Before you comment as so many have that this is not the blood brain barrier, pls read on

it doesn’t need to penetrate the blood brain barrier. It only needs to violate and bypass the mucus membrane, the olfactory epithileum, then toxins can access the olfactory nerves and reach the neurons/brain

the olfactory receptors have a mucus membrane that protect the nerurons from any toxins that aren’t dissolvable in water. It’s a defence system inhibiting any poisons that you might smell from the air, as in from traffic for instance. This might be a way for the evil agenda folks to bypass this protective layer called the olfactory epithileum and actually increase the risk of sickness by damaging the mucus membrane and allowing more toxins from our heavily polluted environment to enter not to mention enclosed buildings with trapped air and mask wearing with development of bacteria and carbon dioxide.

I’m so confused right now. I see signs all over saying black lives matter. I’m just trying to figure out which black lives matter. It can’t be the unborn black babies. They are destroyed without a second thought. It’s not black cops. They don’t seem to matter. It’s not my black conservative friends. They are told to shut up if they know what’s best for them by their black counterparts. It’s not black business owners. Their property does not mean anything. It’s not blacks who fought in the military. Their statues are destroyed by the black lives matter protesters with disdain. So which black lives matter again?
Black Lives Matter. Of course they do! Then when multiple black police officers and individuals were killed during the “peaceful protests”. I don’t see any outrage? Black individually owned businesses burned to the ground. Silence. Deadliest weekend in Chicago. NOTHING!!
I can’t keep up. I just can’t. I’m exhausted trying to figure out what we’re all supposed to do, believe, and be offended and outraged by next.
Two months ago, First Responders were all the rage. In fact, they were heroes. We gave them free coffee, meals, and cheers as they drove by. Today, we hate them and want them defunded because they can’t be trusted.
Two months ago, truck drivers were the heroes, as well, for keeping America moving and the grocery stores stocked. Today we block the roads with protesters, drag them out of the cabs and beat them half to death.
Nurses and Doctors are still cool for now. But they may be unemployed. They too are heroes, unless of course they truly believe all lives matter. Then they’re filled with hate and are part of problem like so many others.
Just 45 days ago protests weren’t “essential” and were considered criminal, selfish and a murderous activity. Today they are gloriously critical and celebrated. All of the obvious criminal and murderous activities are simply ignored. If you protest about lock downs for freedom, you are selfish and you will spread a virus. If you protest, loot, and riot for social justice, you are a warrior and the virus fades to the background.
Trust the experts. No, not those experts. Don’t wear masks ... wear masks, but only good ones. Wait, don’t wear masks, wear anything as a mask. Never mind on the masks. Not sure, but if you don’t, you hate people because you could be an asymptomatic spreader. Wait. That's not a thing anymore?
For 3 months, NOTHING was more important than social distance. In fact, we gave up all of our liberties for it. We canceled schools, medical and dental procedures, yet allowed the murder of babies, canceled activities, closed businesses, eliminated every spring rite of passage from prom to graduation, denied people funerals, even at Arlington, and we wrecked the economy for it. Then came social justice, and social distance was no more. Now things are more cut and dried though. A thousand people at three memorials for someone they never even met. It's a matter of ""respect"". But you can only assemble 100 or less people.
I’m really confused now. Look at the data, NO, not that data. Do the math. No, you can’t do the math like that. Only the experts can understand the data and math. What do you mean other cities/states/governors are interpreting the data differently? Pools are safe in Indiana, but not Michigan? Playgrounds are safe in your town but not mine? Amusement parks are safe in Florida but not Ohio, nor Michigan.
If you are silent you are part of the problem. If you speak, you are part of the problem. If you have to ask, you don’t understand. If you don’t ask, you don’t care.
It’s all so predictable, tedious, and exhausting. Nothing adds up. It’s one gigantic Math life problem, with ever changing denominators that I’m sure the media and politicians are eagerly ready to solve for us...until the next ""crisis"".
So, for now I pray. I pray God will heal our land and bless the United States of America! Bless us with Wisdom, Kindness, Gentleness, Mercy, Love, Peace and Healing. Things that Really Matter! We all Matter in God's Eyes!"

“Tell school administrators about any extra supplies your child may need to safely make it through a night away from home,” the CDC wrote to parents in their advisory. “Bring extra medicines, special foods, or supplies your child would need if separated overnight.
“Complete a backpack card and tuck one in your child’s backpack and your wallet,” they added.
At the same time, Ohio is taking measures to create isolation camps with assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that can house COVID-19 patients in certain instances.
Ohio Department of Health (ODH) Interim Director Lance Himes issued a state-wide order on Aug. 31 enacting these camps to house people who “are unable to safely self-quarantine in their place of residence and to isolate those diagnosed with or showing symptoms of COVID-19.”
The Ohio camps will be used to house people who “test positive for COVID-19 who do not require hospitalization but need isolation (including those exiting from hospitals); those who have been exposed to COVID-19 who do not require hospitalization; and asymptomatic high-risk individuals needing social distancing as a precautionary measure.”
Dan Tierney, who works as the press secretary to Ohio’s Republican Governor Mike DeWine, downplayed any worries about the FEMA camps being erected throughout the state.
“The order gives the state of Ohio the ability to draw down federal funding to reimburse the local EMA and health department when a non-congregate shelter is needed. These shelters are used when an individual is unable to safely quarantine or isolate in their home,” he said during a press conference.
“The nature of these shelters is no different than what the EMA and others stand-up during natural disasters. The intent of the order is to provide a safe and healthy space for the individual who needs to be quarantined or isolated as determined by local needs. This also helps protect family members from exposure. FEMA has FAQ’s and more information available,” Tierney continued.
“As determined by local needs’ remains ambiguous as an answer to the question of who decides whether a person’s residence is safe,” he added.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_Social media_141873,"Here’s How Joe Biden is Cheating (And It’s Not a Teleprompter)

Color me surprised. I’ve been predicting for months now that Joe Biden would bail out on the debates, due to his inability to string two sentences together without a teleprompter. But it now looks like Biden will attend the first debate tomorrow night. His team has figured out a technological workaround to help control him in public appearances and keep up the charade that Biden has most of his faculties.

After all the years that I worked in TV news, I’m kind of kicking myself that I didn’t spot this trick earlier. Keep in mind that Democrats are willing to do just about anything to cheat in a presidential election. This includes grade-school level cheating, such as then DNC head honcho Donna Brazile handing CNN’s debate questions to Hillary Clinton prior to the debate. But it also includes much more sophisticated, technological methods.

Think back to the first debate in 2016 between Trump and Crooked Hillary. That’s the debate where she wore the red pantsuit that she stole from Kim Jong Un’s wardrobe. Literally everyone on the right noticed the square box under Hillary’s jacket that was taped to her back, and the wires running up toward her head.

The device sparked a lot of theories about what it was, with some thinking it was some type of medical device to control Hillary’s seizures. But having worked in TV for so many years, I instantly recognized it, because I used to wear one at work every day. It was a power source and wireless receiver for Hillary’s IFB (her earpiece). Someone within close enough proximity was able to relay information to Hillary during the debates to make it look like she just has so many obscure facts and figures floating around in her big brain.

The funny thing is: Trump knew. If you re-watch that first debate, when Trump shakes Hillary’s hand at the very beginning, he reaches over with his left hand and taps Hillary on the back – directly on the wires. He was signaling to her, “I know you’re cheating, you wretched villain, but I’m going to beat you anyway.”


After that first debate, the media went out of its way to not do any close-ups on Hillary from behind, because everyone knew she was wearing a gadget to help her cheat.

Fast forward to 2020, and here is how Joe Biden’s team plans to cheat. They’ve already tested this method out in several public appearances. Is Joe Biden using a teleprompter part of the time? Yes, absolutely. We’ve all seen it. He’s using handwritten notes, a teleprompter, his computer screen and any other resource they can to prop him up and make it look like he’s not a really old man with really bad Alzheimer’s.

But this… this is an inspired piece of evil genius. This is going to sound like something out of a science fiction movie but bear with me. This is totally real, and I’ll prove it to you.

Joe Biden has a medical device implanted in his skull.

It’s called the Esteem Hearing Implant which you can learn about HERE. It’s an implant that goes into the skull above the ear and it has two micro-wire probes that are injected into the nerves inside the ear canal. It’s FDA-approved and it uses bone conduction to enhance hearing (sound waves vibrate off the bones of the skull, and the wire probes send the signal directly into the ear, basically). It’s wireless and it’s controlled by the push of a button, so the user can turn it on and off with a little device… that fits in your pocket.

And that’s how the experts at Bombards Body Language spotted this trick. Joe Biden gets really addled during unscripted, public appearances and interviews. It happened during the CNN Town Hall recently. When someone starts talking to Joe Biden, there are times when he gets that “addled old man” expression of sheer terror and confusion on his face. He’s totally lost and doesn’t have a clue where he is or what’s happening.

But then – every single time – Joe Biden does what he’s been trained to do in these situations. His right hand goes into his pocket. Then he smiles that big Joe Biden politician smile that we all recognize after 47 years of this guy being in office. Then he answers the question.

When Joe Biden gets confused, he reaches into his pocket and turns on the implant. Whoever is talking to him on the other end instructs him to smile and then starts relaying answers to him until he gets back on track. Joe hears it because the implant receives a wireless signal and vibrates the bones in his skull.

The body language experts have also noticed that whenever Biden is receiving instructions through the implant, he cannot make eye contact with the person asking him a question. This is a natural response. Even a young, healthy and spry young mind like Donald Trump’s cannot receive communication input from two sources at once. Joe Biden has to look away from the speaker in order to listen to his handlers, which is why he always looks down when he’s being asked a question. He’s not thinking or listening intently; he’s receiving instructions from his handlers on which set of talking points to rattle off.

Now we know. And now you know what to watch for during the debates. If Joe Biden looks terrorized and completely lost and confused, he’ll reach into his pocket to turn on his skull implant and then he’ll smile. Every time. We also know why Joe Biden completely vanished from the campaign trail during July. He wasn’t just hiding in his basement. He was getting his implant installed and recovering from surgery."

Dear *******,
I want to provide you some very important information. I'm a committee member within the Liberal Party of Canada. I sit within several committee groups but the information I am providing is originating from the Strategic Planning committee (which is steered by the PMO).
I need to start off by saying that I'm not happy doing this but I have to. As a Canadian and more importantly as a parent who wants a better future not only for my children but for other children as well. The other reason I am doing this is because roughly 30% of the committee members are not pleased with the direction this will take Canada, but our opinions have been ignored and they plan on moving forward toward their goals. They have also made it very clear that nothing will stop the planned outcomes.
The road map and aim was set out by the PMO and is as follows:
- Phase in secondary lock down restrictions on a rolling basis, starting with major metropolitan areas first and expanding outward. Expected by November 2020.
- Rush the acquisition of (or construction of) isolation facilities across every province and territory. Expected by December 2020.
- Daily new cases of COVID-19 will surge beyond capacity of testing, including increases in COVID related deaths following the same growth curves. Expected by end of November 2020.
- Complete and total secondary lock down (much stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions). Expected by end of December 2020 - early January 2021
- Reform and expansion of the unemployment program to be transitioned into the universal basic income program. Expected by Q1 2021.
- Projected COVID-19 mutation and/or co-infection with secondary virus (referred to as COVID-21) leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection. Expected by February 2021.
- Daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical care facilities capacity. Expected Q1 - Q2 2021.
- Enhanced lock down restrictions (referred to as Third Lock Down) will be implemented. Full travel restrictions will be imposed (including inter-province and inter-city). Expected Q2 2021.
- Transitioning of individuals into the universal basic income program. Expected mid Q2 2021.
- Projected supply chain break downs, inventory shortages, large economic instability. Expected late Q2 2021.
- Deployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints. Restrict travel and movement. Provide logistical support to the area. Expected by Q3 2021.
Along with that provided road map the Strategic Planning committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning Canadians to meet a unprecedented economic endeavor. One that would change the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians.
What we were told was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on a international scale, that the federal government was going to offer Canadians a total debt relief.
This is how it works: the federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts (mortgages, loans, credit cards, etc) which all funding will be provided
to Canada by the IMF under what will become known as the World Debt Reset program.
In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever.
The individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which would provide the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living even under a full lock down (through the use of photo identification referred to as Canada's HealthPass) .
Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told ""the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details"".
Several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset program, or the HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling. Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we came up with a plan to ensure that would never happen. We were told it was in the individuals best interest to participate.
When several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer we were told that those who refused would first live under the lock down restrictions indefinitely.
And that over a short period of time as more Canadians transitioned into the debt forgiveness program, the ones who refused to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities. Once in those facilities they would be given two options, participate in the debt forgiveness program and be released, or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under the classification of a serious public health risk and have all their assets seized.
So as you can imagine after hearing all of this it turned into quite the heated discussion and escalated beyond anything I've ever witnessed before.
In the end it was implied by the PMO that the whole agenda will move forward no matter who agrees with it or not.
That it wont just be Canada but in fact all nations will have similar roadmaps and agendas. That we need to take advantage of the situations before us to promote change on a grander scale for the betterment of everyone. The members who were opposed and ones who brought up key issues that would arise from such a thing were completely ignored. Our opinions and concerns were ignored. We were simply told to just do it.
All I know is that I don't like it and I think its going to place Canadians into a dark future."
Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_783313,"Why does it look like the state is testing at only a quarter of its lab capacity?
Why does it look like Wisconsin’s positive test rate has exploded?
Is DHS making a simple math error?
Is DHS throwing away hundreds of thousands of negative test results to make its math work?
Is the Evers Administration making key decisions using bad math?

A fundamental flaw in how the Evers’ Administration calculates Wisconsin’s daily COVID-19 positive test rate has excluded hundreds of thousands of test results and led to a wildly distorted picture of the state’s progress in confronting the virus.

The positive test rate is important, because it is one of six gating criteria the Evers’ Administration uses to make public health policy decisions that affect the entire state. Specifically, the requirement is for the “Downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period.”

Throughout August and September, Wisconsin’s positive test rate steadily increased from a weekly average of 6.2% to 19% (as of Sep. 21st).

The number of new people with a positive test result each day is less important, but gets more attention. That’s not surprising because the Department of Health Services (DHS) posts the number of new positive cases each day prominently at the top of its summary dashboard, while one must hunt for the actual test rate on the page.

As the test rate has steadily ticked up over the past two months, Wisconsin has had five record setting days for the number of new positive cases. Most of the increase has occurred among the 18-24 age group and is tied to college campuses. That’s where public officials are now focusing their efforts, but not every reporter has forgotten the importance of the rate.

“What’s behind the rise in percent positive rates?” Wispolitics’ Stephanie Hoff bluntly asked Dr. Ryan Westergaard, Wisconsin’s Chief Medical Officer on Sep. 15th. 

This systematic error means DHS is tossing hundreds of thousands of negative test results when calculating the positive test rate. The real rate could be half of what DHS claims.

“Well, it’s a ratio so it has two components: the numerator – the top number of course is the number of positive cases,” he replied. “The bottom number of the ratio is the denominator. That’s the number of people that have been tested overall.”

This was an incredible admission. If the goal is to calculate the daily positive test rate, then DHS is using the wrong numerator and denominator. What they’re actually calculating is the daily percentage of new COVID-19 cases among those who have never been tested before – a fairly meaningless statistic. It is not the positive test rate.

On that same day, Sep. 15th, DHS recorded the rate as 11%. That was calculated by comparing 1,352 new cases to 12,266 new people tested. However, there were almost 20,000 tests collected that day. If DHS compared that day’s number of positive tests to the total number of test results, the rate would have been much lower – possibly as low as 6.7%. They’ve been making this same mistake since the spring.

This systematic error means DHS is tossing hundreds of thousands of negative test results when calculating the positive test rate. The real rate could be half of what DHS claims.

Origin of the Error

When it first started collecting COVID-19 data, DHS recognized that people were getting tested multiple times. Some people tested positive for the virus one week, and then still had it when they were retested a week later. If the department wasn’t careful, it might be accidentally counting single cases of COVID-19 over and over, and include them in the official tally. That would inflate Wisconsin’s total COVID-19 cases – a mistake that surely would be caught.

The department decided on a data collection method that would pick and choose which test results to use. Dr. Westergaard explained the reasoning during a June 11th press conference.

“Our data reports individuals tested. So, if an individual is tested more than once because they were being followed to see if they cleared the infection or if they were tested a couple times weeks apart, they would be considered a single case and not multiple cases in our data,” Westergaard explained.

DHS acknowledges this method on its data summary dashboard. The fine print plainly states “Multiple tests per person are not included in these summary statistics.”

And so, every day DHS compares the number of new COVID-19 cases to the number of people who were tested for the first time to determine the positive test rate. Under this method, it throws away the results for everyone that has ever been tested before. That means every day thousands of negative test results are not included in the rate calculation. 

DHS has discarded hundreds of thousands of results since it began reporting COVID-19 data. Most people who are tested for COVID-19 receive negative test results.

As the pool of people who have never been tested before continues to shrink, the number of negative results getting tossed will naturally increase. Subsequently the positive test rate will continue to artificially rise.

Scope of the Error

Each day’s positive test rate needs to be calculated using all the test results from that day. Only DHS can correct this error, because only it has access to all the test results.

Although DHS’ website is filled with all kinds of COVID-19 related data – it does not post the total number of test results it receives each day. However, it does report the number of total tests collected by health care professionals across the state each day. That figure cannot be used to calculate the daily rate, because there is a lag from the time a test is collected and when the results come back.

Each day’s positive test rate needs to be calculated using all the test results from that day.
However, we can still get a good look at the problem using weekly averages.

Altogether, there have been approximately 2.1 million tests, 1.4 million people tested, and 101,321 positive cases (as of Sep. 20th). Using DHS’ flawed methodology, officials have tossed around 600,000 test results in calculating the daily positive test rate. That results in an overall rate of 7%, while the real rate could be as low as 4.8%.

That might not seem like a big difference overall. However, public officials aren’t looking at the big picture. They’re looking at this rate on a day-to-day basis, and only 14 days back. The inherent flaws in DHS’ formula means the difference between the official rate and the real rate consistently grows.

When DHS first began collecting COVID-19 data, no one had been tested before, and few results were discarded. At that time, the rate calculated by DHS would have been fairly accurate.

However, as time goes on, more and more people are re-tested. That means more and more results are thrown out. Inevitably the rate will become more and more inaccurate unless DHS corrects its calculations.

Testing Capacity

The cracks in DHS’ methodology are beginning to show.

The Evers Administration is increasingly confronted with questions it cannot answer (even when the answers are right on DHS’ website).

For example, some reporters have noticed that the state’s lab capacity is much higher than – what they believe to be – the number of new test results each day.

In August, lab capacity was around 26,000 tests a day, and an average of 15,600 test were administered each day. That meant labs were running at about 60% capacity. In September, lab capacity increased to 38,000 tests a day, and an average of 20,685 tests were administered each day. That meant labs were running at about 54% capacity. However, the way DHS presents its data could lead some to believe there are only around 10,000 tests being administered each day – or about 26 – 38%.

“Why do we continue to be at a quarter the rate of testing capacity? Is it a shortage of supplies or people just not getting tested?” a reporter asked Palm at a press conference on Sep. 16th.

“This is certainly a complicated question and therefor a complicated answer and some of it is just speculation,” Palm replied.

Clearly, the reporter was confused or did not realize that the number of new people being tested is different from the number of tests being collected. Palm had the opportunity to correct this confusion, but she either didn’t listen to the question or doesn’t understand the issue herself.

Even Dr. Westergaard, who has repeatedly demonstrated his understanding of what data is available and how the rate is calculated, has yet to point out the complete truth of these fundamental issues.

That reporter is not the first one to ask why test numbers always appear to be well below the state’s capacity. Once reporters begin to understand the difference between individuals tested and the number of tests actually collected, they will be able to identify the bad math DHS uses to calculate Wisconsin’s rate. They will then be able to ask why the state is making public policy decisions based on this bad math.

Whether or not the Evers Administration or the Capitol press corps figure this out on their own eventually won’t matter. As the number of new individuals getting tested continues to drop, the day will come when there are more positive test results than new individuals being tested. Once the daily positive test rate rises above 100%, no one will be able to ignore the math any longer.

Solving the Problem

DHS was right to take steps to ensure its total case count was accurate, but the positive test rate is just as important.

DHS should also calculate the positive test rate every day using all the results from that day. Since no one is tested twice in the same day, this will ensure that each day’s rate is accurate. That will ensure the gating requirement is reflecting the correct data.

This is something DHS could start doing today. It needs to start doing this today, because it’s current method is producing inaccurate results – which the Evers Administration continues to use in its gating criteria to make pivotal public policy decisions that affect everyone in Wisconsin.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_954506,"If you vote for tyrants, you get tyranny. This is what millions of Joe Biden supporters are about to discover if their candidate manages to steal the election and seize control of the White House. A prominent member of Biden's Covid-19 taskforce, a CIA-linked operative named Luciana Borio, says that people who refuse to be vaccinated should be deprived of food stamps and rent assistance. And in order to convince Black Americans to take the vaccines, influencers should be hired to brainwash Blacks with special compliance messages that are scientifically tested in social engineering focus groups. In other words, obey or starve. This is all contained in the report linked in this story, by the way. This is on top of another Biden taskforce member now calling for a 4-6 week national lockdown for all Americans -- a kind of national economic suicide to finish off whatever small businesses might have survived the covid nightmare so far. This covid tyranny is exactly what we've warned was coming: Lockdown tyranny and vaccine tyranny, enforced through a horrifying new ""medical credit scoring"" system that tracks your compliance with government mandates for vaccines, lockdowns and masks. The taskforce member in question here is Luciana Borio, MD, the Vice President of In-Q-Tel, a CIA-linked propaganda front that uses social engineering tactics to enslave humanity. She's listed as the top member of the ""Working Group of Readying Populations for COVID-19 Vaccines"" as described in a document from the Center for Health Security, released in July of this year by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. A copy of this PDF has been saved at the Natural News servers, in case they try to take it down from its original location. The document says that federal agencies should collude to develop a ""national promotion strategy"" -- which might as well be called a ""national propaganda strategy"" -- for convincing people to take potentially dangerous and deadly covid-19 vaccines which have skipped any real rigorous testing.
""Bundling"" of vaccinations with food stamps, health care and rent assistance

The document recommends that vaccine mandates get ""bundled"" with other social services such as food stamps (WIC program), rent assistance and health care services. The report explains: Local and state public health agencies should explore collaboration with interagency and nongovernment partners to bundle vaccination with other safety net services. It also says that ""bundling"" vaccines with food stamps would be, ""a way to build trust and streamline vaccine provision"" among low-income people such as ""Blacks and minority communities."" Yes, just as we've all known for quite some time, the depopulation vaccines will be targeting Blacks in America, which is exactly what the abortion industry targets as well. But anyone who criticizes the forcing of vaccines onto Black Americans will be called racist, of course. The report also talks about putting in place a medical police state monitoring infrastructure to surveil Blacks and minorities in real time, making sure they surrender to forced immunizations: It will also be critical to monitor in real time who has gotten the vaccine and what the key facilitators and barriers to vaccination have been within communities, so local public health departments can adapt their approaches accordingly. The document even talks about Blacking-up the vaccine propaganda language in order to appeal to Blacks and so-called anti-vaxxers: Given the diverse nature of social identities in the United States, vaccination communications will need to be tailored to specific audiences that are key to an equitable and effective COVID-19 response (eg, essential workers, parents, groups with high comorbidity rates, communities of color, vaccine-hesitant persons). In order to brainwash Blacks and minorities into accepting dangerous, experimental covid-19 vaccines, document authors say that influential celebrities (such as Hollywood stars and music stars) should be recruited to deliver messages so that uninformed people can be influenced: Engage a broad network of trusted spokespersons who can deliver and reinforce a unified message about COVID-19 vaccination...  To motivate people to take protective actions like vaccination requires that they hear a salient and specific message repeatedly, delivered by multiple trusted messengers and via diverse media channels. The report even admits that Blacks and minorities have been lied to and abused by the government before, especially involving public health issues: ""...minority groups have often experienced a history of government abuse that may make it harder build trust."" Finally, the document proposes that scientific testing on ""vaccination messages"" should be openly published by the NIH, CDC and NLM (National Library of Medicine) so that all the authorities have access to all the social engineering experiments that attempt to brainwash Blacks with pro-vaccine propaganda.
Mandatory vaccine sites: Grocery stores, pharmacies, schools, workplaces, senior citizen centers and churches will all be used to force vaccines on everyone

The document not only recommends that food assistance and rent assistance be withheld from those who refuse mandatory coronavirus vaccines, it also says that ""home visits"" should be used to inject people on a door-to-door basis. In addition, workplaces, pharmacies, churches and schools are named as candidates for forced immunizations, and the document recommends that pharmacists be allowed to ""administer a vaccine directly without a standing order."" The document specifically states that vaccine efforts should include ""nontraditional sites"" such as ""places of worship"" or senior centers, and that covid-19 vaccines should be ""bundled"" wit` other essential social services such as food stamps (see below). From the document: (emphasis added) COVID-19 vaccination may require ramping up the use of sites that are already available and accessible to older adults butare used less frequently; widely placed community pharmacies, for example, are an underutilized site for routine vaccine promotion and administration,111 but they were used successfully for expanding access to pandemic vaccine in 2009 and 2010.112 Most adults in the United States live closer to a pharmacy than to a clinic, and pharmacy vaccination programs can be especially effective for harder-to-reach populations. Pharmacy immunization efforts work best when pharmacists are given adequate training in administering a new vaccine and when state-level policies allow pharmacists the ability to administer a vaccine directly without a standing order. Other nontraditional vaccination settings include grocery stores, senior citizen centers, health departments, mass vaccination clinics, and local corporations; these have been assessed as safe and acceptable sites for pneumococcal and influenza vaccines.113-115 After doctors’ offices, the next most common settings for influenza vaccination are pharmacies, stores (eg, supermarkets), and workplaces.116 To allow adults to be vaccinated directly in their workplaces seems prudent, especially for essential workers likely to be in the first tier for vaccination. Schools, which are trusted institutions present in every community and available on weekends and at night, are an additional candidate location; they were used during mass polio vaccination campaigns.117 In some cases, it also may be acceptable and feasible to deliver vaccination via home visits by community health nurses when vaccination is bundled with delivery of other preventive health services; this approach has received a strong recommendation in the past from the Community Preventive Services Task Force.118 Ensuring that all COVID-19 vaccination sites maintain safe physical distancing practices may require additional planning. The report also urges vaccine pushers to plan for the ""logistics"" of using grocery stores as ""frontline"" sites in a ""vaccine rollout."" Here's the text from the report: Federal, state, and local health officers and their strategic partners should actively involve experts on preparedness and planning in vaccine rollout preparations as early as possible, given that novel or nontraditional sites for vaccination may become the frontlines of a successful vaccination program. These experts can help coordinate efforts at heterogeneous sites and adapt strategies that suit each site accordingly. For example, the vaccination logistics and rollout at a grocery store site will require different planning and preparation than vaccine rollout in traditional physicians’ offices.
Get ready for the rolling out of an Orwellian medical police state run by fascist vaccine pushers and Big Tech censors

The bottom line in all this? If Biden is elected President and his covid-19 taskforce becomes a reality, America will be transformed into a vaccine-pushing medical police state where you can't even go to the grocery store or go to church without being harassed by crazed vaccine zealots. All independent journalism that questions the safety or efficacy of vaccines will be completely banned, and the CDC -- using taxpayer money -- will roll out an endless stream of pro-vaccine propaganda by hiring famous actors and recording artists to brainwash the masses into getting vaccinated. This is what happens when you vote for tyrants: You get tyranny. So roll up your sleeve, Biden supporters, and prepare to be forcibly injected with an experimental, potentially deadly vaccine cocktail that will make the Tuskegee experiments look like a cakewalk. Blacks and minorities are about to be targeted with the ultimate depopulation weapon: An engineered euthanasia shot called a ""vaccine,"" that's so deadly and dangerous, every propaganda trick imaginable has to be used to convince people to take it... even when it's free. And if you say no, you won't be able to buy groceries, go to church, attend a concert, travel by air or even open a bank account. If you continue to resist, don't worry: They'll send ""isolation teams"" to your home to kidnap you and throw you in a CDC concentration camp, where you'll be ""recycled"" into biosludge that's deposited onto the food crops. It sounds a lot like the Green New Deal, doesn't it? Except it's actually the Green New KILL. Welcome to Covid-1984."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_652419,"On the morning of November 4th President Trump delivered an election speech to the nation.
President Trump was VERY positive with the election results has he set new records in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

In Wisconsin President Trump was ahead by 120,000 votes.

President Trump warned Americans to watch out for suspicious late night ballot drops.

Then this happened…
After telling the world that they were stopping counting overnight, the Democrats suddenly dropped over 300,000 ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan.

At 3 AM Central time (an hour after President Trump’s speech) Joe Biden overcame a 4.1% Trump lead.
The media reported the next day that Wisconsin, thanks to Milwaukee, had a 89% turnout — something that is unheard of in the US.
Now we are putting together how this all happened.
The Milwaukee Elections Chief lost a flash drive on the way to the county election commission.

Via Wisconsin Right Now:

A flash drive that contained crucial absentee voter information in the 2020 presidential election was briefly lost during the early morning hours of Wednesday Nov. 4 as the world waited for Milwaukee to reveal its ballot counts.

Sources within Milwaukee County law enforcement told Wisconsin Right Now exclusively that the executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, Claire Woodall-Vogg, realized she had lost the flash drive when she left, with police escort, the Central Count building where ballots were tallied. She was en route to the county courthouse to report “the results of more than 169,000 absentee ballots collected in the City of Milwaukee,” the Hill previously reported.

There’s more…
Reporters actually FILMED Milwaukee Election Commission Senior Executive Claire Woodall-Vogg feeding totals into a machine in the wee hours of the morning WITHOUT any election observers!
This was ALL CAUGHT ON VIDEO!

Woodall-Vogg purposely broke all protocol by transferring numbers to a flash drive at the Milwaukee center.

(1/3) Claire Woodall-Vogg penned a letter on November 9, 2020 about the transferring of paper ballots to flash drives; however, it is against Wisconsin Election Law to break the legal chain of custody in reporting the tabulated votes, and thus use of Flash Drives is 100% ILLEGAL: pic.twitter.com/Ab9tiT30Vi

More from Wisconsin Right Now:

Three days after this story first ran, Woodall-Vogg wrote a letter to the Wisconsin Election Commission in which she explained her side of what happened. In the letter, she admitted that, when she got to Milwaukee County with the flash drives, she couldn’t find one of them. She says the flash drive was sitting in a tabulator machine, a senior staff member removed the flash drive and turned it over to a Milwaukee police officer who then delivered it to her 10 minutes later. She alleges that the incident did not alter the results of the election and that the District Attorney’s office conducted an investigation to establish chain of custody.

Calls and emails for comment were also made to Mayor Tom Barrett’s office, and the Milwaukee County Election Commission. There have been no responses at all. Our sources did not want to be named for fear of retaliation, although they are in a position to know the information they imparted; such is the urgency behind the scenes over the matter.

The indictment lists only on the criminal activity Soros participated in prior to the November election, such as wire fraud, identity theft, aiding and abetting, and damage to computers.
The FBI stated that the indictment will likely be updated to reflect election interference charges in relation to Dominion Voting, once the full scale of Soros’ operations has been exposed. Soros is currently being interrogated by the FBI.

It is also notable that the judge put a publication ban on Soros’ arrest, however these laws are not enforceable with non-US media.
Rebel News – a renowned alternative media outlet – previously reported on the connection between George Soros, the Tides Foundation, and Dominion Voting.
According to reporter Keean Bexte,
Bexte has provided evidence that suggests George Soros may have had a bigger role in the US election than previously thought.

The FBI have confirmed they are aware of Soros’ operations in Canada, and have executed a search warrant on Soros’ home and offices in Toronto.

The Criminal Complaint containing the charge was unsealed this morning.

Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney for the District of Hawaii Kenji M. Price, Assistant Director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division Alan E. Kohler Jr., and Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Honolulu Field Office Eli S. Miranda made the announcement.

The judge has imposed a “media blackout”, but Canadian outlets like Conservative Beaver are not subject to those rules. Other Canadian and Spanish-language outlets have already reported on this development.
The story was originally reported on in Mexico. The story originated on lesser-known forums. Bits and pieces of evidence regarding Obama’s recent arrest were leaked to the Darkweb before making it to the Clearweb. Celebrities and influencers soon began spreading the reports on Twitter.

“The trail of Chinese espionage is long and, sadly, strewn with former American intelligence officers who betrayed their colleagues, their country and its liberal democratic values to support an authoritarian communist regime,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.  “This betrayal is never worth it.  Whether immediately, or many years after they thought they got away with it, we will find these traitors and we will bring them to justice.  To the Chinese intelligence services, these individuals are expendable.  To us, they are sad but urgent reminders of the need to stay vigilant.”

YouTube Influencers all over the globe have been reporting on the arrest

 “The charges announced today are a sobering reminder to our communities in Hawaii of the constant threat posed by those who seek to jeopardize our nation’s security through acts of espionage,” said U.S. Attorney Price. “Of particular concern are the criminal acts of those who served in our nation’s intelligence community, but then choose to betray their former colleagues and the nation-at large by divulging classified national defense information to China. My office will continue to tenaciously pursue espionage cases.”

“This serious act of espionage is another example in a long string of illicit activities that the​People’s Republic of China is conducting within and against the United States,” said Alan E. Kohler Jr., Assistant Director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division.  “This case demonstrates that no matter the length or difficulty of the investigation, the men and women of the FBI will work tirelessly to protect our national security from the threat posed by Chinese intelligence services.  Let it be known that anyone who violates a position of trust to betray the United States will face justice, no matter how many years it takes to bring their crimes to light.”

“These cases are very complicated and take years if not decades to bring to a conclusion,” said Eli Miranda, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Honolulu Division.  “I could not be more proud of the work done by the men and women of the FBI’s Honolulu Division in pursuing this case. Their dedication is a reminder that the FBI will never waiver when it comes to ensuring the safety and security of our nation.”

Obama’s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.

Self-described “fact-checkers” from Reuters and the Associated Press have been trying to ascertain the validity of Obama’s arrest. Many describe liberal fact-checkers as “deep state assets” and accuse them of intentionally spreading disinformation to mislead the public.

It is important to note, due to the media blackout, American journalists are forbidden from reporting on Obama’s arrest. It appears these “journalists” didn’t get the memo.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_Social media_643029,"Repost from a registered nurse: “If you are thinking about getting a Covid vaccination, I hope you read this first! If you're going to inject something into your body, do it with your eyes open. Do your own research if necessary, but at least be informed!
Below are the thoughts of Frank Schallenberger, MD regarding the Covid 19 vaccine.
Dear Patients and friends,
Last week I must have been asked 20 times about the new COVID vaccines. Here are my thoughts. Please pass this informatiion onto many as you can. People need to have fully informed consent when it comes to injecting foreign genetic material into their bodies.
1. The COVID vaccines are mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines are a completely new type of vaccine. No mRNA vaccine has ever been licensed for human use before. In essence, we have absolutely no idea what to expect from this vaccine. We have no idea if it will be effective or safe.
2. Traditional vaccine simply introduce pieces of a virus to stimulate an immune reaction. The new mRNA vaccine is completely different. It actually injects (transfects) molecules of synthetic genetic material from non-humans sources into our cells. Once in the cells, the genetic material interacts with our transfer RNA (tRNA) to make a foreign protein that supposedly teaches the body to destroy the virus being coded for. Note that these newly created proteins are not regulated by our own DNA, and are thus completely foreign to our cells. What they are fully capable of doing is unknown.
3. The mRNA molecule is vulnerable to destruction. So, in order to protect the fragile mRNA strands while they are being inserted into our DNA they are coated with PEGylated lipid nanoparticles. This coating hides the mRNA from our immune system which ordinarily would kill any foreign material injected into the body. PEGylated lipid nanoparticles have been used in several different drugs for years. Because of their effect on immune system balance, several studies have shown them to induce allergies and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, PEGylated lipid nanoparticles have been shown to trigger their own immune reactions, and to cause damage to the liver.
4. These new vaccines are additionally contaminated with aluminum, mercury, and possibly formaldehyde. The manufacturers have not yet disclosed what other toxins they contain.
5. Since viruses mutate frequently, the chance of any vaccine working for more than a year is unlikely. That is why the flu vaccine changes every year. Last year’s vaccine is no more valuable than last year’s newspaper.
6. Absolutely no long term safety studies will have been done to ensure that any of these vaccines don’t cause the cancer, seizures, heart disease, allergies, and autoimmune diseases seen with other vaccines. If you ever wanted to be guinea pig for Big Pharma, now is your golden opportunity.
7. Many experts question whether the mRNA technology is ready for prime time. In November 2020, Dr. Peter Jay Hotez said of the new mRNA vaccines, ""I worry about innovation at the expense of practicality because they [the mRNA vaccines] are weighted toward technology platforms that have never made it to licensure before.” Dr. Hotez is Professor of Pediatrics and Molecular Virology & Microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine, where he is also Director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development.
8. Michal Linial, PhD is a Professor of Biochemistry. Because of her research and forecasts on COVID-19, Dr. Linial has been widely quoted in the media. She recently stated, ""I won't be taking it [the mRNA vaccine] immediately – probably not for at least the coming year. We have to wait and see whether it really works. We will have a safety profile for only a certain number of months, so if there is a long-term effect after two years, we cannot know.""
9. In November 2020, The Washington Post reported on hesitancy among healthcare professionals in the United States to the mRNA vaccines, citing surveys which reported that: ""some did not want to be in the first round, so they could wait and see if there are potential side effects"", and that ""doctors and nurses want more data before championing vaccines to end the pandemic"".
10. Since the death rate from COVID resumed to the normal flu death rate way back in early September, the pandemic has been over since then. Therefore, at this point in time no vaccine is needed. The current scare tactics regarding “escalating cases” is based on a PCR test that because it exceeds 34 amplifications has a 100% false positive rate unless it is performed between the 3rd and 5th day after the first day of symptoms. It is therefor 100% inaccurate in people with no symptoms. This is well established in the scientific literature. If you go to the CDC site you can see that the weekly death rates in the US are now lower than they normally are during an average flu season.
11. The other reason you don’t need a vaccine for COVID-19 is that substantial herd immunity has already taken place in the United States. This is the primary reason for the end of the pandemic.
12. Unfortunately, you cannot completely trust what you hear from the media. They have consistently got it wrong for the past year. Since they are all supported by Big Pharma and the other entities selling the COVID vaccines, they are not going to be fully forthcoming when it comes to mRNA vaccines. Every statement I have made here is fully backed by published scientific references.
13. I would be very interested to see verification that Bill and Melinda Gates with their entire family including grandchildren, Joe Biden and President Trump and their entire families, and Anthony Fauci and his entire family all get the vaccine.
14. Anyone who after reading all this still wants to get injected with the mRNA vaccine, should at the very least have their blood checked for COVID-19 antibodies. There is no need for a vaccine in persons already naturally immunized.
Here's my bottom line: I would much rather get a COVID infection than get a COVID vaccine. That would be safer and more effective. I have had a number of COVID positive flu cases this year. Some were old and had health concerns. Every single one has done really well with natural therapies including ozone therapy and IV vitamin C. Just because modern medicine has no effective treatment for viral infections, doesn’t mean that there isn’t one available."""

The US election was corrupted in so many ways.

Bill Binney, of US Intel fame tweeted out a message yesterday noting that more people voted in the 2020 election nation-wide than were eligible to vote.

What Binney points out is that according to the Washington Post, 2020 had the highest voter turnout in over a century:

Of course this on its face value implies fraud since no one was excited about voting for Joe Biden, but the WaPo wouldn’t consider going there – not with their far-left extreme bias.
Binney attaches a link to the number of registered voters in the US.  We made a copy as of today and added these voters up.  When we add up the number of registered voters we obtain 213.8 million registered voters in the US as of this morning.

Using the numbers as of today, which are materially similar to Binney’s, we find a huge issue.  If we have 213.8 million registered voters in the US and 66.2% of all voters voted in the 2020 election, that equals 141.5 voters who voted in the 2020 election (Binney shows 140 million which is materially the same).
If President Trump won 74 million votes, then that leaves only 67.5 million votes remaining for Biden.  This means 13 million duplicate or made up ballots were created and counted for Biden!
This also supports our observations from the start.  Biden committed fraud in every imaginable way, but the big steal was in millions of fraudulent votes that were created to steal the election for Biden.  MILLIONS!

The results of the 2020 election at a very high level do not add up.  This is math liberals – very simple math that even liberals should be able to understand.  At a high level, the Biden camp clearly committed fraud."

Japanese investigator Misako Ganaha explained in a video interview with Epoch Times reporter Joshua Philipp on his ""Crossroads"" program that she analyzed two lengthy videos, affording two different angles of the incident near the House chamber.

One of the videos was posted by a ""Jayden X,"" who was later identified as Antifa organizer John Sullivan of Utah.

D.C. police said the unnamed officer who shot Babbitt, a 35-year-old San Diego resident, was a plainclothes Capitol Police officer.

Ganaha pointed out to that just prior to the shooting, two men who had been agitating the crowd broke the glass on a set of doors.

Immediately after the glass was broken, a shot was fired as Babbitt attempted to go through the doors.

One of the men who broke the glass can be seen going down a stairway and changing into clothing he had stored in a backback.

Ganaha, who lives in Okinawa, Japan, said it was clear to her that the two men were not Trump supporters.

She said she's seen the same Marxist ""agitate and divide"" tactics employed by leftists in her home country.

Clearly there were Trump supporters inside the Capitol building, she said, but ""the ones who were leading the crowd, or agitating the crowd, were not Trump supporters,"" she said.

""I think they had a plan.""

An important part of the tactic, she said, is for somone in collaboration with the agitators to serve as a ""witness"" to mainstream media, which tells the story ""without analyzing.""

Media simply repeats what the witness says, explained Ganaha, ""so the world does not know the truth.""

""The world is watching and we should know what the truth is,"" she told Phillip. ""And, then we can move on to what to think or what to decide, what to talk, what do next.

""We just need the truth.""

Sullivan, who posted one of the videos, told media that Antifa had organized an event at the same time and location as the pro-Trump rally.

He insisted in a video he posted Friday to Periscope that he was inside the Capitol building only ""to record.""

""I was there to let people see that situation in the best possible way,"" claimed Sullivan, the founder of a group called Insurgence USA.

He asserted in an interview with Fox 13 in Salt Lake City that his video disproves those who claim Antifa members dressed as Trump supporters invaded the Capitol.

He said he was detained and questioned by the FBI but was not charged with any crime. In June, Sullivan was arrested for organizing a protest in Provo, Utah, where a person was shot.

On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged the FBI and DHS to place everyone who invaded the Capitol on Jan. 6 on the no-fly list as ""insurrectionists.""

Military takedowns and arrests begin this wknd and will continue forward for the next 13 days/nights. Some international raids have already started. Italy has also been found complicit in our election fraud.
Everyone will be getting emergency 🆘 alerts on their phones, tv's, radios & internet. It will override all other broadcasts and could last for several hours at a time. Do not to be scared of what's coming as it is for the safety of our nation for this to unfold.
DO NOT travel to any large cities (especially Philadelphia) for the rest of the month. Military operations will be taking place in many of the major corrupt cities. People will start rioting once this intel breaks thinking Trump is a military dictator. He only has 13 days to put this dog down.
The implementation of the Insurrection Act began after the raid on the Capitol and was marked by Trump's broadcast to the people to disband and return home. This broadcast wound up being blocked, for the most part, by the media. Nevertheless, his address fulfilled the requirements to initiate the Act.
Marines and National Guard troops are being moved as needed for the riots that will start after the national release of the intel. The intel will be dropped for everyone to see and hear in loops that will be several hours long. The system was just checked by the FCC a few days ago alerting ALL media that they cannot block the flow of intel under federal regs.
Trump will be moved continuously like a chess piece from now until the 20th in order to avoid any retaliation against him and family.
Trump had to exhaust ALL other means legally before this operation could commence. He gave everyone a fair chance to come clean and they refused.
His press release of a ""smooth transition"" did not include the word, ""concede"" as he has no plans to do so. Rather, there will be a smooth transition of power to his new cabinet, staff and Vice President, General Flynn.
The rally in DC was an awesome event! The raids on the Capitol all started with BLM and Antifa members (many from the Philly area) and included Capitol police or those posing as Capitol police. Every day, new info is pouring forth to support this. They opened up the barricades and doors to the Capitol and let them in.
Also, I just got an update on the Capitol breech.
It appears there were some Special Ops members dressed as Trump supporters who went in with the crowd of protesters that were able to secure 20+ laptops w/hard drives with data regarding sex trafficking intel from both, Pelosi and Schumer's offices.

“I have invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 (Section 10 U.S. Code 13 251-255) to address the treasonous rebellion conducted by Democrat and Republican lawmakers, CCP Agents (Chinese Communist Party), FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others to dismantle the United States of America and it’s Constitution,” President Trump declared on Thursday 14 Jan. “These entities pose a direct threat to national security. I will remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies are arrested.”
President Trump invoked the Insurrection Act after another assassination attempt on him last Sat. morning 9 Jan. According to his Intel, Chinese Communist Party Agents, the FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others of the Deep State have – with the help of the Main Stream Media – long been planning to dismantle the US and it’s Constitution.
Of course, none of these treasonous acts have been reported by the corrupt Main Stream Media. Trump had evidence that the MSM was “embedded with CIA and Chinese Communist Party agents whose sole purpose was to direct public opinion toward a Deep State agenda.”
During President Trump’s four years in office he and what has been referred to as the Alliance have been fighting this Cabal – a Satan worshipping force composed of thirteen Satanist Bloodline families out of Italy, the Vatican, UK Monarchy, British M16, Chinese Communist Party, CIA, FBI, Department of Justice, Antifa, Black Lives Matter and certain Republican and Democratic Lawmakers. Another attempt on his life was the last straw.
Since that Sat. 9 Jan. the US has been under an abbreviated Martial Law with President Trump as Commander in Chief and General Flynn in charge of the Military. As such Trump has signed multiple Executive Orders that among other powers, allowed for Military arrests and Tribunals.
Soon to be acted upon were well over 222,286 sealed indictments against political and global elites filed in federal courts across the nation.

between 3 and 6 am Military vans, buses and police cars, along with a multitude of police and Military troops, were very busy at a blacked out White House.
“I just watched everyone in the White House arrested” declared an unnamed person doing one of the two videos shown below. (Video contains graphic language) https://youtu.be/ywfXNGNvvuU 

https://rumble.com/vdawtd-mass-arrest-at-the-capitol.html

Even though the Mass Media have refused to report it, the US has been functioning under Martial Law since Sat. 9 Jan. An Interim Military US Government was actually running the US and they saw President Biden as a treasonous agent. A few days before Joe Biden’s Inauguration and due to foreign interference in the 2020 Presidential Election, Trump had instigated the Insurgency Act, declared Martial Law and deferred his power to the US Military.
Early Mon. morning 25 Jan. between 3 and 6 am a blackout occurred in Washington DC around the White House. According to two separate videos taped at the scene, police and US troops were everywhere in the darkness. Military vans, buses and police cars pulled up to the White House, loaded passengers, took them down the road and across a bridge and then some vans came back empty to do a repeat.
Mustang Medic’s recording showed many buses and vans, some marked as Military, entering the Capitol grounds. Several people were taped getting out of their cars, showing IDs to guards and then walking into the grounds.

When it was over and seemingly on Q, fireworks lit up the sky. Reports from those on the ground claimed that by later that day the White House was closed up tight and remained so as of right now.

Evidently Biden’s team was not in the White House, but detained and arrested behind the scenes. The US Military was expected to have arrested Harris on charges of treason, while invoking the 25th Amendment on Biden because of his dementia and subsequent inability to hold office. (The Deep State had plans to invoke the 25th on Biden, put Harris in his place and Pelosi as VP. Not going to happen).
On Fri. 22 Jan. a Juan O Savin reported that the US Interim Military Government was about to arrest Joe Biden and his traitor Deep State politicians in DC.

A total of over 4 million people are without power tonight and will be for the next several days, some a lot longer.
Did you know weather manipulation and controlling the Jetstream has been going on for years and is not a conspiracy theory? Research cloud seeding and weather modification programs such as Harvard's Operation Solar Shield.
Joe Biden's ""Dark Winter"" statement was not a random thought, it was a foreshadow of what was to come. Texas is the only state to have its own, entirely independent electric grid separate from the rest of the United States. This is warfare, an attack on Texas by altering the Jetstream, seeding the clouds, and ultimately causing the storm that blacked out over 4 million people. Sound crazy? Too hard to believe? Believe it.
If Texas is on an independent power grid system, how did it fail? Every system has a flaw, A lot of Texas runs on wind turbines and solar power. All the wind turbines are frozen to a stop, all the solar panels are covered with ice and snow, Texas's flaw is cold weather - their biggest weakness is being used against them.
Why punish Texas? Texas can, and will secede from the United States within the next several years - they are in the process now and have been moving that direction.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_912480,"An Emergency Order from the Biden administration’s Department of Energy shows Texas energy grid operator ERCOT was instructed to stay within green energy standards by purchasing energy from outside the state at a higher cost, throttling power output throughout the state ahead of a catastrophic polar vortex.

Major smoking gun! Infowars has been sent a Department of Energy document, confirmed to be authentic, showing Texas begging for federal authorization to increase power! 

Going into effect Sunday, Feb. 14, Emergency Order 202-21-1 shows the Energy Dept. was aware of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s statewide disaster declaration and that ERCOT was readying gas utilities in preparation for a demand surge.

The order shows Acting Energy Secretary David Huizenga did not waive environmental restrictions to allow for maximum energy output, instead ordering ERCOT to utilize all resources in order to stay within acceptable emissions standards – including purchasing energy from outside the state.

“ERCOT anticipates that this Order may result in exceedance of emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide emissions, as well as wastewater release limits,” the order states. “To minimize adverse environmental impacts, this Order limits operation of dispatched units to the times and within the parameters determined by ERCOT for reliability purposes.”

Moreover, the order instructed an “incremental amount of restricted capacity” to be sold to ERCOT at “a price no lower than $1,500/MWh,” an increase of over 6,000 percent over February 2020 prices of $18.20.

On Wednesday, the Dallas Business Journal reported, “Electricity on the Texas grid has averaged about $1,137.33 per megawatt hour so far in February, up from $18.20 per megawatt hour in February 2020, according to data from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas. That’s a jump of more than 6,000 percent.”

Days later, the Public Utility Commission of Texas set prices at $9,000/MWh.

The EO shows the Biden administration basically ordered ERCOT to throttle its energy output by forcing it to comply with environmental green energy standards, while knowing full well Texans could freeze to death in their homes with zero electricity as temperatures plunged into the single digits.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_473743,"The chant “lock her up” has finally seen fruition.
US Navy SEALS loyal to Donald Trump raided Hillary Clinton’s Chappaqua, NY estate and arrested her on charges of treason, destruction of government property, and aiding and abetting the enemy, Real Raw News has learned.
The arrest happened on Tuesday night, according to a source in Trump’s orbit, only hours after Trump had spoken to Rear Admiral Hugh W. Howard at US Special Operations Command and given him a “mammoth trove” of evidence of Clinton’s criminality dating back to her days at the State Department. The evidence allegedly includes thousands of never-before-seen emails, which Clinton acid washed prior to the 2016 presidential election, as well as documents implicating her in plots to assassinate Republican legislators across the country.
The evidence was so compelling, our source added, that Adm. Howard had trouble believing that Clinton wasn’t arrested years ago.
“Trump’s been wanting to get her, and the rest of the Deep State cabal, ever since he set foot in the White House. It has taken him years to dig up the motherload. Once he had military support, he greenlit the operation. Trump’s team, for lack of a better word, had been surveilling Clinton a long time, and he knew she was always alone on Tuesday nights. That’s when the SEALS nabbed her,” our source said.
Under cover of darkness, an eight-man detachment from Naval Special Warfare Group 3 infiltrated the Chappaqua mansion shortly after 2:00am. Mysteriously, Clinton’s two-man Secret Service detail, which normally lives in a guest house on the property, was absent that morning. The SEALS cleared the main building, then silently breached the door to her bedroom, where they found her awake rehearsing a speech before a vanity mirror. They fired a single tranquilizer dart into her neck, our source said, before taping her mouth and sealing a black cloth bag over her head.
The SEALS also seized several laptops and reams of paper, our source said.
“I don’t know where they took her; only Trump knows that. But this is proof that Trump and the military have started taking out the cabal. It took him longer than expected, longer than he wanted, but better late than never. Trump is doing what’s right for America,” our source said.
Trump will soon send her to Guantanamo Bay to face a military tribunal for her crimes against America and its people. GITMO, our source said in closing, is run by the Marine Corps. and the US Navy, both of which have forsaken Joe Biden and instead pledged to help Donald Trump vanquish the forces of darkness that have enshrouded the nation in corruption for decades.

From March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, the CDC found that in 2,313 American counties where mask mandates were issued, daily growth rates of the Chinese coronavirus decreased by only 0.5 percent in the first 20 days of being issued; they went down 1.8 percent within 81-100 days.
Daily death growth rates from the virus decreased by 0.7 percent within the first 20 days of the mandates and 1.9 percent in 81-100 days.
“Daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period,” the CDC study states.
States—focusing on changes in coronavirus case and death rates—began reopening while the CDC study was being conducted.
“Changes in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates were not statistically significant 1–20 and 21–40 days after restrictions were lifted,” the report stated.
The CDC found that within the 3,067 U.S. counties where in-person dining was restored, there was a 1.1 percent increase in daily growth rates of coronavirus cases within 81-100 days and a 3 percent growth in the daily death rate.
“It is notable that no Randomized Controlled Trial from Oxford University has shown 90 percent effectiveness of masks against COVID,” West Texas Dr. Richard Bartlett told Texas Scorecard after reviewing the CDC’s study. “However, Oxford University did have a Randomized Controlled Trial showing 90 percent of COVID hospitalizations and ER visits might be avoided with early treatment with an inexpensive, safe, readily available medication.”
I’m NOT saying it’s a cure, but I would say it’s VERY good news!
On March 2, Gov. Greg Abbott announced last week he was ending his statewide mask mandate. His order took effect this Wednesday, March 10.
This week, the City of Austin defied Abbott’s latest executive order, insisting to continue enforcing mask-wearing. Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing the city.
Meanwhile, State Rep. Matt Schaefer (R–Tyler) has filed House Bill 2097, which would ban mask mandates without legislative approval, and HB 2098, which would  take away officials’ ability to fine citizens for not following their emergency orders.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_409120,"On his last day in the White House, January 19, Donald J. Trump co-authored a flurry of sealed indictments, one of which charges Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett with high crimes and misdemeanors against America and its people, said a former USDOJ employee who helped Trump and then-acting AG Jeffrey Rosen research casework.
Our source said Trump spent days pondering whether to formally charge the 49-year-old mother of seven, but concluded that Barret’s betrayal to both him and the U.S Constitution could not go unpunished.
“Trump is a merciful man willing to accept almost anyone’s apology, but he couldn’t give her a free pass. Not after her ultimate betrayal,” our source said.
On September 26, Trump triumphantly announced his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett in a ceremony at the White House Rose Garden before an audience of top Washington officials, other dignitaries, and family members. Barrett was seen as the conservative poster girl who would bring parity to the Supreme Court and stop the liberal left from hijacking the 2020 presidential election. For weeks, Trump championed her, showing her off at every possible opportunity.
The Senate confirmed her to the Supreme Court on October 26, and two days later she stabbed Trump in the back. On October 28, the Supreme Court ruled on Republican Party of Pennsylvania v. Kathy Boockvar, Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, ruling in her favor. Boockvar wanted to extend the deadline for absentee ballots; the Republicans sought an injunction.
Barrett recused herself from the vote. It was her first opportunity to support the man who fought tooth-and-nail to get her appointed.
“Trump didn’t say anything publicly, but privately he was extremely disappointed. He spent days questioning his own judgement. Even though her vote wouldn’t have swayed the decision, she was expected to cast her vote for justice,” our source said.
On December 8, only days after Biden had stolen the election, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Trump ally, filed lawsuits against Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states that ran illegal and unconstitutional elections. Paxton petitioned the Supreme Court to invalidate illegal ballots, but the Court briskly rejected his motion. In a brief memo, the Supreme Court said “Texas invites this court to arbitrate states’ election process. That Faustian invitation must be firmly rejected.”
Amy Coney Barrett’s signature appeared on the memo.
“This was a sucker punch to Trump’s gut. His team presented incontrovertible evidence of election fraud. He then realized that Amy was a Deep State plant, and a clever one, a very clever one. Trump’s a guarded man, and she blew down his defenses, tricked him good. That’s when started thinking about putting out a sealed indictment on her,” our source said.
Trump and Rosen signed the indictment at 9:30 p.m. on January 19. The charges against Barrett include treason, conspiring with the enemy, and conduct unbecoming a Supreme Court justice. Trump is expected to unseal her indictment—along with many others—once he returns to power before the end of the year.
“Trump realizes the Supreme Court is corrupt to the core,” our source said. “That’s why he’s turned to the military, which is helping him to undo this fraudulent mess. When that happens there will be a reckoning as the traitors are lined up and sent to GITMO for their military tribunals.”"
Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_382188,"In an article titled, “Trafficked Children, Bodies, Weapons Found on Evergreen Ship Blocking Suez Canal”, by Judy Byington, 4-2-2021- it states that over a thousand trafficked children and dead bodies have been rescued out of shipping containers in the Suez Canal by US Navy Seals.
“Sources say that as of this writing, children were still being rescued and bodies discovered in Evergreen’s 18,000+ containers. The containers were on an Evergreen Corporation ship that blocked the Canal from Tues. 23 March to Mon 29 March, causing billions in lost revenue to shipping companies internationally.

“The Seals also found Weapons of Mass Destruction on the six story high vessel – which were believed destined to start a war in the Middle East.
“Finally by Tues. the Evergreen cargo ship was loosened and taken to Bitter Lake in Egypt. By order of the Egyptian President, the containers were taken off the ship and searched by US Navy Seals.

Hillary Rodham Clinton was hanged at Guantanamo Bay Monday night, her death the culmination of an operation that began on March 2 when U.S. Navy SEALs on Donald J. Trump’s authority arrested the disgraced politician at her Chappaqua, NY mansion. After a five-day tribunal at the world’s most infamous detention center, a three-officer panel found Clinton guilty of murder, accessory to murder, treason, child trafficking, and other high crimes. Clinton, who had refused counsel, had uttered nary a word throughout the proceedings, and had taken Vice Adm. John G. Hannink’s sentence of death with an unflinching gaze.
The hanging took place at 9:05 p.m., at once after Taps, which marks the start of quiet hours on U.S. military bases across the globe.
“The world is about to sleep quieter tonight,” Vice Adm. John G. Hannink said to a small assembly that included 3 Joint Chiefs of Staff and, notably, Donald J. Trump, who, garbed in his typical dark suit and crimson tie, had arrived at GITMO earlier in the day. Michael Pompeo and former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani flanked him, both men having played an integral role in amassing evidence against Clinton.
Under military guard, a shackled Hillary Clinton was escorted from Camp Delta detention block to gallows made of steel latticework, with a downward swinging door beneath her feet, that the Army Corps of Engineers had erected in a clearing near Windward Point Lighthouse, on GITMO’s southern edge. Affixed to a steel beam was a rectangular box with five circular, red buttons protruding from the case. In front of each button stood a uniformed soldier. Atop the platform, another soldier slipped a braided noose around Clinton’s neck.
Vice Adm. Hannink addressed the execution detail: “When I say ready, and not one moment before, you will poise your left index finger in front of the button. You will keep it hovered there until I say execute, and then you five must simultaneously press your button. Only one of the five buttons will trigger the door, and none of you will ever know which button that was. Do you understand these instructions?”
“Yes, sir,” the five bellowed in unison.
A chaplain and a physician climbed the 13 steps leading to the top of the platform and stood beside a soldier who was checking to ensure the noose was secure around Clinton’s neck. Below them, Vice Adm. Hannink asked if Clinton wanted last rites or had any final words.
Clinton broke silence. “I’m Hillary Clinton, you can’t do this to me,” she said, her voice a witch’s cackle.
“It’s already done,” Donald J. Trump shouted up at her.
“Ready.” Vice Adm. Hannink nodded at the execution detail.
After a moment’s pause, he gave the “execute” order, the soldiers pressed their buttons, and the grate beneath Clinton’s feet swung open. Her legs and feet, still shackled at the ankles, twitched a moment or two, then stopped.
The rope was cut, and Clinton’s lifeless body lie sprawled in a damp patch of grass. The physician present checked her vitals and declared her dead.
A confidential source involved in Trump’s mission to obliterate the Deep State said the overall mood was somber and melancholy; there was no celebration, no jubilation, just an atmosphere of contentedness, an acknowledgement that what had to be done, was done. The nature of her crimes overshadowed celebratory thought. But a four-decade reign of terror had come to an end.
“As much as Trump hated her, this was purely business. He cares about the children who suffered at her hands more than he cares about what she did to him. Yes, her demise sends a signal to the Deep State. But Trump knows there are many more to go, and he won’t celebrate till the job is done,” our source said."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_910061,"As the Deep State lodged its final and fruitless bid to eliminate Donald Trump by convening a bogus Grand Jury to hear fabricated evidence of non-existent tax fraud, the United States military arrested yet another Deep State asset who had eluded justice for far too long. On Monday morning, U.S. Special Forces arrested Chair of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff at his Potomac, Maryland home.
Sources involved in Trump’s Deep State War and within the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps told RRN that Schiff’s arrest was legal and proper and based on a sealed indictment Donald J. Trump and acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen had authored prior to January 20.
The formal charges against Schiff include numerous high crimes and misdemeanors. Specifically, the indictment alleges that Schiff and other prominent Democrats did knowingly conspire to manufacture unsubstantiated claims that Trump and members of his campaign had colluded with Vladimir Putin to thwart Hillary Clinton’s 2016 bid for the presidency. Moreover, the indictment states that Schiff’s personal war on Trump cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $2,000,000,000, money he misappropriated to fund a personal vendetta. It further stipulates that Schiff unconstitutionally pressed for Trump’s removal from office after grossly exaggerating the context of a telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The indictment concludes Schiff betrayed his oath of office, lied to his constituents, embezzled cash, subverted the Constitution, and committed treason—all in the name of wanting to eradicate his nemesis, Donald Trump.
Even the less severe charge, embezzlement, could deliver upon Schiff a 5 to 99-year sentence in a federal penitentiary, while the most egregious, treason, could see him hanged by the neck until dead.
Sources told RRN the military began its investigation into Schiff’s criminal misconduct in early January and would have arrested him sooner, but both JAG and its cooperating partner, the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division, have been swamped in a litany of indictments. JAG completed its inquiry in mid-May and drew up plans for Schiff’s capture.
“Even then it wasn’t exactly easy. Special Forces would’ve nabbed him more expeditiously, but Schiff was travelling around incognito. He was shuffling between the many homes he owns across the country. But you know what they say: You can run, but you can’t hide,” one source said.
Special Forces, he added, had staked out Schiff’s homes in California, Massachusetts, and Maryland, and had a surveillance team watching the U.S. Capitol. Although Schiff was spotted several times in the Halls of Congress, the military ultimately deduced that the D.C. Schiff was not Schiff at all, but rather a convincing body double.
“The military used gait recognition technology, which proved the body double theory. The Deep State has been using body doubles to protect its ranks,” our source said.
Gait recognition refers to the use of video of human gait, processed by computer vision methods, to recognize or to identify persons based on their body shape and walking styles. This is a passive mode of acquiring biometric data from a distance.
On Monday morning, however, the military hit paydirt, finding the true Adam Schiff alone in his Maryland domicile. When confronted by Special Forces, Schiff pissed himself, fell to his knees, and cried like a baby, our source said.
In closing, our source said Schiff has been taken to a “holding facility” where he will await transportation to Guantanamo Bay."

AMERICANS DESERVE THE FULL TRUTH!

Conservative documentarian and influencer Jesus Rivera was charged for doing journalism at the Capitol on January 6 — while Black Lives Matter activists and leftist New Yorker reporters who were doing the same thing were not charged.
This will not surprise anyone who is paying attention.
There are two judicial systems today in America today.  One, for those on the left who can spy on the US President and worse and get away with it.  And one justice system for those who support President Trump and are put in isolation for walking through the US Capitol on January 6th.

In March TGP reporter Cassandra Fairbanks wrote about Jesus Rivera, a father of four, husband and U.S. Marine Corps veteran works as a camera man and cinematographer — but has been unable to do his job since the feds confiscated all of his equipment.
** Rivera has now made a fundraising account on GiveSendGo. People who wish to contribute can do so here.
Rivera got footage people going in through open door on the side, completely unobstructed, police officers inside directing traffic as people casually filtered through the building, and other scenes from inside. He maintains he was not protesting — simply doing journalism — the same as Luke Mogelson from The New Yorker and others.
On Monday Jesus Rivera sent The Gateway Pundit video from inside the US Capitol on January 6.

Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Democrats like to say the January 6th protests were just like 9-11 where 3,000 Americans were killed in cold blood by Islamist extremists.
But that is not what the evidence shows.
Jesus sent The Gateway Pundit a new video of the protest inside the US Capitol on January 6.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_595834,"California’s November 3, 2020 election was marred by significant voting and registration irregularities, says the Election Integrity Project® California, Inc. (EIPCa).

The non-partisan organization analyzed the state’s official voter list of February 9, 2021 and reported its findings to California’s Secretary of State Shirley Weber June 17, 2021. “This followed EIPCa reports of 2020 cross-state voting on April 30 and May 18, 2021 that the Secretary has ignored.  EIPCa’s June report cites California’s election code that requires officials to provide timely answers to citizens’ questions.”

“Many in the nation are questioning the validity of the 2020 general election in their states,” EIPCa President Linda Paine said Tuesday.

“Mass irregularities in California’s registration and voting numbers continue to erode voter confidence here and we are hopeful Secretary Weber will immediately address our questions.”

EIPCa seeks answers to the following questions, on behalf of California voters:

Why are there almost 124,000 more votes counted in California’s November 3, 2020 election than voters recorded as voting in that election? And why is most of the discrepancy driven by 116,000 vote-by-mail ballots with no apparent voter identified in VoteCal’s voting histories? Click here for a list by county.
Why do more than 7,700 voters have TWO November 3, 2020 votes credited to their voting histories? These are two votes credited to each of 7,700 unique (non-duplicated) registration ID numbers in the state database. This indicates mass double voting, a significant programming error in the state’s registration system, or both.
Why does California have 1.8 million more registered voters than eligible citizens and why did this overage rise 72% in the 2020 election cycle? Click here for a list by county.
Some counties have an astoundingly high number of ineligible registrants (see County list below):

Sacramento County: 36,737, Orange County: 92,014, San Diego County: 247,671, Los Angeles County: 1,138,910, even tiny Alpine County with 924 eligible citizens has 85 ineligible registrants.

Why did California’s on-line and DMV registration systems change 33,000 foreign-born voters’ birthplaces of record to “California” or “United States”, potentially masking non-citizens unlawfully registered to vote? Similarly, why were 76,000 birthplaces changed from another U.S. state to California? Click here for a chart of birthplace changes.

The EIPCa asks “why has the number of ineligible registrants grown over time? Why by 72% in the past year? 3b) What action(s) will the Secretary’s office take to correct these ineligible registrations?”

Between June 2017 and November 2020, EIPCa identified 93,911 registrants who show inexplicable changes of birthplaces from a foreign country or another U.S. state to “California.”
Of these, 68% appear to have occurred using the on-line registration system and 21% using the DMV registration system.
An additional 14,796 had birthplaces were changed from a foreign country to “United States of America.” Of these, 62% were associated with the on-line registration system and 27% with the DMV registration system.
California’s most recent election anomalies

As stunning as this is, it’s been going on in California for many years, and is only getting worse, despite efforts to expose voting irregularities, and clean up voter rolls.

Party registrations were changed right before the June 2016 Primary election, ensuring a Hillary Clinton win over challenger Bernie Sanders, in what was called electronic vote rigging, I reported in 2017. California was a crucial state for both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, but the election was called for Clinton minutes after the polls closed, but before millions of provisional ballot votes were counted.

A 2017 study by Stanford University proved that Hillary Clinton‘s campaign pre-rigged the system to steal the nomination from Bernie Sanders. And it was never more apparent than in California where Bernie Sanders voters were likely robbed of a legitimate candidate.

Thousands of voters in the June 7, 2016 California Primary election showed up at the polls across the state to discover their political party registrations had been changed, or dropped altogether… but only after they had received official sample ballots verifying their party registration in the mail. This only could have been done within the Secretary of State’s VoteCal system.

Thousands of Republican and Democratic voters reported to the Election Integrity Project that they arrived at their designated polling stations on June 7th to find that their party affiliation had been changed. Most reported being re-registered “No Party Preference,” California’s version of “Decline to State.” Others said their registrations were dropped, or they received the wrong ballot, which in many cases prevented them from voting for President in the primary.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_440153,"Marine Corps General David H. Berger on Monday rebuked Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s edict requiring all Armed Forces personnel to submit to Covid-19 vaccinations under threat of court martial or discharge, said a source in Gen. Berger’s office who overheard a heated conversation between them.
Gen. Berger telephoned the defense secretary minutes after he said in a press conference that the Covid-19 vaccination is needed to maintain military readiness and that he would enforce the mandatary vaccination policy regardless of FDA approval status.
“There will be no mandatory vaccinations for my Marines,” Gen. Berger said.
In a transcript of the call reviewed by Real Raw News, Gen. Berger lambasted Austin and branded him a traitor.
“Under no circumstances will Marines be compelled to take a potentially hazardous vaccination that the FDA won’t even fully endorse,” Gen. Berger told Austin. “You are a coward and a traitor, manipulated by people pushing bad policy on the men and women who provide security to our nation. Neither you nor your puppet president has authority to enforce such a policy.”
Austin argued that mandatory vaccinations have always been a requirement for soldiers enlisting into the Armed Forces, and they, as property of the U.S. government, have no right to decide whether to take the Covid-19 jab. The federal government and President Biden would decide for them, Austin said.
“They’re incapable of making informed decisions. So we, their leaders, make the big decisions they cannot,” Austin said. “Biden and Harris are in charge, not individual soldiers.”
Then Austin got political: “If conservatives and evangelicals see our fighting forces getting vaccinated, they’ll be more likely to get vaccinated themselves,” Austin said.
Gen. Berger said it was unfair to compare established vaccinations with a product that was rushed to market with little concern for side effects. He called the CDC and Dr. Fauci corrupt, and he asked Austin why the puppet administration hid from the public an NIH report linking the vaccination to thousands of fatalities.
“If someone dies, you say it was Covid-19. There’s a refusal to admit the vaccination carries side effects that can include death in certain individuals.”
“I’m not a physician. I’m the Secretary of Defense for Joseph R. Biden, and I follow orders,” Austin retorted.
“In case you haven’t heard, Biden’s not in charge of the military, and neither are you. You can sell whatever lies you want to the media. You sold your soul, Lloyd, and I hope you can live with yourself,” Gen. Berger said.
Gen. Berger said he had the support of other Joint Chiefs of Staff and would implore them to ignore unlawful orders coming from the illegitimate administration.
“If a soldier wants the vaccination, fine. If not, he’s not rolling up his sleeve. If you try to forcibly vaccinate even one of my Marines, you better come armed,” Gen. Berger said, and hung up the phone.
In a statement Monday afternoon, Biden said he strongly supports Austin’s message and that he is “eager to see” the Covid-19 vaccination added to the battery of vaccinations soldiers receive upon joining the military."

The vast majority of (oblivious) Americans have dismissed all this as a “conspiracy theory,” and now they’re shocked and frightened by the realization that covid internment camps are being actively deployed across America.
On Friday, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed Executive Order 83, which authorizes National Guard and State Guard troops to break into peoples’ homes, kidnap them at gunpoint, and take them to covid internment camps, all without any due process or respect for civil rights. Individuals can be targeted for this medical kidnapping by armed troops via “telephone assessments,” and the medical kidnapping of American citizens is being labeled “involuntary commitment” to “temporary quarantine and isolation facilities.”
In other words, FEMA-style concentration camps are here, and covid is the excuse for mass arrests and executions of Americans.
These are, of course, death camps being constructed and operated under the cover of the covid plandemic, which we have exhaustively shown is rooted in junk science fraud and media psychological operations.
The Tennessee EO is on top of the CDC’s announcement that covid camps will be set up on a nationwide basis, with people being medically kidnapped and taken to “humanitarian settings” where they will be forced into labor pools, just like a scene ripped right out of Nazi Germany.
The average American, upon learning that concentration camps are now being authorized in the United States, is expressing shock and disbelief that this so-called “conspiracy theory” turns out to be official government policy. As reported by WorldNetDaily.com, social media users are responding with comments like:
Wow! The guard will be utilized? Involuntary commitment? And construction of quarantine and isolation facilities? Thought all of that was just a silly conspiracy theory.

“It’s time for us to resist. They can’t arrest all of us,” Paul said in the video. “They can’t keep all of your kids home from school. They can’t keep every government building closed, although I’ve got a long list of ones they might keep closed or ought to keep closed.”
Here is the video.
Dr. Andrew Canard heads the AMA. He believes the organization must take a stand against members who wish to harm their patients and the general public. “Senator Paul is no longer a practicing doctor, and he shouldn’t be a senator either,” he said.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_71761,"WASHINGTON-(MaraviPost)-In a shocking announcement, Bill Gates, billionaire Microsoft co-founder and the major force behind the COVID-19 vaccines, called for all the COVID-19 genetic-based vaccines to be taken off the market immediately.
In an often anguished 19-minute televised speech, Gates said: “We made a terrible mistake. We wanted to protect people against a dangerous virus. But it turns out the virus is much less dangerous than we thought. And the vaccine is far more dangerous than anyone imagined.”
By W. Gelles
“These vaccines—Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca—they’re killing people left and right—and they’re injuring some people very badly,” Gates continued, waving his hands in the air at times for dramatic effect.
“The government’s own data shows us this is what’s happening. The CDC’s reporting system is showing, what?…around 13,000 deaths so far in the U.S. and over half a million adverse events. Well, we all know the reporting system is a sham.
“We know that VAERS [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System] captures only around one percent of what’s going on. So we’re talking over a million deaths from these Covid vaccines, and more than 60 million people with bad side effects.”
“This is not what we wanted. This is not acceptable,” Mr. Gates asserted.
Wall Street shares of all the major Covid vaccine companies plummeted by 20% to 30% as Mr. Gates announced that he was joining the urgent Citizen Petition filed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Children’s Health Defense organization calling on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to immediately withdraw all the COVID vaccines from the market.
Gates continued: “Too many people who take these vaccines drop dead…one day, two days, five days after getting the shot. Other people suffer paralysis, blindness, convulsions, heart attacks, immune system collapse, blood clots, brain inflammation, lung or kidney damage, miscarriages, autoimmune disease, multiple organ system failure, permanent profound fatigue, and many other horrible problems.
“Of course, our Media Mouthpieces—I mean the mainstream news media, dismiss all these tragedies as ‘just a coincidence.’”
“The reason they say that,” Gates explained, “is because of what I did at Event 201, a Coronavirus Pandemic Simulation held in New York in October 2019 just a few weeks before we announced the actual pandemic. I got all the major newspapers, TV channels, and radio stations to agree to stick with the Official Narrative—‘the vaccines are safe and effective’—and to censor anybody who questions this line of BS.
“So the public never got to hear the evidence from hundreds of distinguished doctors and medical researchers who warned that the vaccines are dangerous and often lethal.” 
“That was a huge mistake on my part,” Gates maintained, looking weary and at times teary-eyed. “We never should have done that. People have every right to be well-informed, to get all the facts so they can make a rational decision.”
Changing the topic as if to elicit sympathy, Mr. Gates confided: “I’ve been going through a rough time and doing a lot of soul-searching since Melinda dumped me. This divorce has caused me to take a good hard look at myself. I don’t want to be remembered as a monster who killed millions of people through deadly vaccines. I am not a monster. I am not a mass murderer. I don’t want to be remembered as a mass murderer by my family, my friends, and my company.
“Some people have called me a sociopath or even a psychopath because of my visionary schemes to help humanity—like reducing global warming by spraying dust into the upper atmosphere, or releasing millions of genetically-modified mosquitoes to combat dengue and Zika virus.”

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_996737,"On Saturday, September 11, 43-year-old Dale Oliver of Sandy Hook, Kentucky, was engaged in his typical weekend ritual—watching college football on TV—when he heard a knock on his front door. Upon opening it, he found himself face-to-face with two uninvited guests, representatives of Elliott County Health Department. They wished to speak to him about his vaccination status.
“It’s come to our attention your family has not been vaccinated. May we come in?” one health official said, according to Mr. Oliver.
Mr. Oliver lives in a modest home with his wife of 15 years and their 13-year-old daughter, whom they have started homeschooling in response to draconian mask mandates. A hardworking diesel mechanic who puts in 60 hours a week, Mr. Oliver prefers to spend his limited free time at home with his family, free of unwanted intrusions. He told Real Raw News that he self-identifies as a “Trump supporting constitutionalist, conservative” who has serious concerns over the safety and efficacy of the current Covid-19 vaccinations and the current administration’s unconstitutional vaccine mandates.
Elliott County, where he lives, is barely a blip on the map, a heavily Democratic County of 7,500 souls.
“I told them whether or not we’ve taken the shot was none of their damn business and to leave. But they just stood there staring at me like I was some kind of animal or something. I was curious and asked how they hell they’d know if I and my family got jabbed,” Mr. Elliott told RRN.
The county health officers were not schooled in Deep State discretion, apparently.
They told Mr. Oliver that 2020 Census data showed 3 people living in the household, and that information, when compared against the CDCs vaccination database, proved that neither Mr. Oliver nor his wife and daughter had been vaccinated for Covid-19.
Their statements raise grave concern, as the CDC insists it does not maintain a database of vaccination and unvaccinated persons, and claims vaccination records it receives are collected in aggregate, with no personal identifying information. Mr. Oliver’s encounter certainly casts doubt on CDC honesty, and it’s simple to see just how easily the CDC can obtain an individual’s vaccination status.
Typically, people get vaccinated at one of two venues—either a pharmacy or a mass depopulation—vaccination—center. Before getting jabbed, people present proof of identity—insurance cards and/or a photo ID, both of which reveal a home address; most city and county mass vaccination sites across the country require proof of residency to get the jab. Therefore, county health officials can figure out who has and who has not received a vaccination.
The CDC and county health officials have obtained 2020 Census records to enhance their vaccination enforcement protocols. Respondents of the 2020 Census were asked how many people dwell in a household, a question that has appeared on the intrusive, decennial survey since its start in 1902.
“I regret filling that thing out at all,” Mr. Oliver said. “I had no idea it would be used against me. This is criminal.”
Elliott County health officers, Mr. Oliver added, accused him of being an “anti-vaxxer” an endangering the lives of not only his family but also neighbors who had taken Covid-19 vaccinations.
“They told me I’m a health risk to the community, and that if I got anyone sick, I could be charged with crimes. When I told them bastards that I didn’t have time to wait in some damn 12-hour line for a shot, they told me they’d send someone to my house to give us the shot. Fuckers outright said Joe Biden and Dr. Fauci want me to take it, to protect other people from Covid-19. I started to close the door and their ugly faces when they really pissed me off,” Mr. Oliver said.
The Elliott County health officers questioned Mr. Oliver as to why he had unenrolled his daughter from the Elliott County School District and opted instead to homeschool her.
“You’re the only person in the district to pull your daughter out of school. Is there a problem? We can arrange counselling for your family if you think the vaccine is unsafe, and we can send CPS for a wellness check on your daughter—can we speak to her?”
Mr. Oliver said he slammed shut the door.
RRN has viewed door-cam footage corroborating Mr. Oliver’s assertions; however, he has asked that it remain confidential for now, as he has hired a lawyer and intends to sue Elliott County for violating his family’s privacy.
“Somehow, all my neighbors know we’re not vaccinated now, and they’re giving us dirty looks all the time,” Mr. Oliver said."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_251530,"As reported by Real Raw News earlier this week, Guantanamo Bay security personnel discovered Bill Clinton’s corpse lying on the floor of his cell at Camp Delta’s segregation block at approximately 7:00 a.m., Saturday, September 25. He was face-down in a puddle of vomit and did not respond to attempts to resuscitate him. Clinton was alive and in good health the previous evening; he ate a 6:00 p.m. meal and was seen reading a book on his bunk just prior to lights out at 9:00 p.m. Friday night, according to the testimony of two GITMO guards.
On Monday, September 27, a forensic toxicologist, Lt. Cassidy Lemmon of the Naval Criminal Investigative Services (NCIS) and Captain Dale Ramirez, Commanding Officer, U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay, oversaw Clinton’s autopsy.
They found no physical wounds on his body or signs of struggle or ligature marks around his neck and ruled out the possibility that he had hanged himself or perished in an altercation with another inmate, the latter of which would have been impossible because Clinton had been housed in isolation.
Samples of Clinton’s blood were sent to the lab for a toxicology screen, and on Thursday afternoon Captain Ramirez sent the results to the Office of Military Commissions and U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps.
Clinton had ingested copious amounts of a poison called Ricin, a GITMO source told Real Raw News.
Ricin is a highly potent toxin produced by the seeds of the castor oil plant, and an estimated lethal dose is 1 milligram per kilogram of human body weight. It is deadly if inhaled, ingested, injected, and can be toxic even if dust enters the eyes. Symptoms of Ricin poisoning include gastrointestinal distress, pain, hemorrhage in the mucosal membranes, severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing.
“We believe Clinton received a large dose of Ricin at one time,” our source said. “Typically, symptoms develop over several days, followed by death. Clinton had not reported any symptoms in the days leading up to his death. He was exposed to an exceptionally heavy dose, several hundred milligrams.”
Toxicologic tests on remnants of Clinton’s final meal, chicken patties and mashed potatoes with congealed gravy, corroborated autopsy conclusions; the food had a high concentration of Ricin.
JAG and the NCIS are treating Clinton’s death as a homicide, as Clinton had no way of importing the poison into GITMO.
“Bill Clinton had no visitors at all during his confinement,” our source said. “Efforts are being taken to determine how the food was laced with poison, and by whom.”

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_318548,"Alex Jones of Infowars made a special broadcast on Monday night regarding an explosive video of Fauci with HHS officials and other health experts discussing how to enforce Universal Flu Vaccination in a summit organized by Milken Institute in Washington, DC last October 2019.
Alex Jones highlighted three clips from the hour-long video of the summit from C-SPAN which proved the COVID-19 pandemic was planned and the Big Pharma worked with the UN and other corrupt government officials to develop and release the COVID-19 virus ahead of ‘Great Reset’.
The first clip featured  Michael Specter, a journalist from The New Yorker and also an adjunct professor of bioengineering at Stanford University, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Rick Bright, the director of HHS Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).
In this video, they conceptualized having a new outbreak of novel avian flu virus from China so they can bypass the method of FDA approval and enforce mRNA vaccine to the masses.

Here’s the transcript:
Michael Specter: Why don’t we blow the system up? I mean obviously, we can’t just turn off the spigot on the system. We have and then say, hey everyone in the world should get this new vaccine that we haven’t given to anyone yet. But there must be some way that we grow vaccines mostly in eggs the way we did in 1947.
Fauci: In order to make the transition from getting out of the tried-and-true egg growing which we know gives us results that can be beneficial, I mean we’ve done well with that. There must be something that has to be much better. You have to prove that this works and then you’ve got to go through all of the clinical trials: phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, and then show that this particular product is going to be good over a period of years. That alone, if it works perfectly, it’s going to take a decade.
Bright: There might be a need or even an urgent call for an entity of excitement out there that’s completely disruptive, that’s not beholden to bureaucratic strings and processes.
Fauci: So we really do have a problem of how the world perceives influenza and it’s going to be very difficult to change that unless you do it from within and say, I don’t care what your perception is, we’re going to address the problem in a disruptive and in an iterative way because she does need both.
Bright: But it is not too crazy to think that an outbreak of novel avian virus could occur in China somewhere. We could get the RNA sequence from that.. to a number of regional centers if not local, if not even in your home at some point, and print those vaccines on a patch of self-administer.
Watch the clip (full video below):
More from Medical Kidnap:
Joining Fauci, Rick Bright, and Michael Specter at this event were: Margaret Hamburg, Foreign Secretary, National Academy of Medicine, Bruce Gellin, President, Global Immunization, Sabin Vaccine Institute, Casey Wright, CEO, FluLab.
In short, this panel discussion focused on what they perceived as the need for a universal flu vaccine, but they admitted that the old way of producing vaccines was not sufficient for their purposes, and that they needed some kind of global event where many people were dying to be able to roll out a new mRNA vaccine to be tested on the public.
They all agreed that the annual flu virus was not scary enough to create an event that would convince people to get a universal vaccine. And as we now know today, about 2 years after this event, that “terrifying virus” that was introduced was the COVID-19 Sars virus.

And so now we know why the flu just “disappeared” in the 2020-21 flu season. It was simply replaced by COVID-19, in a worldwide cleverly planned “pandemic” to roll out the world’s first universal mRNA vaccines.
This was always the goal, and previous efforts through various influenzas, AIDS, Ebola, and other “viruses” were all unsuccessful in leading to the development of a universal vaccine to inject into the entire world’s population.
Margaret Hamburg stated regarding getting a “Universal Vaccine” into the market: “It’s time to stop talking, and it’s time to act… I think it is also because we haven’t had a sense of urgency.”
Michael Specter asked: “Do we need lots of people to die for that sense of urgency to occur?”
Hamburg replied that: “There are already lots of people dying” from the flu each year.
Bruce Gellin stated that basically people just are not afraid enough of the term “the flu.”
There are so many things that are revealed about how Big Pharma and government health authorities think in this panel discussion. For example, they bemoan the fact that if they do too good of a job in public health, then they lose funding to develop products that fight viruses.
Michael Specter states: “It seems to me that one of the curses of the public health world is, if you guys do your job well, everyone goes along well and healthy.”
Hamburg: “And they cut your funding.”
Rick Bright complains that the yearly distribution of flu vaccines is inefficient in terms of collecting data, and in the process actually admits that some vaccines just don’t work well:
“We distribute 150 million doses of the seasonal (flu) vaccines every year, we don’t even know how many people are being vaccinated from the doses that are delivered to the people, which doses they got, and what the real outcome was, so that we can learn from that knowledge base on how to optimize or improve our vaccine. So there are opportunities that we have today…
I think if we uncloaked the poorest performing vaccines in the market place today, it might be very revealing to tell us which of the technologies we have, and allow us to go deeper into those technologies to determine why they are more effective. There are vaccines licenses today that are more effective. I think that we’re just afraid to admit the truth.”

** President Trump won more Hispanic votes.
** President Trump won more female votes.

But somehow Democrat Joe Biden, who did not campaign and can barely string two sentences together, supposedly won 81 million votes.

The same guy who can’t get 20 people to come out and see him when he travels around the US.
So how did Joe do it? How did Democrats steal the 2020 election?
We now know Democrats used several means to score illegal votes in several states. We witnessed them counting ballots behind closed doors, bringing in endless piles of ballots days after the election, locking Republicans out of the counting rooms, pulling boxes of ballots out from under tables when all the observers were sent home, driving in vanloads of ballots in the early hours of the morning after Joe Biden fell far behind.
And now we have another clue on how they stole the election and who they stole their votes from.
Huffington Post today credited “low-income voters” with giving Joe Biden the win.
This is preposterous on its face since everyone knows Trump connected to working-class voters like no other president in the last 100 years.
But it does give us a clue on where they found these mysterious votes.
Via The Huffington Post.
High turnout among low-income voters in the 2020 election — especially in battleground states — helped deliver victories for Joe Biden and Democrats in the Senate and House, concluded the study, “Waking the Sleeping Giant,” by the Poor People’s Campaign. The organization, an advocate for low-income Americans, launched a nonpartisan voter registration drive ahead of the 2020 vote across 16 states…
…But the 2020 elections saw the highest voter turnout in U.S.history, including among poor and low-income voters, noted the study.
Of the 168 million Americans who voted last year, 59 million of them— 35% of the total — had an estimated annual household income of less than $50,000, classifying them as “poor” or low-income, the analysis found.

Where the margin of Biden’s victory was a squeaker-thin 3% or less, low-income Americans accounted for 34% to 45% of the voting population (Arizona 39.96%), Georgia (37.84%), Michigan (37.81%), Nevada (35.78%), North Carolina (43.67%), Pennsylvania (34.12%) and Wisconsin (39.80%), according to the study.
The low-income voters included large numbers of white Americans as well as people of color.
The figures “challenge … the media-driven narrative that … white low-income voters are the de facto base of the Republican Party and delivered Donald Trump into the White House” in 2016, wrote study author Shailly Gupta Barnes.
Read the rest of this nonsense here.
This SHOULD make the job easier for Trump supporters in discovering the fraud.
Canvassing must be done and if possible the canvassing must target the lower-income citizens who reportedly voted in 2020.

Sweden's Public Health Agency on Wednesday recommended a temporary halt to the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine among young adults, citing concerns over rare side effects to the heart. It said the pause should initially be in force until December 1, explaining that it had received evidence of an increased risk of side effects such as inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) and inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis). {link to CBS News (Secure)]
Finland, Denmark and Norway have also moved away from the COVID vaccines. 
Finland last Thursday joined Sweden, Denmark and Norway in recommending against use of Moderna Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine in younger age groups, citing risks of rare cardiovascular side effects they said warranted the precautionary steps.
Finland’s Institute for Health and Welfare said last Thursday it would pause use of the Moderna vaccine among men under the age of 30, following a similar step last Wednesday by Swedish regulators. Denmark last Wednesday said it wouldn’t offer the Moderna vaccine to under-18s as a precautionary measure.
Norway on Wednesday advised that all under-18s shouldn’t be given the Moderna vaccine, even if they had already received one dose, and recommended that men under 30 consider getting the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech instead. Norwegian officials cited U.S., Canadian and Nordic data, saying the absolute risks remain low and calling the advice “a precautionary measure.”
The European Medicines Agency said Thursday that new preliminary data from the Nordic countries supports a warning the agency adopted in July that inflammatory heart conditions called myocarditis and pericarditis can occur in very rare cases following vaccination with Covid-19 shots made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.
By far, however, the absolute superstar among foreign nations dealing with COVID is Japan.  Japan has PULLED the vaccines and substituted Ivermectin - and in one month, wiped COVID out in that country!

Any questions?
 
Just so you understand the timeline.

By September deaths from the COVID-19 Vaccine jabs were being investigated.

At roughly that time, the vials were under scrutiny and metal ""magnetic"" material was found in them.

Very shortly thereafter, the Japanese minister of health announced doctors could prescribe Ivermectin.

A month later, the Western press is shocked that COVID has all but disappeared from the island.

Get it?

Understand?

This is what it looks like in a country that still has rule of law. The governemnt responds to reports of death and contaminated vaxes, moves to real treatment, people get better, and the virus disappears.

Now compare that to what is happening in the United States and in Australia and New Zealand.  All three countries are in dismal failure in their handling of COVID-19, and that failure has resulted in staggering loss of freedom and destruction of commerce.
 
This is the biggest news story right now.

Japan has ended COVID. It did it after it stopped the vax rollout and went to Ivermectin.

Period. Hard stop.
Hal Turner Editorial Opinion

If your government really wanted to end COVID, if that was its true goal, it would do what Japan did.

You can use Japan as a case study any time someone starts yammering some crap about how the vax is about helping you help yourself from getting others sick with what they've been vaxed against.

You use it as a case study when they try to make some lame argument about how the government is really really really trying its best to end COVID and it is the MAGA crowd that is causing the variants and keeping the virus around.

Japan stopped vaxing.  Japan went to IVM.  Japan is COVID-free. It did it in less than a month!
 
So if your government won't do what Japan did, now that JAPAN HAS BEAT COVID, what does it say about your government?

It says the conspiracy theorists were right! They were right. It is a damning conviction of the narrative that the government is somehow a benevolent force against you getting viruses.

No, because we now have historic precedent of a government doing the right thing and getting the WIN.

If your government won't do it, it is because the vax is about something other than the public good.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_760305,"Navy SEALs on Tuesday launched a predawn raid on one of the hundreds of cargo vessels, a Hong Kong-flagged bulk carrier called the Morning Star, anchored off Long Beach, California, and rescued 200 foreign children who had been imprisoned in a decrepit cargo hold, said a military adjunct under promise of anonymity.
Alas, the SEALs also recovered the bodies of 12 dead children, our source added.
Although operational details are scant, Real Raw News learned that SEALs from Coronado infiltrated the vessel at approximately 2:00 a.m., then stealthily traversed the ship, subduing its 20-man crew and the captain using non-lethal force. No SEALs or crew were killed during the incursion, our source said.
It is uncertain whether the SEALs knew precisely where the children were held on the ship or if they obtained intelligence through interrogations, but they found 200 emaciated children of different nationalities in an expansive cargo hold below decks.
“It was a horrible scene. Some of these kids were shackled to bulkhead, others were lying in puddles of their own feces and urine. No food in the hold, and only a few 55-gallon drums of what looked like putrid water,” our source said.
The SEALs, he added, captured the crew and ferried them ashore (to an unknown location) aboard a U.S. Navy MK5 Special Operations Craft, and took the children into protective custody for medical treatment and identification.
Interestingly, he claimed “someone” at Mar-a-Lago had provided U.S. Special Operations (Command) with credible evidence of “child trafficking” on the vessel. He would not, however, say whether the tip came directly from Donald J. Trump.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was arrested at his home in the affluent suburb of Scarsdale, New York Friday morning by the FBI and charged with multiple counts of fraud. Bourla is being held while he awaits a bail hearing. Federal agents are in the process of executing a search warrant at his home and at multiple other properties he owns across the country.
Albert Bourla faces fraud charges for his role in deceiving customers on the effectiveness of the COVID-19 “vaccine.” Pfizer is accused of falsifying data, and paying out large bribes. According to an FBI agent that spoke to the Conservative Beaver, Pfizer lied about the effectiveness of the vaccines, and mislead customers about the serious side effects the vaccines can produce. Pfizer is accused of paying off governments and the mainstream media to stay silent.
Albert Bourla was already in hot water after it was revealed Pfizer, and a research partner, “falsified data, un-blinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events.” The whistleblower Brook Jackson was fired as a result of her attempts to stop the fraud that was being committed, BMJ reported.
In October, Project Veritas released a series of leaks dubbed “PfizerLeaks.” In the video, another Pfizer whistleblower reveals how the company uses aborted fetal cells in the COVID-19 “vaccine.” Pfizer tried to keep this fact hidden from the public.

If convicted, Albert Bourla could spend the rest of his life in prison. Bourla is considered innocent until proven guilty.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_696093,"U.S. Marines arrested disgraced California Governor Gavin Newsom on 1 November, delivering another major blow to the Deep State hegemony’s plans to impose permanent lockdowns and enslave law-abiding American citizens.

The arrest, Real Raw News can now report, took place at Newsom’s lavish $4m estate in Fair Oaks, California, days after he received a Covid-19 booster shot and fell violently ill. His last public appearance on October 27 was a public relations stunt that showed him getting his 3rd vaccination, and on October 31, his Twitter account, which may be controlled by persons other than Newsom, tweeted a photo of his family adorned in Halloween costumes. Even MSM publications such as the Daily Mail have raised concerns over Newsom’s inexplicable silence.

A military source speaking under promise of anonymity told RRN that Newsom became “seriously ill” 36-hours following the shot but opted to try to recuperate at home rather than admitting himself into a hospital.

“When the Office of Military Commissions learned Newsom was weakened and without much protection, it decided to act,” our source said.



During early morning on 1 November, an unknown number of Marines sent by United States Marine Forces Special Command infiltrated the Newsom estate and engaged two California State police officers who had been assigned to guard the Deep State governor. The Marines, our source said, offered state police a chance to surrender, but the officers drew sidearms and forced the Marines to respond with lethal force. Both officers took multiple hits, killing them, and no Marines were wounded in the brief firefight.

Having dispatched Newsom’s security, the Marines navigated the residence and spotted Newsom’s wife, Jennifer, and their four children dashing down a hallway that ended in a false wall leading to a “Safe Room,” a fortified room that is installed in a private residence or business to provide a safe shelter, or hiding place, for the inhabitants in the event of a break in, home invasion, tornado, terror attack, or other threat.

Mrs. Newsom and the children entered the panic room before the Marines were able to catch and interrogate them, our source said.

“The soldiers cleared the rest of the place and they found Gavin Newsom and his private physician in the master bedroom. The doc threw his hands in the air immediately and said he was just there to care for Newsom and didn’t want any trouble,” our source said.

A bedridden Newsom lie on his back with an intubation tube stuck down his throat and a nasal cannula jammed up his nostrils. Beside the bed stood an array of portable patient monitors.

“When the Marines said they were taking Newsom, the doctor warned them that he’d die if disconnected from the life support equipment. A Corpsman in the team radioed for aid, and a military ambulance soon arrived. They took Newsom and the doctor, presumably to question, from the home. They didn’t try to get his wife or kids, though,” our source said.

Newsome was taken to an unknown medical facility for treatment and, when medically fit, will be processed by JAG and sent to Guantanamo Bay to face a military tribunal.

Asked why the Marines didn’t simply “pull the plug” if the military intends to seek capitol punishment, our source said, “That wasn’t their job. Newsom may have answers we need. If he survives, he will face the same charges Cuomo did.”

Meanwhile, the MSM has blamed Newsome’s lengthy silence on “family obligations,” an obvious lie.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_654949,"U.S. Special Forces arrested former President George W. Bush Saturday morning at his Crawford, Texas, ranch following a blistering firefight with Secret Service agents and private security contractors assigned to protect him.
On Friday evening, a Special Forces “Alpha Detachment” stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, received from U.S. Army Special Operations Command orders to infiltrate the ranch and arrest the 43rd president. SF were told to expect resistance because recent intelligence on the ranch showed that Bush had surrounded himself with armed private security contractors in addition to the trio of Secret Service agents that routinely patrolled the grounds.
Transportation to the ranch was provided by the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, nicknamed Night Stalkers, a group of highly skilled chopper pilots that conduct transport, attack, assault, and reconnaissance missions, at night, at low altitude, and on short notice. The choppers had to make 3 refueling stops to reach their destination.
Under cover of darkness early Saturday morning, the choppers descended into a clearing near the southeast corner of Bush’s 1,600-acre ranch, far from the staff trailers and the main house where they hoped to find Bush sleeping. After offloading SF, the choppers ascended into the night to await a call for exfiltration.
A military source familiar with the mission told Real Raw News that Special Operations Command had obtained detailed satellite imagery of the property as well as locations of trail cams that live-streamed to a communications bunker 100 yards from the main building.

“Intelligence estimated that Bush had 20 security contractors and 3 Secret Service on the property. The plan was to exploit blind spots in the surveillance cameras, ingress to the main building, subdue Bush’s personal guards, and drag him to the exfil point without alerting the larger security force. But something went horribly wrong,” our source said.
Special Forces had approached to within 200 yards of the main house when all hell broke loose.
Two open-top ATVs, each with a driver and 3 security personnel, sped out of the darkness and toward the encroaching SF unit, the headlights momentarily illuminating the soldiers as they separated into groups and dove for cover. Bush’s security unleashed a hailstorm of suppressive fire, wounding one soldier and killing another. While one SF group engaged the enemy, the other dashed toward the main house, hoping to capture Bush before he could be evacuated on his own private helicopter, which sat parked near the main structure.

“The battle turned in our favor quickly. SF took cover behind a rock wall and with the aid of NVGs shot out the tires on both vehicles and then killed or grievously wounded Bush’s security. But they knew there was still at least a dozen patrolling the property and they would’ve been alerted and on their way. Time was of the essence,” our source said.
The second SF unit reached the main house just as 2 Secret Service agents emerged and began steering Bush, still in his pajamas, to an armored limousine parked alongside dense shrubbery. SF instructed them to halt and throw up their hands, but the agents wheeled around and drew weapons, only to be killed a second later.
Somewhere on the property a deafening klaxon blared like an air raid siren.
“They gagged and bagged Bush, then regrouped. They couldn’t make the exfil point, not with one KIA and a teammate with a sucking chest wound. They radioed for pickup where they stood. A pilot told them that enemy forces were mobilizing near the staff trailers, and they had only minutes to get out of there. The birds weren’t armed for combat; otherwise, they could’ve hosed down those trailers,” our source said.
The choppers touched down only long enough to retrieve SF and their package, avoiding further conflict.
Our source said that JAG and the Office of Military Commissions had long sought Bush’s arrest. He did not say why it waited so long or why it felt such an impetus to grab Bush Saturday morning. Bush, he said, has been charged with treason and is being held to account for the deaths of thousands of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan and for his role in masterminding 9/11, in addition to other crimes.
“He will face a military tribunal,” our source said."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_582239,"Ursula Van Der Leyen, the head of the EU commission, told the press on Wednesday that she is in favour of scrapping the long-standing Nuremburg Code and forcing people to get vaccinated against COVID.
""Hey, it's just the Nuremberg code. Only what we learned from the Nazi atrocities, not least those that were medical,"" sarcastically notes esteemed professor, lecturer and podcaster Dr. Jordan Peterson:

In Austria, people over 12 who are not vaccinated are currently almost completely locked down, only allowed outside for absolutely essential tasks like food or medical appointments.
In an interview she gave to the BBC, the EU chief  said that it was ""understandable and appropriate"" to consider vaccine mandates, especially due to the new Omicron variant of COVID 19, which has been now detected in 12 different member nations of the EU.
""How we can encourage and potentially think about mandatory vaccination within the European Union? This needs discussion. This needs a common approach, but it is a discussion that I think has to be led,"" commented Van Der Leyen to the BBC.
The WHO, however, has strongly encouraged countries not to enact travel bans because of Omicron, and further iterated that early data points to the fact that most Omicron cases are not severe. Most of the world's governments are not paying attention to the WHO's guidelines on this occasion, however.
The Nuremberg Code was enacted in 1947, immediately after the Second World War to prevent many of the egregious human rights abuses enacted by the Nazis and the Imperial Japanese during the war.
Especially were at issue the performance of medical procedures on subjects without their consent. These procedures, often performed under the command of people such as Dr. Josef Mengele or Hideki Tojo, often were akin to the worst kinds of torture. Since then, full and proactive ongoing consent has been required.
Reproduced here below is the section of the Nuremberg Code which is in question."
Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_647447,"An NIH whistleblower privy to a telephone Thursday morning telephone call between the corrupt administration and members of the Biden-⁠Harris Administration COVID-⁠19 Health Equity Task Force told Real Raw News that an enraged Kamala Harris called unvaccinated Americans “very dirty Trump people” after CDC Director Rochelle Walensky admitted to the difficulty of vaccinating every American citizen.
Also on the call were NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins—a vaccine pusher who Fox News’ Bret Bair has called “an American hero”—administration Communication Director Kim Bedingfield, Secretary of Health & Human Services Director Xavier Becerra, and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, a self-admitted Communist.
The 25-minute call began with Harris bemoaning “Trump supporters refusing to get vaccinated” and blaming the alleged spread the of Delta and now Omicron Covid-19 variants on Donald J. Trump and his “gang of dirty people.”
Harris launched a sprawling, breathless rant, assailing Trump with every vile name under the sun, and audaciously saying that Hillary Clinton, had she “assumed her rightful place in the White House in 2016,” would have stopped Covid-19 in its tracks before it reached American soil.
“Donald Trump soiled this country, and it’s our responsibility to correct the path. Covid is Trump’s fault; we must press that hard. We must keep him from going into the 2024 primaries. We have other people working other attack angles, but we cannot let Biden or me take blame for even a single fatality. It all started under Trump, so it’s his fault, and it’s his filthy people who, like rats, are spreading this pestilence. That’s the narrative we’re aiming for. We have Dr. Fauci on our side, and most Americans will believe whatever he says,” Harris purportedly said.
Her spurious tirade, our source said, induced a standing ovation, with Collins, Walensky, and Mayorkas pledging to commit their resources to “obliterate” Trump’s chances of returning to the Oval Office. She spent more time blasting Trump than she did discussing ways of mitigating the alleged Omicron variant, which is purely fictional, doctors have told RRN.
No person on the call, our source said, admitted to the Omicron fraud, as they chose their words meticulously. But they indirectly confessed their maleficence by linking the imaginary sickness to supporters of Donald Trump.
“It doesn’t matter if people get sick or not—everyone needs quarterly booster shots. They benefit everyone. If people support Donald Trump, we’re not getting all the shots in the arms that we have to get,” CDC Director Walensky said on the call.
“The unvaccinated are a threat to homeland security,” Mayorkas said. “DHS will keep helping the CDC monitoring the unvaccinated.”
“Trump’s supporters are the problem; they’re dirty,” Kim Bedingfield agreed.
“I wish they’d all just go away,” Harris replied. “They’re all unvaccinated January 6thers waiting to happen.”
In closing, Harris’ plummeting popularity, even among Deep Staters, seems to have earned the Border Czar and chief official of the Covid-19 task force a new responsibility: reigniting liberal hatred of Donald Trump by inventing things for which he was never responsible."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_85152,"CDC data on COVID deaths: 757
Here’s the death toll from COVID deaths for kids 18 and younger: about 750 deaths.

However, if these deaths are anything like adult deaths, these are kids who died with COVID, not from COVID. The actual number who died from COVID is likely a lot smaller. But we’ll be generous and say that all 757 kids died from COVID just for the sake of our argument (since we don’t want to be attacked by the “pro-vaxers”).
VAERS data on vaccine deaths
Now, let’s do the VAERS search to see how the vaccine is doing. Note we limit the search to US only. This is why we get lower numbers than reported in other articles. This is because we don’t cheat. We exclude the foreign reports.
Also, in the two query reports below, the 18 year olds are all put in the category of 17-44. That’s a fixed category for MedAlerts queries. The only deaths there are 18 year olds since it is restricted by the query itself.

Only 35 reports.
However, not all of those deaths are causal! Some are just background deaths. So let’s remove those. Let’s be super conservative (as usual) and just subtract out all the deaths reported in a previous year… that includes background death as well as those deaths associated with vaccines:

OK, 35-3 = 32 deaths that are “excess.”
However, VAERS is 41X underreported, a number computed based on the CDC’s own methodology. When I contacted the CDC asking them if I made an error in my calculation, I just get silence. No reply. It’s a conversation ender. This is the same treatment they gave to Aaron Siri when he computed the URF. They refuse to talk to me, they won’t reply to Siri, and they refuse to supply the “correct” number to any reporters who ask about this. When I try to ask anyone in Congress to ask the CDC for this number, I just get hang ups. Nobody wants to know. I can’t figure out why that is. They know the process. They’ve done it before. But they can’t seem to do it this year for some odd reason.

The “cure” is a lot worse than the “disease”
So we have 1,312 deaths that are highly likely to be caused by the vaccine compared to 757 deaths from COVID.
So we’ve likely killed nearly twice as many kids with the vaccine than have been killed by COVID.
In short, our health authorities have convinced parents that it’s better to increase the chance of your kid dying than to reduce it.
But hey, we’re just getting started since not all the kids under 18 have been vaccinated yet. The authorities are rushing to get all kids vaccinated before anyone figures out what is going on. So expect the numbers to get much higher.
But what about the USA Today “fact check”?

Just so we don’t miss anything, you may ask “what about the USA fact-check?”
I am still looking for one of these fact checks that is actually correct, and so far I’ve come up empty handed.
This one quotes my friend Michael Yeadon who claimed “Children are 50 times more likely to be killed by the COVID vaccines than the virus itself” which is an estimate that probably not far from the truth since virtually all the kids who died “from” COVID are more likely to have died “with COVID.” Virtually all had multiple risk factors. It’s hard to find even a single healthy kid who died from COVID. I don’t know of a single one. Do you? So my guess is that Dr. Yeadon’s statement is either very accurate or not far off.
Ella Lee’s fact check starts off with:
“Clinical trial data shows the COVID-19 vaccines do not pose a risk of death to children.”
WTF? Are you kidding me?!?! I don’t want to seem rude or anything, but do you have a brain? This is about the dumbest statement ever made. I would love to do a video debate with Ella Lee on this. There is no possible way this is true. How can USA Today print this stuff?
To show that, you’d have to run a clinical trial with millions of kids, not 2,000. And even after than you could only say the death risk is less than 1 in a few hundred thousand at best. And we know it poses a huge death risk for adults. There is no doubt about that. So why would it not for children? Is there something in the mechanism of action of the vaccine that limits this? Is there a line of code in the DNA that says, “if under 18, do not kill host?” Heck no.
It then goes on to quote Leana Wen:
“In the U.S., no child has died from the vaccine, but over 600 have died from COVID,” Dr. Leana Wen, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University, said in an email. “(Yeadon’s) claim is completely untrue.”
Look, there is simply no other way to say this: Dr. Leana Wen is full of shit. Her claim is demonstrably false. I’d love to debate her. I’d pay big money to debate her. But while she is happy to appear on CNN for free, no amount of money will persuade her to allow me to interview her.
For more information on child deaths, read this article which talks about a few of the cases in VAERS. It’s pretty shocking."
Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_719244,"A dying nurse has come forward on her deathbed and alleged to have swapped more than 5,000 babies simply for the amusement that such an activity would give her in the moment.
Should this story be believed or is it simply another hoax?
The story’s details are as seemingly fantastical as they are disturbing. Is this the worst maternity ward nurse the world has ever seen?
The Zambia Observer reports that a nurse going by the name of Elizabeth Bwalya Mwewa honed a personal habit of switching up babies for the amusement such an activity would bring her.
The incidents are alleged to have taken place at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia.
The nurse is coming forward now because she’s being eating alive by cancer. She wants to recant and atone as far as possible given the heinous nature of her crimes.
The death-bed confession inspires as many questions as answers.
Can forgiveness be given for someone who has done something like this? Should the adults be notified about the purported mix-up from years gone by?
The Observer found that these incidents span a dozen years from 1983 all the way through to 1995.
The full scope of what this nurse is purported to have done therefore takes on huge proportions in terms of the number of people potentially affected.
The response from social media has been loudly opinionated, almost apoplectic.
The truth, though, may be far more banal since the Lusaka Times couldn’t find any corroborating evidence or records of a nurse going by the name of Mrs. Mwewa in their history.
Establishing such an individual would be the first step in corroborating the story, but this one might be dead on arrival.
What’s curious is that there does appear to be a Mrs. Mwewa out there who is stubbornly keeping with her earlier claim.
To her mind, Mwewa is atoning for some vast, unspeakable crime spree that occurred over a dozen years.
Until further evidence is forthcoming, this story will have to be assigned to the moot category.
Stories about babies switched at birth are sometimes proven to be true and, in that sense, these confessors are vindicated.
Two babies in the Indian state of Assam were said to be swapped in 2015, and that story was later found to be true, though shocking.
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction, indeed. Nonetheless, Mrs. Mwewa remains adamant."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_Social media_672898,Watch: Boy passes Joe Biden a vial of fresh blood to drink on his way back to the White House
Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_182076,"The Canadian COVID Care Alliance (CCCA) — a group of over 500 independent Canadian doctors, scientists and healthcare practitioners committed to providing evidence-based information to the public about COVID — sent an amazing slide deck to The Vault Project revealing the dangers of Pfizer’s COVID vaccine and flaws with its clinical trials.
The data was shocking and raises questions as to how U.S. regulatory agencies could ever approve Pfizer’s COVID vaccine for use in humans.

According to the document, it normally takes 5 to 10 years to develop a vaccine. In rare circumstances, it can be done in as little as 5 years. However, Pfizer did not follow established protocols. The pharmaceutical giant skipped animal testing, mislabeled specimens, falsified data, failed to follow participants who reported adverse events, combined Phase II/III clinical trials, only presented two months of data before requesting Emergency Use Authorization, combined results of multiple trials to make the vaccine look more effective, unblinded their clinical trials and will not complete Phase III trials until 2023.
The original clinical trial that started it all
Pfizer’s original trial report was published on Dec. 31, 2020, in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) (the editor-in-chief sits of the NEJM sits on the FDA’s vaccine advisory panel that determines whether a COVID vaccine is recommended by the way). Pfizer claimed, based on only two months of data, that its vaccine was safe and effective showing a 95% efficacy seven days after the second dose.
But that 95% was actually something termed “relative risk reduction.” Absolute risk reduction was only 0.84%.

Absolute risk reduction is the number of percentage points your own risk goes down if you do something protective. Relative risk reduction tells you by how much the treatment reduced the risk of bad outcomes relative to the control group who did not have the treatment. 

Simply put, absolute risk reduction is the only way to identify the true context of something reported in a clinical trial, and is the most useful way of presenting research results to help guide decision-making. However, Pfizer ignored absolute risk reduction when boasting about the efficacy of its vaccine.

Pfizer’s report on the efficacy of its mRNA vaccine through 6 months showed an efficacy of 91.3% — which means it reduced positive cases compared to the placebo group. However, it also showed an increase in illness and deaths. So any perceived (temporary) benefit the vaccine may have provided, comes at a cost of increased harm.
For example, the group during the clinical trial that received Pfizer’s COVID vaccine had a 300% risk change with related adverse events compared to the placebo group, 75% risk change with severe adverse events and a 10% risk change serious adverse events involving the ER or hospitalization.
During Pfizer’s clinical trial, data shows a total of 20 deaths in the group that received the vaccine compared to 14 deaths in the placebo group. After unblinding the participants, 3 in the Pfizer group died and 2 in the placebo group died. At least nine deaths in the Pfizer group were related to cardiovascular events.
Misleading demographics
According to CCCA, when designing a trial for the efficacy and safety of a potential treatment, the focus should have be on the target population who could benefit most from the treatment. In the case of COVID vaccines, this would be those aged 72 and older. Instead, Pfizer chose participants in the younger age groups who would be less likely to need a vaccine and less likely to suffer an adverse event during the trial. In addition, a younger person is more likely to respond well to a vaccine compared to an elderly person.
Only 4% of Pfizer’s trial subjects were over the age of 75.
Pfizer says its vaccine is safe, but the company only tested its vaccine in mostly healthy, young people. Statistics show that 95% of people who’ve died from COVID had at least one co-morbidity. In the Pfizer trial, only 21% had a co-morbidity.
People with allergies, psychiatric conditions, immunocompromised people, pregnant women, people with bleeding disorders, people with natural immunity, etc. were excluded from clinical trials, yet a fourth dose of Pfizer’s COVID vaccine is being pushed on the immunocompromised and vaccines are mandated for those who’ve already had COVID.
Pfizer failed to test all participants for COVID
Pfizer’s clinical trial did not test all participants for COVID. Instead, investigators were instructed to test only those with symptoms. This means asymptomatic infection was missed and results are unreliable due to the high level of subjectivity investigators had and their ability to manipulate results.
In fact, there was no evidence at all that Pfizer’s COVID vaccine reduces the spread or transmission of COVID. It wasn’t even a “study endpoint” during the clinical trial.
Pfizer’s missing data
Pfizer is missing data for thousands of participants (many of whom were suspected to have COVID in the vaccinated group but weren’t tested), which, if included would have reduced the relative risk reduction to 19% — less than the 50% eligible for (Emergency Use Authorization) EUA.
Pfizer mixed cohorts to boost efficacy numbers
According to CCCA, Pfizer also took results from their adult trial, which began on July 27, 2020, and added them to the results of the 12-15-year-olds; trial, despite that adolescent trial starting four months later. The result was boosted efficacy numbers.
Pfizer failed to properly track adverse events
Pfizer should have tested for antibodies and tracked adverse events in terms of symptoms, but they didn’t test for adverse events at the subclinical (pre-symptom) level. According to CCCA, this is problematic because symptoms/diseases are typically endpoints of processes that take months, years or even decades to surface.
Pfizer failed to track biomarkers (like d-dimers for evidence of blood clotting disorders, c-reactive protein for evidence of inflammation, troponin levels for heart damage, etc.) that would have been early warning indicators for disease caused by their vaccine.
When participants were actively followed during the clinical trial, a high number of adverse events were reported. When the vaccine was rolled out, passive surveillance was used and the signal was lost.
Adolescent trial of 12- to 15-year-olds showed all risk, zero benefit
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is now recommended for the 12- to 15-year-old age group and studies for boosters are underway. Yet, Pfizer’s study of adolescents aged 12 to 15 was too small to show risk and showed no benefit — only 1,005 participants were vaccinated and 978 received the placebo.
Pfizer boasted great results but the adolescents they tested were at a statistically 0% risk of death from COVID, so receiving the vaccine wouldn’t have benefited them in the first place. What the vaccine did do was increase the risk of adverse events, which the clinical trial wasn’t designed to detect.
There was at least one very serious adverse event — Maddie de Garay (age 12). “Maddie developed gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting, erratic blood pressure, memory loss, brain fog, headaches, dizziness, fainting, seizures, verbal and motor tics, menstrual cycle issues, lost feeling from the waist down, lost bowel and bladder control and had a nasogastric tube placed because she lost her ability to eat. For the past 10 months, she has been in a wheelchair and fed via tube. “
In Pfizer’s report, her adverse reaction was described as “functional abdominal pain.”
Pfizer also used predictive modeling and stated their vaccine will cause myocarditis but said there would be zero deaths. Yet, this violates the first principle of medicine (do no harm) and science shows a mortality rate of 20% at 6.5 years in those who have myocarditis.
Pfizer continues to advertise their vaccine as safe and effective, but data is lacking and they even admit their clinical trial was too small to detect rare side effects. In addition, Pfizer changed their vaccine formula, so the vaccine that was used in the clinical trial was not the one ultimately approved for EUA (nor is it the same as the licensed Comirnaty vaccine that is not used in the U.S.).
Pfizer’s concerning post marketing pharmacovigilance report
On Nov. 17, 2021, the FDA released the first batch of what will ultimately be a 329,000-page document the agency hopes to produce over the next 75 years. A group called the Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency requested access the data FDA used to approve Pfizer’s COIVD vaccines.
One post-marketing pharmacovigilance report submitted to the FDA where Pfizer tracked real-world adverse events during the first 2.5 months after EUA showed over 1,200 deaths, 25,000 nervous system adverse events, and under “safety concerns,” listed “vaccine-associated enhanced disease.”
Pfizer’s financial incentives and lawsuits
Pfizer is poised to make more than $36 billion from their COVID vaccine in 2021. Their bottom line is their shareholders — not public health — and they have a long history of lying, misleading the public and engaging in unscrupulous practices.
On July 2, 1994, a unit of Pfizer Inc. agreed to pay $10.75 million to settle Justice Department claims it lied to get federal approval for a mechanical heart valve that fractured, killing hundreds of patients worldwide.
On May 14, 2004, Pfizer pled guilty and agreed to pay $430 million to resolve criminal and civil charges it paid doctors to prescribe its epilepsy drug, Neurontin, to patients with ailments the drug was not federally approved to treat.
On July 3, 2004, Pfizer reached a $60 million settlement of a class-action lawsuit over its Rezulin diabetes drug, which was withdrawn from the market after about 100 people who took it had to have liver transplants or died from acute liver failure.
On Oct. 8, 2008, experts concluded Pfizer “manipulated the publication of scientific studies to bolster the use of its epilepsy drug Neurontin for other disorders, while suppressing research that did not support those uses,” according to experts who reviewed thousands of company documents in a lawsuit against the company.
On Sept. 2, 2009, Pfizer paid $2.3 billion, the largest health care fraud settlement in the history of the Department of Justice, to resolve criminal and civil liability arising from the fraudulent marketing of certain pharmaceutical products.
On April 1, 2010, a Pfizer spokesperson revealed they had paid $20 million to 4,500 doctors and other medical professionals within a six-month period. Pfizer also paid $15.3 million to 250 academic medical centers and other research groups for clinical trials in the same period.
On Aug. 12, 2011, Pfizer paid out settlements to Nigerian families whose children were killed during a meningitis drug trial. Many others were paralyzed, maimed or injured.
On Aug. 7, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Pfizer with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when its subsidiaries bribed doctors and other health care professionals employed by foreign governments in order to win business.
On Aug. 7, 2012, Pfizer paid $60 million to settle allegations it bribed doctors and health care professionals employed by foreign governments in order to win business and increase sales.
On Dec. 9, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court left intact a $142 million jury verdict against Pfizer over the marketing of the epilepsy drug Neurontin.
On Dec. 7, 2016, Britain’s competition watchdog fined a record 84.2 million pounds ($107 million) for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600%.
On July 15, 2021, Pfizer and two of its subsidiaries agreed to pay $345 million under a proposed settlement to resolve lawsuits over EpiPen price hikes.
On Oct. 15, 2021, a federal court denied requests by Pfizer and other companies to throw out lawsuits by former Zantac patients asking for medical monitoring and compensation for their financial losses. Lawsuits alleging personal injury from the drug can continue as well.

“Manufacturers including GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, Boehringer Ingelheim and Pfizer engaged in a decades-long scheme to conceal the inherent dangers and risks associated with Zantac use despite abundant medical and scientific literature that linked ranitidine to NDMA, and we look forward to holding them accountable,” lawyers for the plaintiffs said in a statement.
Pfizer’s conflict of interests
According to CCCA research, 84% of authors who signed on to Pfizer-BioNTech’s 6-month clinical trial study had conflicts of interest, leaving only 16% who didn’t. At least two authors saw their sock value increase by $9 billion due to the results of the study.
CDC redefined “vaccine” for pharmaceutical and political interests
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) used to define “vaccine” as a “product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease.” This was the definition the CDC used for years.
On July 27, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, admitted COVID vaccines do not provide immunity and do not prevent people from catching or transmitting COVID. This presented a problem, so on Sept. 2, the CDC changed its definition for “vaccine” to “a preparation that is used to stimulate the body’s immune response against diseases.”
Pfizer indemnified, vaccines should be withdrawn immediately
Pfizer has been shielded from liability for harm caused by its COVID vaccine(s), and agencies overseeing trials are failing to follow established high-quality safety and efficacy protocols, despite knowing based on available data Pfizer’s COVID vaccine could cause harm.
“Any government official who possesses this evidence and continues to allow its citizens to be inoculated with a toxic agent is, at the very least, negligent,” CCCA wrote.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_715199,"On Monday, the criminal Biden administration and its complicit states’ governors activated a program that deployed 1,000 military medical workers to six U.S. states to help hospitals besieged by an imaginary crisis—a non-existent surge of Omicron patients.
But physicians attached to the New Jersey Army National Guard, Task Force Secaucus, found their assigned location, Hudson Regional Hospital, empty of even a single Covid patient, said Lt. Michael McKenzie, a physician assistant.
Lt. McKenzie and 11 other Guardsmen—doctors, nurses, and physician assistants—were dispatched to the hospital with the impression its ICU was at-capacity and packed with deathly ill Omicron patients. Their duty was to relieve “overwhelmed” hospital staff, so the hospital’s existing medical professionals could focus their attention on non-Omicron patients.
“We were all surprised. I mean—we got told Omicron patients inundated the hospital. That’s not what we saw. Four of the hospital’s 14 ICU beds were occupied, but none with Covid patients,” Lt. McKenzie told Real Raw News.
The Guardsmen, he added, examined each patient’s medical chart. Not one mentioned Covid-19 as a reason for hospital admission. Two were cardiac patients. One had taken a gunshot wound to the abdomen. The other had been admitted for maladies not linked to Covid-19.
Interestingly, Lt. McKenzie said he was present when his CO asked hospital administrators why, if the hospital had no Covid patients, the National Guardsmen were there at all, as their orders expressly stated they were at the hospital to mitigate an Omicron surge.
“CO got told ‘I have nothing to do with your men being here. You’re here, I guess, because President Biden and Governor Phil Murphy want you here. Personally, I view your presence at this hospital a disruption and an inconvenience.’ CO made some phone calls. I guess he told his CO weren’t any Covid cases here, but we were told to stay at the hospital,” Lt. McKenzie said.
Moreover, not only was the hospital devoid of Covid-19 patients, but it was also short on staff. Lt. McKenzie said he saw “hardly any” hospital doctors or nurses patrolling the labyrinth of corridors or peeking their heads in patients’ rooms. Curious, he took it upon himself to discretely question a nurse and an orderly as to why Hudson Regional was short-staffed. He got two disparate answers.
“First, I was told many doctors and nurses had Omicron themselves and had to isolate at home until they tested negative. Then I got told the staffing issue was because the hospital fired 1/3 of its staff for refusing to get vaccinated. One thing’s for sure: someone isn’t telling the truth,” Lt. McKenzie said.
In closing, RRN reached out to both the NJ Army National Guard and Hudson Regional for comments. A Guard spokesperson refused to comment, and a member of the hospital’s administrative staff, Beth Johnson, said, “It’s hospital policy to not give specific information on who is hospitalized here or why. I can tell you 7 of 14 ICU beds are in use.”
Her statement alone contradicts Gov. Murphy’s assertion that Hudson Regional is “at capacity.”
Note: For those curious, Cheney’s tribunal did not begin until this morning, 10:00 a.m. GITMO time. I probably will not receive an update until late tonight and will publish on it tomorrow morning.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_243332,"Our president often doesn’t seem to be “all there” mentally. Though he was somehow elected president, his brain seems mushier than the lukewarm oatmeal he eats in the morning while hiding out in the White House basement, which makes it all the more interesting to see what weird thing he’s doing or up to in photos and videos of him bumbling about.


 
Recently, one such photo dropped, with Biden posting this ridiculously awkward photo on Twitter:

It’s almost as bad as that one where he looks like a giant compared to Jimmy Carter.


 
But, beyond him looking like a mummy in Genocide Olympics-branded clothes, people online noticed something: what’s in his right hand?

When you zoom in, what looks like a cellphone at first glance appears more like something with a large, rubber antennae. Here’s a zoomed-in photo of it:




 
What is that thing? It’s hard to tell, but, as reported on Wayne Dupree’s site, many suspect it’s a medical device of some sort:

“Is that a medical alert item in his hand? It looks like it has two antennas.”

Or perhaps it’s a walkie-talkie, though why the president would be holding one is unknown.

Beyond the medical device comment, Dupree reports that other speculation about the photo abounded, both about what he’s holding and whether the picture was photoshopped. Here are some of those comments:

“If Jill makes one move, Joe topples over”

“Weekend At Bernie’s- What flunky photoshopped this?”

“Why is Joe barely standing up like this?”

“It looks like Jill is holding this old geezer up”

“They look like two idiots in those outfits. Especially the dementia patient.”

“This photo looks really fake”

“Why is everything these two do so damn weird and unnatural?”

“Did you get free crack pipes with those nice jackets Cornpop?”

“A photoshopped JOKE PHOTO!!! How sick is this?!?!”

“This looks so photoshopped! Everything they do is disingenuous!”

Though it’s probably not fake, those commenters have a good point: it’s a weird photo and Joe looks very…well, plastic. Beyond the unknown, weird object in his hand, likely either a medical device or walkie-talkie, he and Jill are standing in a bizarre way.

It’s hard to describe what exactly is wrong with the picture, but something obviously isn’t quite right.

Now, that doesn’t mean the conspiracy theorists are right and it was photoshopped. Far more likely is that Joe is just completely out of it and is standing in an odd manner. “Dr.” Jill looks pretty normal, after all.

But, more important than any of the speculation is the fact that it exists and has to be taken at least somewhat seriously, as Joe is so darn mentally mushy.

Trump had his faults, but at least he was “there” enough mentally that people weren’t seriously speculating that he had to be photoshopped into a weird picture while holding a life alert button. Joe, on the other hand…such speculation about him is so real that it hurts."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_842585,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday told President Trump that Russia’s military destroyed a multitude of foreign bioweapon facilities that had been running carte blanche in Ukraine until his military took decisive and strategic action to rid the corrupt nation of what he called satanic influence, a Mar-a-Lago source told Real Raw News.
As much of the nation sat glued to televisions and computers watching the illegitimate president’s State of the Union Address—in a room half-filled with imposters—Putin and Trump, from his Mar-a-Lago command center, spent a 20-minute phone call once more discussing the Russian leader’s true reasons for mounting an assault on Ukrainian sovereignty.
Putin spent the first half of the call updating Trump on his efforts to destroy Western-sponsored biolabs in Ukraine, which he called a “blight” on a once beautiful landscape. According to Putin, who in 7 days has become the world’s vilest villain, supplanting Xi Jinping, the Russian military had obliterated the following: 11 U.S. State Department/Department of Defense-funded bioweapon facilities; 4 German toxic chemical research centers; 3 Swiss nanotechnology centers; 1 French bio-tech consortium; and 3 Israeli labs that were feverishly working to weaponize airborne rabies. Additionally, Putin claimed his forces had carried out precision strikes on mobile (18-wheelers unsafely retrofitted into makeshift labs) biolabs attempting to transport lethal pathogens across the Ukrainian border into Poland. He told Trump that Russian SU-35 planes used laser-guided munitions to eliminate the roving labs.
Moreover, Putin said his fighter planes had destroyed a Biden-owned, 200-acre villa 35km west of Kyiv. He insisted that Biden was deeply enmeshed in Ukraine’s criminal enterprises, and promised Trump that he’d soon give the world “all the evidence it needs.” Furthermore, Putin contended that “many people within Biden’s demonic den” profited massively from the “conflagration of evil” that had rooted itself on Ukrainian soil. Twenty of Biden’s foreign cohorts, Putin said, were killed in the attack.
Additionally, Putin continued to denounce stories of his insanity as Western propaganda, and refuted tales of mass defections, or of his convoys running short of fuel and food. Also, he rebuked Western assertions that his troops were committing war crimes by indiscriminately bombing and shelling innocent civilians.
“President Trump, you know what fake news is. This is all fake news. Your media shows the same three pictures of videos over and over again, 24-hours a day, to make false claims I am doing some genocide. Your country’s own intelligence sources admit I’ve sent only 75 planes and no UAVs. If I wanted to conquer Ukraine, I’d send 1,000 planes. You know what real invasion looks like. Go look video footage of America ‘Shock and Awe’ in Iraq. That’s an invasion. I could if I want to, but that’s not my objective,” Putin reportedly told Trump.
The second part of the call focused on Putin’s attempts to find, isolate, and wipe out child trafficking covens that had been running with impunity in Ukraine, an operation that began after Russian Special Forces, while searching for weapons of mass destruction, stumbled upon a brick building filled with captive children.
“What Putin told Trump—his people found another three locations, each with 25-60 kids inside. None were American, apparently, but still they were from a lot of different countries. Two of the three, at least Putin said, were guarded by Ukrainians, and his Spetznas killed them and freed the kids. Then they set explosive and detonated the camps. Much has been made of Russia killing five people in an attack on a television station in Kyiv. If Putin’s telling the truth, and I’m certainly not saying he is, the Ukrainian government and child trafficking cartels were using that spot as a means of communication,” our source said.
Asked how much faith Trump has in Putin’s overall honesty, our source said: “Trump takes nothing for granted, he measures everything carefully. We know at least two American children held hostage in Ukraine are now on their way home. Trump is always evaluating and calculating what’s going on.”"
Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_307476,"AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged.
People with acquired immune deficiency syndrome are at an increased risk for developing certain cancers and for infections that usually occur only in individuals with a weak immune system.
Here we present a series of strong evidence that the Covid-19 vaccines are causing recipients to develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or a novel condition with similar attributes that can only be described as Covid-19 Vaccine Induced Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (VAIDS).

Exhibit A
Vaccine Effectiveness doesn’t wane; Immune System Performance does
Vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipients immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.
The first time the body encounters a germ, it can take several days to make and use all the germ-fighting tools needed to get over the infection. After the infection, the immune system remembers what it learned about how to protect the body against that disease.
Vaccines allegedly help develop immunity by imitating an infection. Once the imitation infection induced by the vaccine goes away, the body is left with a supply of “memory” t-cells and antibodies that will remember how to fight that disease in the future
So, when the authorities state that the effectiveness of the vaccines weaken over time, what they really mean is that the performance of your immune system weakens over time.
In regards to the Covid-19 injections –
A vaccine effectiveness of +50% would mean that the fully vaccinated are 50% more protected against Covid-19 than the unvaccinated. In other words the fully vaccinated have an immune system that is 50% better at tackling Covid-19.
A vaccine effectiveness of 0% would mean that the fully vaccinated are no more protected against Covid-19 than the unvaccinated, meaning the vaccines are ineffective. In other words the fully vaccinated have an immune system that is equal to that of the unvaccinated at tackling Covid-19.
Buta vaccine effectiveness of -50% would mean that the unvaccinated were 50% more protected against Covid-19 than the fully vaccinated. In other words the immune system performance of the vaccinated is 50% worse than the natural immune system performance of the unvaccinated. Therefore, the Covid-19 vaccines have damaged the immune system.

Exhibit B
UK Data shows the Covid-19 Vaccines have a real-world Negative Effectiveness
The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) publishes a weekly Vaccine Surveillance Report, with each report containing four weeks worth of data on Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths by vaccination status.
Here are the Covid-19 case-rates per 100,000 by vaccination status for each age group over the age of 18 in England, plus the average case rate per 100,000 for all adults in England taken from the UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance Report – Week 5 – 2022 –
This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-110-1024x756.png
As you can see the case-rate per 100k is clearly lowest among the unvaccinatied population in all age groups, with case rates among the triple vaccined population approximately double the rate seen among the unvaccinated in most age groups, and case rates among the double vaccinated population approximately triple the rate seen among the unvaccinated in most age groups.
This data alone should deeply concern even the most avid vaccine advocates.
Now that we know the case-rates, we can use Pfizer’s vaccine effectiveness formula to work out the real-world vaccine effectiveness.
Unvaccinated case rate – Vaccinated case rate / Unvaccinated case rate = Vaccine Effectiveness
e.g. Double Vaccinated 18-80+: 1,846.38 – 5,226.1 / 1,846.38 = minus-183%
Therefore, the average real-world Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness in England for all adults as a whole in January 2022 was MINUS-183%.
Here’s how effective the Covid-19 vaccines are proving to be in each double vaccinated age group –
The lowest Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness was seen in the 40-49 age group in England throughout January 2022, recorded at minus-209.4%, with the 50-59 age group not far behind.
But don’t forget, as we proved with the evidence presented in Exhibit A, Vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipients immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.
Therefore, the UKHSA data actually shows that the Covid-19 injections are decimating the natural immune system.

Exhibit C
UK Data actually shows the Fully Vaccinated have a Negative Immune System Performance
To work out immune system performance we have to alter the calculation used to work out vaccine effectiveness slightly and divide our answer by either the largest of the vaccinated or unvaccinated case rate as per the case rates provided in Exhibit B.
Unvaccinated case rate – Vaccinated case rate / largest of the unvaccinated / vaccinated case rate = Immune System Performancee.g. Double Vaccinated 18-80+: 1,846.38 – 5,226.1 / 5,226.1 = minus-65%
The following chart shows the true extent of the damage caused to the double vaccinated populations immune systems by age group in January 2022 –
This means the average double vaccinated person in England is down to the last 35% of their immune system for fighting viruses, bacteria, and cancers. But is this data just a one off, or is the performance of the fully vaccinated populations immune system declining by the week?

Exhibit D
UK Data proves the Fully Vaccinated Populations Immune System Performance is declining by the week
If we take the case rates found in previous UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance reports we’re able to track the real world vaccine effectiveness and immune system performance of the vaccinated over the past few months.
So we took the case rates found in the following reports –
Covid-19 Vaccine Surveillance Report – Week 37′ (Published by PHE)
‘Covid-19 Vaccine Surveillance Report – Week 41’ (Published by UKHSA)
‘Covid-19 Vaccine Surveillance Report – Week 45’ (Published by UKHSA)
‘Covid-19 Vaccine Surveillance Report – Week 49’ (Published by UKHSA)
‘Covid-19 Vaccine Surveillance Report – Week 1 – 2022’ (Published by UKHSA)
And then calculated the real world Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness between 16th August 2021 and 2nd January 2022 –
The first booster shots were administered in week 37 of 2021, and this graph illustrates clearly how they provided a boost in vaccine effectiveness in the following two months. But unfortunately it also shows how short lived this boost was with the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines falling to frightening levels between week 49 and 52.
The following graph illustrates the overall immune system performance among all age groups in England between 16th Aug 21 and 2nd Jan 22 –
As you can see from the above the 40-49 year-olds had the worst immune system performance by the 2nd Jan 22, recorded at minus-60%. In Exhibit C we shows that the immune system performance in 40-49-year-olds had declined to minus-67.7% by the 30th January 22. This therefore proves the Covid-19 vaccines are causing damage to the natural immune system that worsens by the week.

Exhibit E
UK data shows the Fully Vaccinated are now more likely to die of Covid-19
The following chart shows the Covid-19 death-rates per 100,000 by vaccination status for each age group over the age of 18 in England, calculated from the number of deaths found in the week 5 UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance Report and the size of the double vaccinated population –
The double vaccinated population have the highest death rate per 100k in every age group except for the 18-29, and 40-49-year-olds. But we can expect in coming weeks for that rate to switch among the two anomalies based on Exhibit D proving things get worse for the vaccinated population by the week.

Exhibit F
UK Data shows the Covid-19 Vaccines have a real-world Negative Effectiveness against Death
Now that we know the death-rates, we can again use Pfizer’s vaccine effectiveness formula to work out the real-world vaccine effectiveness against death.
Real world Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness against death in England between 3rd Jan and 30th Jan 22 was as low as -110.24% in the over 80’s, -97% in people aged 70-79, and -98.14% on average in all adults over age 18.
But don’t forget, as we proved in Exhibit A, vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipients immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.

Exhibit G
UK data suggests some of the Elderly may have already developed VAIDS
The following chart shows the fully vaccinated populations immune system performance against death according to the Covid-19 death-rates per 100,000 found in the UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance Report – Week 5 – 2022 –
This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-120-1024x795.png
Keeping in line with historical trends that show the Covid-19 vaccines have caused damage to the immune system that worsens by the week we can see that the lowest immune system performance is among those who were vaccinated first, with the over 80’s recording an immune system performance of -52.4%, and then the 70-79 age group recording an immune system performance of -49.2%.
There is however a concerning anomaly in this data in that we should expect to see a positive immune system performance among the 30-39 age group of around 29%, but instead it is currently at -15.4%. There could be several explanations for this but none of them are good.
Either the 30-39 year-olds are genuinely doing worse, or all other age groups are doing much worse than what we are being told.
Either way we can be sure that the data is reliably telling us the Covid-19 injections have caused some of the elderly and vulnerable to lose all immune system capability to the point that they are now more likely to die of Covid-19 than an unvaccinated person.

Exhibit H
Public Health Scotland data shows the Fully Vaccinated are now more likely to die of Covid-19
Public Health Scotland publish a weekly Covid-19 Statistical Report containing data on Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status.
The following chart shows the percentage of Covid-19 deaths by vaccination status in Scotland between 25th Dec 21 and 21st Jan 22, according to the report they published Wednesday 2nd February –
The following graph shows the age standardised Covid-19 death rates per 100,000 individuals by vaccination status in Scotland. The data has been extracted from table 16, found on page 54 of the PHS Covid-19 Statistical report published Wednesday 2nd Feb 22.
In the most recent week ending 21st Jan the fully vaccinated were statistically over twice as likely to die of Covid-19 than the unvaccinated.
The highest death-rate in the past month among the fully vaccinated was recorded as 15.49 per 100,000 individuals in the week beginning 15th Jan. But the highest death rate among the unvaccinated came in the week beginning 8th Jan at 10..93 per 100,000.

Exhibit I
Public Health Scotland Data shows the Covid-19 Vaccines have a real-world Negative Effectiveness against Death
The following chart shows the real-world vaccine effectiveness against death over the past four weeks according to figures supplied by Public Health Scotland –
Vaccine effectiveness against death has been negative since at least Dec 25th, and has dropped to a staggering minus-112% as of the 21st Jan 22.
But again don’t forget, as we proved in Exhibit A, vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipients immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.

Exhibit J
Public Health Scotland data suggests some of the Fully Vaccinated may have already developed VAIDS
The following chart shows the average immune system performance of all fully vaccinated adults against death between 15th Jan and 21st Jan 22 according to figures supplied by Public Health Scotland –
The average immune system performance against death among all adults equates to -53% in Scotland, which is slightly ahead of the average -50% seen in England as presented in Exhibit G. Because vaccination began at the same time we would expect these to be around the same.
This therefore means that we can be assured the data is reliably telling us the Covid-19 injections are not just ineffective, but damage the immune system to the point that the recipients are developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and are much more likely to die than the unvaccinated population.

Exhibit K
Government of Canada Data confirms the Covid-19 Vaccines are decimating the Immune Sytem
The following chart shows the number of cases by vaccination status between 5th Dec 21 and 15th Jan 22, once we simply subtract the 4th Dec figures from the 15th Jan figures in the Government of Canada Covid-19 Daily Epidemiological Updates –
In Canada, according to the 4th Dec report, 22.2 million people are at least double vaccinated, and 23.2 million people are at least partly vaccinated. According to official statistics, the population of Canada in 2020 was estimated to be 38.01 million.
Therefore, because 23.1 million people in Canada have had at least a single dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, this leaves approximately 14.81 million people in Canada who are not vaccinated against Covid-19.
The following chart shows the Covid-19 case-rate per 100k by vaccination status in Cnada based on the population size and the case numbers provided above –
The following chart shows the real-world Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness in Canada betwen 5th Dec 21 and 15th Jan 22 based on the case-rate figures above –
But don’t forget, as we proved in Exhibit A, vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipients immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.
The following chart shows the immune system performance of the fully vaccinated population in Canada between 5th Dec 21 and 15th Jan 22 –
The average fully vaccinated Canadian is down to the last 18.45% of their immune system for fighting certain classes of viruses and certain cancers etc. This is what vaccination has done to the people of Canada.

Exhibit L
The Fully Vaccinated are incapable of producing N antibodies
The UK Health Security Agency has found the vaccine interferes with the body’s innate ability after infection to produce antibodies against not just the spike protein but other pieces of the virus. Specifically, vaccinated people don’t seem to be producing antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein, the shell of the virus, which are a crucial part of the response in unvaccinated people.

Exhibit M
Scientific Study finds the Covid-19 Vaccines suppress the innate Immune System
The study titled ‘Innate Immune Suppression by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccinations: The role of G-quadruplexes, exosomes and microRNAs‘ was published on the 21st Jan 22, and presents a raft of evidence that the genetic modifications introduced by the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have diverse consequences to human health.
a potentially direct causal link to neurodegenerative disease;
myocarditis;
immune thrombocytopenia;
Bell’s palsy;
liver disease;
impaired adaptive immunity;
increased production or formation of a tumour or tumours;
and DNA damage
A full breakdown of the study can be read here.

Exhibit N
Scientific Study finds Covid-19 Vaccine linked Cancer Rates are sky high
The following table taken from the study in Exhibit L shows the number of events in the VAERS database from 1990 to 12th Dec 2021, where several terms indicating cancer occurred in association with the Covid-19 vaccine or with all other available vaccines, along with the ratio between the two counts.
There were three times as many reports of breast cancer following a COVID-19 vaccine, and more than six times the number of reports of B-cell lymphoma. All but one of the cases of follicular lymphomawere associated with COVID-19 vaccines.
Pancreatic carcinoma was more than three times as high. Overall, in the above table, twice as many cancer reports to VAERS are related to a COVID-19 vaccination compared to those related to all other vaccines. That, in the study authors opinions constitutes a signal in urgent need of investigation.
This cannot be explained by reference to a disproportionately large number of people receiving an mRNAvaccination in the past year compared to all other vaccinations.
We know this because CDC data shows that between 2008 and 2020 over 1.72 billion doses of the flu vaccine were administered in the USA. Whereas from the start of the Covid-19 vaccination campaign up to 28th Jan 22 there were a total of 549.9 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine administered in the USA.
The reason for this increase in rates of cancer linked to vaccination could well be because the Covid-19 vaccines are decimating the innate immune system as we’ve proved in several Exhibits. By doing so the immune system is unable to fight other infections that can cause cancer.
For instance, HPV (human papillomavirus) infection has been linked to certain head and neck cancers, anal, and cervical cancer, as well as many other kinds of cancer. Lymphoma has been linked to viral infections, too.
You can read a full list of AIDS-related cancers here.

Closing Arguments
Official Government data from England, Scotland and Canada proves that the Covid-19 injections have a real-world negative effectiveness.
But vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipients immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.
This means the fully vaccinated population immune systems are actually inferior to the natural immune systems of the unvaccinated population.
But as we’ve clearly shown this immune system degradation is something that is getting worse by the week, and has now started to result in a negative immune system performance against death among the elderly and vulnerable in England and Scotland.
A recent scientific study has also found that the Covid-19 vaccines suppress the innate immune system with genetic modifications introduced by the jabs having diverse consequences to human health that include immune thrombocytopenia and myocarditis. Both of which are autoimmune diseases.
The same study also found an increased production or formation of tumours, which is again linked to a supressed immune system that is incapable of combating certain viruses that can cause cancer.
AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged.
People with acquired immune deficiency syndrome are at an increased risk for developing certain cancers and for infections that usually occur only in individuals with a weak immune system.
We therefore propose that the Covid-19 injections are causing either acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or a new novel condition with similar attributes than can only be described as Covid-19 Vaccine Induced Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (VAIDS)."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_Social media_166953,"The word ""alcohol"" is said to come from the Arabic term ""Al-khul"" which means ""BODY-EATING SPIRIT"" (also, is the origin of the term"" ghoul"").
In alchemy, alcohol is used to extract the soul essence of an entity. Hence its' use in extracting essences for essential oils, and the sterilization of medical instruments. By consuming alcohol into the body, it in effect extracts the very essence of the soul, allowing the body to be more susceptible to neighboring entities most of which are of low frequencies. (why do you think we call certain alcoholic beverages ""SPIRITS""). That is why people who consume excessive amounts of alcohol often black out, not remembering what happened. This happens when the good soul (we were sent here with) leaves because the living conditions are too polluted and too traumatic to tolerate. The good soul jettisons the body, staying connected on a tether, and a dark entity takes the body for a joy ride around the block, often in a hedonistic and self serving illogical rampage. Our bodies are cars for spirits. If one leaves, another can take the car for a ride.
Essentially when someone goes dark after drinking alcohol or polluting themselves in many other ways, their body often becomes possessed by another entity. Have you ever felt different, more sexual, more violent, less rational and less logical.........after drinking alcohol? Are you aware we already live inside an ancient religious cult who are schooled concerning the dark powers of alcohol? It is this cult that popularizes alcohol, through the media and government it controls, to serve a very ancient and dark agenda.
The solutions to our crumbling society are only to be found within our non polluted collective humanity, not within modern science and the death cult it represents, Our dark and immoral human farmers masquerade as altruistic governments, who then serve us up to dark spiritual entities that feed off our energies when we consume alcohol and a host of other toxic substances they rain down from the top of the ruling pyramid. We're slaves living on an elaborate control grid.....based on indoctrination, propaganda, chemical sedation, toxic medication and we're even used as food energy for dark spirits who live outside the frequency of visible sight. I haven't drank alcohol in almost 5 years. Now, the dark spirits are in fear of me and that's the way it was always meant to be. Join the moral rebirth of humanity, un-slave, reject the poison and lets get to work doing what we know has to be done.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_672810,"On what he said would be his final update until the war was won, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday told Donald J. Trump that he had ordered the execution of 12 international bioweapon engineers whom Russian forces had captured in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, said a Mar-a-Lago source privy to the conversation.
Putin referred to the engineers as transnational criminals, saying Ukraine would no longer be a breeding ground for Western “pestilence,” a word he has often used to reference bioweapon facilities and child trafficking syndicates.
In what could rightfully be called a communal execution, his military commanders had assembled the 12 criminals and, on Putin’s orders, beheaded them one by one. Each of the condemned, except the last to die, was forced to watch the brutal, grisly scene. Many pleaded for their lives as they watched in horror their associates’ heads being sawed off at the neck. Some tried to shut their eyes, but Russian soldiers forced those eyes open with their thumbs. Half of the group pissed themselves before their heads were lopped off.
Putin said he had captured them alive because he wanted to send a clear, undiluted message to the CEOs of bioweapon consortiums that had manufactured weapons of mass destruction on Ukrainian soil.
“Putin told Trump the executions were videoed, that he’s going to send the video to the people responsible for building those labs. He also said two American ‘filth and scum’ were among the group killed, that a video of their beheading would be shipped to DARPA,” our source said.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is a research and development agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military. Putin alleged that DARPA had controlled two biologic/chemical research facilities in central Ukraine.
“This is how we do it in Russia, President Trump. No lengthy trial, no tribunal to waste time. We know these men were guilty because we caught them; if they were innocent, we would not go after them. I am not sorry to inform you two Americans were killed. They were criminals,” Putin reportedly told Trump.
“Well, President Putin, I think you know what you’re doing, and frankly, I think you have the right idea. What’s going on with these labs is a huge disgrace and catastrophe,” Trump replied.
In closing, Putin told President Trump “The war is almost over,” but did not elucidate on how long ‘almost’ would be."

The argument was that it was unfair that atheists had no such recognized days. The case was brought before a judge.  After listening to the passionate presentation by the lawyer, the judge banged his gavel declaring, ""Case dismissed!""

The Jews have Passover, Yom Kippur and Hanukkah, yet my client and all other atheists have no such holidays...""    
The judge leaned forward in his chair saying, ""But you do. Your client, counselor, is woefully ignorant."" 
The lawyer said,"" Your Honor, we are unaware of any special observance or holiday for atheists.""
The judge said, ""Psalm 14:1 states, 'The fool says in his heart, there is no God.'  The calendar says April 1st is April Fool’s Day.   Thus, it is the opinion of this court, that, if your client says there is no God, then he is a fool. Therefore, April 1st is his day.   Court is adjourned."""

Edited to add: as of right now, Wednesday at 12:45cst, I have no litter box proof. Only rumor. The rest I have verified. Although I’m not certain yet how widespread this is. It seems that there may be some kids who want to dress in their “costumes” and want others to just act like they’re not in costume and act as though it’s normal. Other kids are acting like it’s weird. Apparently, barking and hissing from both directions. And schools are caught in some weird space because there’s bullying going on. And also apparently some dress code double standards, for lack of a better way to put it. Ears and tails are okay. Baseballl caps are not. 
The weird part to me now is that a lot of this (probably not all) derives from sexual fetishes surrounding cosplay. So whether or not kids and parents  are aware of this aspect is worth something.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_220804,"US Special Forces on Saturday scored a major victory in the war against the Deep State–the arrest of Deep State mastermind and plandemic architect Dr. Anthony Fauci, a JAG source told Real Raw News.
The “White Hat” partition of the US military, he said, had for “a very long time” attempted to shadow Fauci but often lost his scent because the Deep State doctor used every trick in the book to delay his inevitable capture. When in public, Fauci was well-protected and often surrounded by at least a dozen armed guards and civilians who would have been caught in the crossfire had the military grabbed him in the open. And when travelling to and from events, Fauci used decoy vehicles to reduce risk of being captured. The decoy vehicles, our source said, often held Fauci lookalikes or even mannequins that someone had built and painted to resemble him.
On Saturday afternoon, however, the military caught a break.
“We got very good intel that Fauci on Saturday had minimum protection—two guards—and was leaving his D.C. house for a visit with his wife, who he hadn’t seen in months. The Deep State kept them separated because they thought we’d target her to get to Fauci. We’ve known all along where they hid her, and we were hoping for just such a stroke of luck,” our source said.
Fauci’s wife, Christine Grady, had been staying at the Ivy Hotel in Baltimore, Maryland, under an assumed name.
Special Forces in civilian vehicles discretely tailed Fauci’s car to an underground parking garage near the hotel and made their move. They boxed him in, drew weapons, and ordered Fauci’s guards to toss their firearms out the window.
“Fauci’s security complied, and Special Forces dragged Fauci from the vehicle, subdued him, and carted him off for processing.”
Incidentally, the arrest took place shortly after Bloomberg TV aired a taped interview with Fauci. During the interview, Fauci predicted a Covid resurgence and told host David Westin that the US would likely have to reimpose mask mandates and programs to encourage citizens to get more frequent booster shots.
Our source jokingly said JAG has evidence proving Fauci’s a prophet.
“Fauci seems to have an uncanny ability to look into the future. He has prerecorded literally thousands of videos about Covid that foresee what’ll happen one, three, and five years from now. In one video, he’s sitting at a desk in front of an electronic clock and calendar, and the date reads August 4, 2023, and Fauci’s going on and on about a new Covid variant that’s swept the country and pleading with citizens to obey new stay-at-home mandates. The breadth of these, I’m sure, will be shown at his military tribunal. The charges against him are astronomical,” our source said.
Those charges include treason, mass medical malpractice, and seditious conspiracy, and criminal homicide, according to a military arrest warrant."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_886963,"White Hats on Tuesday arrested the criminal Biden regime’s secretary of agriculture, Thomas J. Vilsack, after connecting him to the calculated destruction of a dozen agricultural processing facilities across the United States, JAG sources told Real Raw News
Back on March 24, marionette Joseph R. Biden made a shocking statement on national news. Muttered he, “With regard to food shortage, yes we did talk about food shortages, and it’s gonna be real,” in response to concerns about empty grocery store shelves and rising inflation. He pinned the blame on the usual suspect, Vladimir Putin, but also may have inadvertently telegraphed his administration’s goals of bankrupting and starving the American populace.
Within hours of Biden’s clairvoyant proclamation, a series of inexplicable ‘accidents’ began plaguing food processing plants throughout the country.
On March 24, a potato factory in Belfast, Maine, burned to the ground. Although officials said the fire was started by a large fryolator machine, line workers at Penobscot McCrum said the enormous vat fryers were disabled for routine maintenance when the blaze began.
On March 25, a mysterious fire razed the Maricopa Food Pantry in Maricopa County, Arizona, taking with it 50,000 pounds of staples. As of this writing, the Maricopa County Fire Department has yet to determine what caused the fire.
On March 31, a massive structural fire consumed the largest fresh onion packing facility in South Texas. A family-run business, Rio Fresh Inc. supplied fresh produce to grocery stores like Kroger’s, Aldi, Tom Thumb, and H-E-B. The conflagration put 300 people out of work and destroyed an estimated 100 truckloads of onions.
On April 12, a raging inferno engulfed the East Conway Beef & Pork plant in New Hampshire. According to owner Darrell Robinson, the fire, which is still under investigation, “destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of beef and pork and killed livestock.”
The above examples are emblematic of an issue that transcends mere conspiracy theory; the callous, gradual annihilation of America’s food chain. Since March 24, astute observers have catalogued 15 such incidents, none of which were covered by the MSM.
The U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps took interest in the bizarre fires only after being contacted by an FBI whistleblower on April 21, the same day a light commuter plane, a Cessna A340, nosedived into a General Mills plant in Covington, Georgia, killing the alleged occupants, a student-pilot and his CFI. Although the National Transportation Safety Board said the owner of the plane was doing flight training when the plane took a nosedive, the whistleblower claimed the FBI, not the NTSB, authored the accident report after usurping investigative authority from the NTSB’s regional go-team. This transfer of power should occur only if the NTSB suspects a crime and requests FBI aid. But in this case, the NTSB did not suspect a crime, did not request FBI help, and was shut out of the investigation within an hour of the crash. Typically, a thorough accident report takes weeks or months to compile, but the FBI had the answers at its fingertips in mere hours.
Furthermore, the whistleblower claimed that the FBI had “speciously falsified” the accident report, and in doing so removed a crucial “Smoking Gun” fact that shreds to pieces the official account. The plane had no occupants. It was remote controlled.
Additionally, the informant said he knew who had orchestrated the crash, as well as the previously mentioned food factory fires. He named Secretary of Agriculture Thomas J. Vilsack and had paperwork to support his claim.
“We’re hesitant to believe anything coming out of the FBI, even from a so-called whistleblower. White Hats don’t trust the Justice Department; they’re Deep State. They are masters of deception and disinformation. So, our investigators independently verify everything, and I mean everything. I can’t discuss specifics on the plane, but we confirmed it was pilotless when it hit the General Mills facility. This gave us reason to authenticate some of Vilsack’s email correspondence given to us by the informant,” a JAG source told Real Raw News.
An email sent from Vilsack to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, dated 13 April 2022, read, “Small, isolated events won’t get coverage but will have an immense impact on inflation. People shouldn’t bitch about paying higher prices, they have too much food as is. A little combustion isn’t a bad thing.” Two days later, Vilsack sent her a second email: “How does the saying go? When he says jump, we ask, ‘how high.’ Aviation accidents happen all the time, doesn’t have to be 767s or 757s.” A third email, written on 16 April, said, “The best way to conceal a crime is to hide it amid other seemingly unrelated crimes.”
JAG’s associates at U.S. Army Cyber Command, Fort Gordon, confirmed the emails had been sent from Vilsack’s government email account.
“Under authority of the Insurrection Act of 1807, it was felt this was enough evidence to pick him up on charges of treason. JAG drafted a military arrest warrant in his name.”
Vilsack, the former Governor of Iowa and, prior to that, the longest serving member of Hussein Obama’s original cabinet, was on April 26 taken into custody by JAG investigators at his home in Mount Pleasant, Iowa.
“He will be processed and made to answer before a military tribunal,” our source said."

How else can Governments around the world explain the fact the fully vaccinated are more likely to be infected with Covid-19, more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19, and more likely to die of Covid-19 than the unvaccinated?
How else can Governments around the world explain the huge rise in all-cause mortality rates among the fully vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated?
How else can Governments around the world explain the 1,145% to 33,715% increase in AIDS-related diseases, cancers and infections reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System in 2021?

Scotland
Public Health Scotland announced in January that from the 6th Feb 22, they would no longer report Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status on a weekly basis.
Here’s why –

The charts above have been created using the figures published by Public Health Scotland in their ‘COVID-19 & Winter Statistical Report‘ published 16th Feb 22, and they show that Covid-19 infection, hospitalisation and death rates per 100,000 individuals were consistently higher among the fully vaccinated population.
This is what Covid-19 vaccination has done to the people of Scotland.
New Zealand
The following chart shows the true number of Covid-19 cases by vaccination status between 6th Jan and 11th Feb, and between 12th Feb and 24th Feb in New Zealand. The data has been extracted from the following official New Zealand Ministry of Health ‘Covid-19: Case Demographics’ reports –
‘Covid-19: Case Demographics‘ report published 25th Feb 2022,
‘Covid-19: Case Demographics‘ report published 12th Feb 2022,
‘Covid-19: Case Demographics‘ report published 6th Jan 2022.

As you can see in both periods the fully vaccinated population accounted for the majority of Covid-19 cases, but the difference in the number of cases by vaccination status between 12th Feb and 24th Feb is shocking.
The following chart shows the Covid-19 case rate per 100k population by vaccination status between 6th Jan and 11th Feb, and between 12th Feb and 24th Feb 22 in New Zealand base on the cases above –

These case rates, just like the Public Health Scotland case rates, certainly pour water on the bonfire of anyone who says “vaccination reduces the chances of being infected with Covid-19”, don’t they?
This means the Covid-19 injections have a real-world negative effectiveness, and we’re able to use Pfizer’s vaccine effectiveness formula to calculate it.
Unvaccinated case rate – Vaccinated case rate / Unvaccinated case rate = Vaccine Effectiveness
The following chart shows the real-world two-dose Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness between 6th Jan and 11th Feb, and between 12th Feb and 24th Feb 22 –

Between 6th Jan and 11th Feb the real-world Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness proved to be minus-94.4%, but by the 24th Feb, the real-world vaccine effectiveness fell to minus-281.35%. This means the fully vaccinated were 3.8 times more likely to be infected with Covid-19 than the unvaccinated/one dose vaccinated population.
This is what double vaccination has done to the people of New Zealand.
Canada
Despite the Government enforcing Draconian restrictions which have in turn coerced millions into getting the Covid-19 injections, since the turn of the year the country of Canada has experienced its largest wave of Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths to date.
Why?
Official Government of Canada data shows that the vaccinated population as a whole has accounted for 4 in every 5 Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths from 21st February 2022, up to 17th April.
But it also shows the case/hospitalisation/death-rates per 100,000 population have been highest among the triple vaccinated during the same time frame.
So high that the data shows the triple vaccinated are on average 4 times more likely to be infected with Covid-19, 2 times more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19, and 3 times more likely to die of Covid-19 than the unvaccinated.
The following chart shows the vaccinated case-rates per 100,000 by vaccination status across Canada between 21st Feb and 17th April 2022 –

The following chart shows the vaccinated hospitalisation-rates per 100,000 by vaccination status across Canada between 21st Feb and 17th April 2022 –

The following chart shows the vaccinated death-rates per 100,000 by vaccination status across Canada between 21st Feb and 17th April 2022 –

This is what Covid-19 vaccination has done to the people of Canada.
England
The UK Health Security Agency is also playing the same game as Public Health Scotland, and since the 1st April 2022 has refused to publish any further data on Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status.
Here’s why –

The above three charts have been created using the figures contained in the Week 5, Week 9 and Week 13 UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) ‘Vaccine Surveillance’ reports.
The figures show that the case rates between week 5 and week 13 of 2022 were highest among the triple vaccinated in all age groups in England. Not just by a little bit either, and the gap between the unvaccinated and triple vaccinated has been getting worse by the month.
All age groups also suffered a higher Covid-19 death rate per 100,000 among the double vaccinated except for 18-29-year olds between week 5 and week 9.
But this age group only suffered a higher death rate among the unvaccinated in week 5, with week 9 and week 13 seeing an identical death rate among the unvaccinated and double-vaccinated.
The only other age group to break the trend was 30-39-year-olds, who flip-flopped back to a slightly higher death rate among the unvaccinated in week 13. But apart from this, all other age groups had suffered a higher death rate among the double vaccinated since the beginning of the year.
These aren’t the kind of figures we should be seeing if a vaccine is effective. These aren’t even the kind of figures we should be seeing if a vaccine is ineffective. What we’re seeing here is a vaccine that is having the opposite of its intended effect.
The following two charts shows the real-world Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness against death among the double vaccinated population in England by age group and week, based on the death rates provided above –
(Pfizer’s vaccine formula:
Unvaccinated Rate per 100k – Vaccinated Rate per 100k / Unvaccinated Rate per 100k x 100 = Vaccine Effectiveness)

A vaccine effectiveness against death of minus-111% was recorded among 60-69-year-olds, minus-138% among 70-79-year-olds, and minus-166% among people over the age of 80 in week 9 of 2022.
But just look at the figures for the 40-49-year-olds. In week 5 a vaccine effectiveness against death of +16% was recorded. Then in week 9 this fell to minus-32%. But then in week 13 this fell to a shocking minus-121%.
These figures show that most double vaccinated individuals are twice as likely to die of Covid-19 than unvaccinated individuals.
The following chart shows the real-world Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population by age-group and week in England between 3rd January and 27th March 2022, based on the case-rate figures provided previously above –

This is nowhere near the claimed 95% effectiveness by Pfizer, is it? Vaccine effectiveness was as low as minus-391.43% among 60-69-year-olds in Week 13, falling from minus 114.8% in week 5.
The most concerning declines here seem to be among the 60-69-year-olds and 70-79-year-olds because it looks like they have fallen off a cliff between week 9 and week 13. Thankfully the fall among 18-29-year-olds seems to have slowed between week 9 and week 13 but still sits at minus-231.22% after being minus-29.8% in week 5.
These figures show that 60-69-year-olds are nearly 5 times more likely to be infected with Covid-19 than unvaccinated 60-69-year-olds, and show that 40-59 and 70-79-year-olds are over 4 times more likely to be infected with Covid-19 than their unvaccinated counterparts.
The UKHSA claims that vaccine effectiveness wanes substantially over time and this is why it’s important to get a booster dose. But this is a lie. Vaccine effectiveness doesn’t wane. Immune system performance does.
Vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipient’s immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.
A vaccine effectiveness of -50% would mean that the immune system of the vaccinated is now performing at a worse rate than the natural immune system of the unvaccinated. It would mean the Covid-19 vaccines have damaged the immune system, and that’s precisely what these figures are showing.
The following chart shows the immune system performance of the triple vaccinated population in England by age group in per week compared to the natural immune system of the unvaccinated population based on the case-rate figures provided above –
Positive Immune System Performance = Unvaccinated Case Rate – Vaccinated Case Rate / Unvaccinated Case Rate x 100
Negative Immune System Performance = Unvaccinated Case Rate – Vaccinated Case Rate / Vaccinated Case Rate x 100

The lowest immune system performance was among 60-69-year-olds at a shocking minus-80%, but all triple vaccinated people aged 30 to 59 were not far behind, with an immune system performance ranging from minus-75% to minus-76%.
Even the 18 to 29-year-olds were within this region at minus-70%, falling from an immune system performance of +11.35% between week 51 and week 2, meaning they suffered the fastest decline in immune system performance.
Anyone over the age of 60 who has had three jabs should be extremely concerned based on the figures above because they reveal an extremely rapid decline in immune system performance since the beginning of 2022.
But that’s not to say anyone under the age of 60 shouldn’t be concerned, they are already all suffering from an immune system that has degraded on average between 70 and 76%.
This is what Covid-19 Vaccination has done to the people of England… and Scotland, and New Zealand, and Canada, and most likely the rest of the world.
The question is, why?
Antibody-Dependent Enhancement?
Intensive research conducted by health experts throughout the years has brought to light increasing concerns about “Antibody-Dependent Enhancement” (ADE), a phenomenon where vaccines make the disease far worse by priming the immune system for a potentially deadly overreaction.
ADE can arise in several different ways but the best-known is dubbed the ‘Trojan Horse Pathway’. This occurs when non-neutralizing antibodies generated by past infection or vaccination fail to shut down the pathogen upon re-exposure.
Instead, they act as a gateway by allowing the virus to gain entry and replicate in cells that are usually off limits (typically immune cells, like macrophages). That, in turn, can lead to wider dissemination of illness, and over-reactive immune responses that cause more severe illness.
In previous clinical trials of vaccine candidates to combat SARS and MERS, the studies each failed during the animal phase due to ADE also known as pathogenic priming or a cytokine storm.
Phase three clinical trials are designed to uncover frequent or severe side effects before a vaccine is approved for use, including ADE.
But herein lies the problem, none of the Covid-19 vaccines have completed phase three clinical trials.
The Pfizer phase three trial is not due to complete until February 8th 2024, after previously being estimated to complete in April 2023.

However, of the information collated by Pfizer so far in the ongoing study they have conducted, it is clear to see that they were fully aware in February 2021 that antibody-dependent enhancement was a possible consequence of their Covid-19 injection, and it appears they also knew by April 2021 that the phenomenon was killing people.

Vaccine-associated enhanced diseases (VAED) are modified presentations of clinical infections affecting individuals exposed to a wild-type pathogen after having received a prior vaccination for the same pathogen. Enhanced responses are triggered by failed attempts to control the infecting virus, and VAED typically presents with symptoms related to the target organ of the infection pathogen.
According to scientists, VAED occurs as two different immunopathologies, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and vaccine-associated hypersensitivity (VAH).
Antibody-Dependent Enhancement would certainly explain why the vaccinated population are twice as likely to be hospitalised with and die of Covid-19 than the unvaccinated population, but we’re not sure it would explain why the vaccinated are up to five times more likely to be infected with Covid-19.
Another extremely serious condition that would explain the higher case rate as well as the higher hospitalisation/death rate is Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome?
It’s a common misconception that Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is only caused by the HIV virus. This simply isn’t true.
Acquired (or secondary) immunodeficiency is one of the major causes of infections in adults. These immunodeficiency disorders affect your immune system partially or as a whole, making your body an easy target for several diseases and infections. (Source)
When immunodeficiency disorders affect your immune system, your body can no longer fight bacteria and diseases. (Source)
Several factors in the environment can cause secondary immunodeficiency disorders. ‌(Source)
Some common ones are:
Radiation or chemotherapy, which can lead to a secondary immunodeficiency disorder known as neutropenia
Infections due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can result in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
Leukaemia, a cancer that begins in the cells of the bone marrow that can lead to hypogammaglobulinemia—a type of secondary immunodeficiency
Malnutrition, which affects up to 50% of populations in underdeveloped countries and leaves people vulnerable to respiratory infections and diarrhoea
But some of the less common causes include Drugs or medications. (Source)
So it’s perfectly possible for a medication or drug to cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and data published by Public Health Scotland, the New Zealand Ministry of Health, the Government of Canada, the UK Health Security Agency, the UK’s Office for National Statistics, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control strongly suggests the Covid-19 injections should be added to the list.
USA
The CDC hosts a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System where adverse reactions to vaccines can be reported. The full database can be found here.
The database contains adverse reactions reported to all available vaccines in the USA, stretching as far back as 1950. So, we ran a search of the database to check for common diseases and infections associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and this is what we found.
The following chart shows the percentage of AIDS-associated adverse reactions reported to VAERS to all vaccines by year –

The data shows that fifty-one-percent of all adverse reactions associated with AIDS reported since the year 2000 were reported in 2021, and a further 16% have been reported in 2022 so far.
The following chart shows the number of common cancers usually associated with AIDS that have been reported to VAERS as adverse reactions to all vaccines (including the Covid-19 jabs) by the year reported, and the Covid-19 vaccines only by the year reported –

As you can see there was a huge increase in reports in 2021 and in 2022 so far, with the vast majority being attributed to the Covid-19 injections.
The average number of common cancers associated with AIDS being reported as adverse reactions to any vaccine between the years 2000 and 2020 equates to 21.3.
The total number of common cancers associated with AIDS reported as adverse reactions in 2021 was 430. This represents a 1919% increase.
It is however important to note that not all adverse reactions are reported to VAERS. In fact the CDC has admitted just 1 to 10% of adverse reactions are actually reported to the system. But a brilliant analysis conducted by Jessica Rose Phd accurately estimates the underreporting factor to be at least 41.3. See here.
The following chart shows the number of acquired immune disorders, including AIDS, that have been reported to VAERS as adverse reactions to all vaccines (including the Covid-19 jabs) by the year reported, and the Covid-19 vaccines only by the year reported –

Yet again there was a huge increase in reports in 2021 and in 2022 so far, with the vast majority being attributed to the Covid-19 injections.
The average number of acquired immune disorders being reported as adverse reactions to any vaccine between the years 2000 and 2020 equates to 31.
The total number of acquired immune disorders reported as adverse reactions in 2021 was 386. This represents a 1145% increase.
The following chart shows the number of sepsis cases that have been reported to VAERS as adverse reactions to all vaccines (including the Covid-19 jabs) by the year reported, and the Covid-19 vaccines only by the year reported –

Sepsis is the body’s extreme response to an infection. It is a life-threatening medical emergency. Sepsis happens when an infection you already have triggers a chain reaction throughout your body. Infections that lead to sepsis most often start in the lung, urinary tract, skin, or gastrointestinal tract.
The average number of sepsis cases being reported as adverse reactions to any vaccine between the years 2000 and 2020 equates to 75.
The total number of sepsis cases reported as adverse reactions in 2021 was 1593. This represents a 2024% increase.
Are we really to believe that this is just an unfortunate coincidence? Or are we witnessing the American public report to the Centres for Disease control that the Covid-19 injections are causing them to develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome?
Damning Figures from the Office for National Statitics
The Office for National Statistics is the UK’s largest independent producer of official statistics and the recognised national statistical institute of the UK. It is responsible for collecting and publishing statistics related to the economy, population and society at national, regional and local levels.
In its latest dataset on deaths in England by vaccination status, which can be found here, the ONS reveals that the all-cause mortality-rate among the fully vaccinated is higher than the all-cause mortality rate among the unvaccinated.
So not only are the vaccinated population more likely to die of Covid-19, they are more likely to die of any cause. This further supports the available evidence that suggests the Covid-19 injections are doing untold damage to the immune system, causing people to develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
Table 2 of the ONS dataset contains data on the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status by age group for all deaths in England.
The following chart shows the monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status for all-cause deaths, per 100,000 person-years among adults aged 18 to 39 in England. The green line is the mortality rate among the unvaccinated, which while fluctuating has remained pretty stable throughout.

The other lines however represent different vaccination statuses, and they are extremely concerning. The orange, yellow, and pink lines represent mortality rates within 21 days of receiving a first, second or third dose. And they reveal that the risk of death increases significantly immediately after vaccination.
But the most concerning figures are the mortality rates among those vaccinated at least 21 days ago, which you can see more clearly in the following chart –

In January 2021 the mortality rate per 100,000 person-years among the unvaccinated equated to 67.7. This then fell month on month to 33.1 in May, before increasing again in June to 44.8. The same however cannot be said for those who had received a single dose at least 21 days prior to their death.
In January 2021 the mortality rate per 100,000 person-years among the partly vaccinated equated to 119.9. Meaning the mortality rate was 77% higher than the mortality rate among the unvaccinated. This then fell to 68.3 deaths per 100,000 in February, before climbing to 90.1 in March, then 108.8 in April.
This means at this point the mortality rate among the partly vaccinated was 193.3% higher than the mortality rate among the unvaccinated. But not long after following the second dose being administered things get even worse.
The highest mortality rate among the double vaccinated (at least 21 days ago) occurred in September 2021, with 125.9 deaths per 100,000 person-years. In the same month, the mortality rate among the unvaccinated equated to 46.8. Meaning the double vaccinated mortality rate was 169% higher than the unvaccinated mortality rate.
But the largest statistical difference occurred in November 2021. The mortality rate among the unvaccinated equated to 33.4 deaths per 100,000 person-years, whereas the mortality rate among the double vaccinated equated to 107. A difference of 220.4%.
The following chart shows the average-age standardised mortality rate to have occurred between 1st Jan 21 and 31st Jan 22 by vaccination status for all-cause deaths, per 100,000 person-years among adults aged 18 to 39 in England –

The average mortality rate throughout these 13 months among the unvaccinated equates to 43.9 deaths per 100,000 person-years. But ignoring the mortality rate within the first 21 days of vaccination, we find that this is actually the lowest mortality rate among all vaccination statuses, and these include Covid-19 deaths in the rates.
The average partly vaccinated (At least 21 days ago) mortality rate equates to 66.3 deaths per 100,000. Whilst the average double vaccinated (At least 21 days ago) mortality rate equates to 84.02 deaths per 100,000 person-years between 1st Jan 21 and 31st Jan 22.
On average the one-dose vaccinated were 51% more likely to die than the unvaccinated, and the double vaccinated were 91.4% more likely to die than the unvaccinated between 1st Jan 21 and 31st Jan 22.
Something is very wrong, and it is because of the Covid-19 Injections
The real-world data does not lie.
The Covid-19 injection makes recipients more likely to be infected with Covid-19, more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19, and more likely to die of Covid-19. But it turns out they also make recipients more likely to die of any cause.
Couple this with the fact that VAERS reports of diseases, cancers and infections associated with AIDS increased between 1145% and 33,715% in 2021 following the introduction of the Covid-19 injections, then surely it’s time for the Governments of Scotland, New Zealand, Canada, the UK, the USA, and the rest of the world to admit that the Covid-19 injections are causing recipients to develop a new form of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome?"

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_711841,"Let’s begin with a basic truth that most of the corporate media continually ignore or obscure: President Trump’s endorsement is the single most powerful force in the universe of American politics. There’s never been anything quite like it. Trump-endorsed candidates overwhelmingly prevailed in the latest GOP primaries by a margin of 24-4. In fact, President Trump is running the table on the GOP establishment in the 2022 races. His record stands at 92-7 at the moment.

Trump’s endorsement basically won the race for JD Vance in Ohio, and for Ted Budd in North Carolina. In Pennsylvania, his endorsement did the same thing for Doug Mastriano in the governor’s race. This has happened again and again in 2022. Remember, Trump’s record is 92-7.

That’s what makes the primary results in Georgia last night so curious and so suspect.

Georgia is the only state where President Trump’s endorsements did not count.


(Photo: VP Pence rallies for Brian Kemp and only 100 people show up — but Kemp wins the race with 72% of the vote?)

President Trump had endorsed quite a few candidates in Georgia, including David Perdue in the gubernatorial race with Brian Kemp, and Jody Hice in the race for Secretary of State against Brad Raffensperger. His endorsements were decisive in almost every political race in America this year. So why was Georgia such an outlier?

Sure, Georgia is an open primary state — Democrats are allowed to vote in the GOP primaries there — but that’s not the real story. Look at the RCP polling average: Brian Kemp was getting 52% of the votes and his main challenger, David Perdue, was getting 38% of the votes just before the race.

On Primary Day in Georgia, Kemp gets 74% and Perdue gets 22%. Nobody in any election in America gets 74% of the votes. Ever. It doesn’t happen.

Obvious fraud.


Brian Kemp’s funny numbers are not the only funny numbers in the Georgia primaries either. In the race for insurance commissioner, Trump-endorsed candidate Patrick Witt lost to a nobody named John King — and John King got 70% of the votes!

Now take a look at Patrick Witt’s numbers county by county: he got the same percentage of votes in 122 out of 159 counties in Georgia.

Let me repeat: the same percentage. Patrick Witt gets the same percentage in deep blue counties as he gets in deep red counties. Uniform numbers.

A month ago, the University of Georgia conducted a poll of Georgia’s Republican voters found very different results that directly contradict these funny numbers. In fact, the University of Georgia was predicting that Trump-endorsed candidates were going to win almost everything — which is happening in every other state in the country right now.

Allow me to quote at length:

So, to summarize, Trump’s endorsement is so powerful that Patrick Witt gets 52% of the vote, Jody Hice gets 60% of the vote, and Burt Jones gets 59% in a poll one month before the races.

On Primary Day in Georgia, none of this happened.

In fact, the candidates that were not endorsed by Trump went from single digits in the poll to commanding wins rarely seen in American politics. John King (who won with 70% remember!) was getting only 7% of the poll vote. Brad Raffensperger (who won!) got only 16% of the poll vote. Butch Miller (who might still win in a recount!) got only 8% of the poll vote.

Ask yourself: is that possible?

No, it’s not.

Meanwhile, the election integrity organization VOTER GA held a press conference on Monday to announce that 102 Georgia counties could not produce their drop box surveillance videos for the stolen 2020 election.

Let me repeat that number: 102 Georgia counties.

Apparently, 72 counties were forced to admit that all those videos had been destroyed.

Read the full press release for yourself.

Something stinks in Georgia.

The numbers are funny because many of these races were rigged.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_756059,"Former First Lady Michelle Obama was registered to vote as a man from 1994 until 2008, according to official documents obtained from the Illinois State Board of Elections. The official documents also reveal Obama officially changed her Sex to female in 2008, the same year her husband was running for the presidency.

The official documents were obtained from the state of Illinois by documentary filmmaker Joel Gilbert who explains that he decided to “take a serious approach” to learning about Michelle Obama’s background because the mainstream media refuses to touch the topic.

But he didn’t expect to find proof that she registered to vote as a man for fourteen years

Gilbert was stunned when he received Michelle Obama’s official voter registration cards from 1994 and 2008. Describing the process of unraveling Michelle Obama’s “changing sexual identity,” Gilbert writes:

“Having recently obtained official documents from the state of Illinois, here is what I can say with assurance: I found proof in official documents that Michelle Obama registered to vote as a man in 1994. I also have official proof that, after 14 years of voting as a man, Michelle Obama changed her sex in 2008 from male to female. This is not more social media silliness, this is fact. I obtained the documents from the Illinois State Board of Elections only last week. Here is Michelle Obama’s official voter registration card from 1994 when she registered to vote as a man. The letter M is circled under Sex.“

“Then, on July 14, 2008, with her husband about to be nominated by the Democrats for the presidency, she changed her sex from male to female.“

Remarkable timing, I’m sure you will agree.

And before you accuse Joel Gilbert of conspiring to frame Michelle Obama and falsely smear her as transgender, there is one fact you should keep in mind. Despite discovering that Michelle Obama registered to vote as a man in 1994, Gilbert still doesn’t believe she was born male. He charitably believes she must have “ticked the wrong box” and accidentally registered to vote as a male. He explains:

“Her voter registration as a male was likely a clerical error of some sort made when Michelle completed her 1994 voter registration form. She must have only noticed it in 2008 and corrected it appropriately.”

Wow. Some people really want to believe what they are told.

Since the early days of the Obama administration, citizens across the board have studied videos and photos of Michelle Obama and said that she is a man.

In 2014, comedienne Joan Rivers fueled both rumors in responding to a TMZ reporter who innocently asked her whether the U.S. would ever elect a gay president.

“We already have it with Obama, so let’s just calm down,” said Rivers, before adding, “You know Michelle is a tranny.” When asked to clarify her remark, she articulated slowly, “A trans-gen-der. We all know.”

Rivers’ comments fuelled social media postings of photos suggesting Michelle is really a man, and close-up slow-motion videos of her dancing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show purporting to show something lurking in her pants.

Less than two months later, Rivers died as a result of what was supposed to be a minor throat procedure. Needless to say, her unexpected death cranked up the rumor mill, and even Barack Obama’s own family fueled the rumor. On Twitter, Barack’s older brother Malik hinted that he knows the truth.

Before he suddenly clammed up, deleted the original tweet, and refused to confirm or deny the allegations about “BIG MIKE.”

Remarkably, Barack Obama himself has slipped up and called her “Michael”… over and over again.

Hmm… Have you ever met a man who accidentally calls his wife by a man’s name?

Stealth is at the heart of the Obamas’ long-term strategy since day one. Barack and his co-conspirators have been grooming Michelle to run for president since 2016. As a first step, the power couple signed a $65 million offer to write their respective memoirs as soon as they left the White House.

Another tell-tale clue of the Democrats’ plans for Michelle came when they awarded her the coveted keynote speaker role at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. In the way of parallel, Barack was the keynote convention speaker in 2004, four years before he was named as the candidate in 2008.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_834190,"Delta Force Operators Monday morning intercepted an 18-wheeler packed with pistols and bound for the Internal Revenue Service Building in Washington, D.C., a source in General David H. Berger’s office told Real Raw News.

Hours after Kabula Harris’s tie-breaking vote on the regime’s climate, health, and tax bill empowered the IRS to hire and arm 87,000 new agents—to the tune of $80bn—an inconspicuous tractor trailer departed a government-leased warehouse in Jessup, Maryland. The obsidian cab and attached trailer swerved through the city’s industrial district and was preparing to veer onto the Baltimore-Washington Parkway when it met an obstacle: four SUVs, each as black as the trailer, blocked its path, two on the road and one on each shoulder. Under ordinary circumstances, the trailer could’ve steamrolled the blockade. But these were not ordinary circumstances. Behind each SUV stood four men garbed in military attire, every one of them brandishing rifles aimed at the cab’s windshield.

As the truck screeched to a halt, four of the 16 Delta Force Operators approached and commanded the driver and passenger to show their hands and exit the vehicle. They complied and were gagged and zip tied, then pushed into the lead SUV. Wordlessly, two Operators climbed aboard the now seized cab and keyed the ignition. Within seconds, the vehicles had dispersed. The intercept and seizure had taken only minutes to complete.

The tractor trailer had left Maryland at 2:00 a.m. and, under current traffic conditions, been scheduled to arrive in D.C. no later than 4:00 a.m. By then, however, Special Forces had driven the trailer to safehouse/warehouse they had prepared in advance, and were already inventorying the load against a shipping manifest found in the cab.

According to the manifest, the trailer held 23,500 crated Sig Saur P229s and 160,000 rounds of .40 caliber ammunition, ostensibly intended for the IRS’s enhanced police force.

A week before the seizure, U.S. Army Cyber Command had intercepted communications between IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, Chuck Schumer, and Joe Manchin. Rettig had said on a conference call that “the purchase has been made,” which caused a somewhat agitated Schumer to inadvertently expose the nature of the shipment. “Why now? You were supposed to wait until we passed the bill and its made law. You jumped the gun, and mean that literally and figuratively, and this could come back at us,” Schumer said. Manchin bowed out of the conversation, saying, “I really don’t need to hear any of this,” and disconnected. But Schumer and Rettig bantered on. “We know the bill will pass muster, Kamala will see to it. It isn’t a problem. We’ll just say later on that we bought the guns after the bill got passed and ratified,” Rettig blabbered. “Don’t take possession until Biden makes it law,” Schumer said, to which Rettig blurted, “They can’t sit where they are that long, too risky. I’m moving them here from Maryland storage when it passes. If there’s any blowback, it’ll fall on me.”

U.S. Army Cyber Command at once forwarded a recording of the call to both Marine Corps General David H. Berger and a Delta Force commander whose name remains classified. Together, they greenlit a mission to confiscate the IRS’s would-be arsenal. Research revealed that the federal government had contracts with several shipping and warehouse facilities in the Maryland area, and Delta Force Operators soon began surveillance on those locations, hitting pay dirt rather quickly. The Jessup warehouse, they discovered, was guarded by a throng of treasury agents whose blue windbreakers with IRS Special Agent stenciled on the back conspicuously betrayed their identities.

Delta Force had a choice to make: raid the warehouse and risk a firefight, or continue surveillance until the warehouse’s contents had been loaded onto a trailer, and seize it enroute to its destination.

According to our source, Delta Force had watched treasury agents fill the trailer with rectangular wooden crates, the contents of which had been stamped in blank ink on the wood—pistols, lots of them, and ammo.

“Delta expected security would go with the truck, but it was only the driver and one IRS agent in the passenger seat. No tailing vehicles. The IRS is an enemy of the people, and those pistols…why would they need them? Think about that? This is victory but a small one because they have $80bn to play with. We’re still in the fight,” our source said in closing."

1. DO NOT put your ballot in the mail! It gives an opportunity for bad actors to know how may fraudulent ballots they need to produce (2000 Mules anyone?)🇺🇸

2. Turn your ballot in ON election day either at the Auditor's office or in an official drop box BEFORE the collection time. 🇺🇸

3. Check in on your ballot for 2 reasons (this can be done on your state's voting website).🇺🇸

- To make sure a fraudulent ballot wasn't accepted under your name before YOU vote on Election Day! 

- To ensure that your ballot is accepted! They reject ballots that aren't signed, or that have a signature that doesn't match the one they have on file, if there's a stray mark on your ballot or if it's not inside the little security envelope that nobody understands.

If your ballot is rejected, in most States, you have the right to contest that rejection in a timely manner. Contact you county auditor for information on what you need to do. Check often! 

In Washington, you can check at votewa.gov 🇺🇸

Yes, really.

According to a recent CNN column, dogs, cats and other domestic meat-eating pets are devastating the Earth’s climate.

In the last few years, the level of urgency to “save the planet” coming from the mainstream media and globalist elites has intensified to dizzying new heights. From the early warnings of “don’t shower every day,” to today’s open discussions about eugenics. Trying to deface iconic works of art is sadly just the start, they’re now trying to openly kill our pets and will eventually move onto humans too.
Wnd.com reports: Scientists — who write the papers funded by eco-idealogues with findings developed so that they can write the next paper funded by eco-idealogues — use any means necessary to scare people. Decades of the sky not falling means only a minute fraction of the public believes the hype, and therefore support extreme positions regarding population control and now, even animal control.
A few years ago, cow flatulence was going to keep the world from achieving its climate goals, so Bessie was targeted for her carbon hoofprint.
That was child’s play compared to the CNN column, recapping a study that immediate action was necessary to stop the pending climate catastrophe. Their solutions? Don’t bring large-breed animals into your home, and no matter the size, feed Fido or Fluffy only insect-based meals.
According to the CNN column, “Their [pets’] meat-heavy diet is the biggest contributor to their carbon pawprints, which requires an abundance of energy, land and water to produce. And the production of pet food emits huge amounts of planet-warming gases … if our furry friends formed a separate country, it would rank 5th in global meat consumption behind China, the US, Brazil and Russia.”
As a pet owner, the thought of sacrificing any of my six dogs — three small-breed and three whose size exceeds 45 pounds apiece — is both laughable and irritating. My girls’ care, feeding, health and exercise is top-notch, and their importance to my family is beyond anything the world would achieve by eliminating the larger three, or replacing the occasional beef or chicken-based treats with a grub, grasshopper or glowworm.
According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, the U.S. has 80 million families owning over 135 million dogs and cats between them. Animals’ unconditional love to those families is immeasurable, and the lessons children learn while taking care of pets provide a foundation for those who become parents to children later in life.
Larger-breed dogs provide emotional support, protect other animals, and are used for transportation and for extending commerce in my home state of Alaska, including the iconic Iditarod sled-dog race each March.
America should reject the anti-dog agenda of the extreme eco-movement. After all, large-breed dogs need love, too."

JAG sources told Real Raw News Saturday morning that Pelosi has been charged with multiple counts of treason and seditious conspiracy—coincidentally, perhaps, the very same charges she told the Department of Justice to level against Oath Keeper Stewart Rhodes. A federal jury on Friday convicted Rhodes of seditious conspiracy for plotting to overturn the 2020 election and inciting violence at the Capitol on Jan 6.
“JAG’s charges against Pelosi are concrete, and irrespective of the regime’s unlawful prosecution of innocent people that visited the Capitol. There was no insurrection, no attempted coup. The DOJ is targeting people for supporting Trump. We’re after legitimate criminals—like Pelosi,” our source said.
He added that Nancy Pelosi was flown to Guantanamo Bay hours after Special Forces apprehended her near Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Pelosi, he said, offered no resistance because she was “sloshed and reeked of booze” when Special Forces pulled her from the passenger seat of a Mercedes AMG SL 63. She expressed concern about the condition of her car, and indifference for the state of her driver, who, Real Raw News can now report, died on impact when his head smashed the windshield. Pelosi’s airbag deployed; the driver’s had not.
“I just bought it,” Pelosi had told Special Forces. “Take care of it for me.”
Before hauling her to GITMO, Special Forces drove Pelosi to a “safehouse” to sober up. Her BAC was 0.47%, a potentially life-threatening condition with risk of coma or respiratory arrest. After a while, a somewhat sober Pelosi was shown a military arrest warrant in her name—signed by both President Donald J. Trump and Vice Adm. Darse E. Crandall—and told she would be taken to GITMO to face a military tribunal.
A tribunal date will likely be determined early next week, sources said."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_965673,"Russian Special Forces on Tuesday raided and destroyed an “Adrenochrome farm” near the Ukrainian city of Shostka, where sinister forces tortured abducted Russian children to harvest fluid from their adrenal glands, said a Mar-a-Lago source who claims Russian President Vladimir Putin informed President Trump of the operation after Spetznas had rescued 50 young kids from the ghastly laboratory.
As reported early last year, Trump and Putin kept an open conduit of communication after the latter began his “special military operation” in Ukraine. Putin had assured Trump that his true impetus for deploying troops was to rid Eastern Europe of Western pestilence, meaning Deep State-controlled bioweapon facilities and child trafficking rings, both of which, Putin said at the time, threatened Russian sovereignty. As time passed, their conversations became less frequent, but Putin has periodically updated Trump on progress, our source said.
The maligned Russian president told Trump that the FSB, Russia’s Federal Security Service, had heard of the lab’s existence and whereabouts only a few days before he greenlit a mission to infiltrate the laboratory, collect evidence, save any children within, and utterly destroy the facility.
Fifty Children were in a medically induced coma when Spetznas breached the lab and shot dead eight “technicians” who had been milling about or inserting long needles into the kidney area of comatose children. Each child was fastened to a metal gurney.
Putin reportedly said he believed that the abductees were Russian children who had been kidnapped from cities and towns that straddle the Russia-Ukraine border. He also said two of the eight “technicians” were from the West—one an American immunologist with ties to the NIH; the other a Brit who had worked at the UK Health Security Agency. Medical paraphernalia—beakers, tubing, syringes, microscopes, centrifuges, autoclaves, etc.—had come from supply companies in the United States.
“Putin inferred a theory: that the Deep State, with Volodymyr Zelensky’s blessing, moved some or all its adrenochrome refinement to Ukraine, because they’re afraid to do it in the states cause the Constitutionalist faction of the U.S. military, or White Hats, are hunting them down. Then the refined product is shipped to the U.S. or picked up by Deep Staters visiting Ukraine,” our source said.
Putin, he added, told Trump the Deep State is irrepressible and, therefore, must be “crushed,” and boasted about “crushing” dozens of traitors within his own government. “Traitors sometimes have accidental fall out window,” he said.
He described the Deep State as a universal malevolent entity bent on enslaving the planet and subjugating humanity to its capricious whims.
“We’re fighting the same enemy,” Trump said to him. “But I need to be very careful what I say here, especially now. I’m glad you saved the defenseless children. Adrenochrome’s been a huge problem here for a very long time.”
Putin said his forces turned the Adrenochrome lab “to dust” and reassured Trump that any stories of him being gravely sick or dead were CIA propaganda.
“The evil ones that do this to our children, President Trump, they are vampires,” Putin said."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_860441,"Russian Special Forces in Ukraine have intercepted a refrigerated tractor-trailer that was hauling refined Adrenochrome from Ukraine to Warsaw, Poland, where the shipment would have been loaded onto planes headed for the United States, a Russian FSB agent, Andrei Zakharov, told Real Raw News.
As reported last month, the FSB claimed that “Deep State” Adrenochrome manufacturers in the United States became so fearful of military retaliation that they set up shop in Eastern European countries, especially Ukraine, sympathetic to the criminal Biden regime. In January, Spetznas rescued 50 imprisoned, emaciated children from an “Adrenochrome farm” near Shostka, Ukraine. Their captors had so frequently drained their brittle bodies of blood and adrenal fluid that their survival depended on being kept in a medically induced coma, fed intravenously. Zakharov said that five of the 50 have perished due to wounds sustained in captivity.
Under Putin’s orders, the FSB has since launched a widespread initiative to track and eliminate Adrenochrome manufacturers, sellers, buyers, middlemen, and anyone involved in the production and export of a pharmaceutical cocktail Putin has called “the devil’s work.” Zakharov said that the Russian president had formed an “Adrenochrome taskforce” comprised of special agents and handpicked Spetznas to tackle the growing crisis.
The task force scored a victory on Sunday, capturing an 18-wheeler filled with chilled Adrenochrome that could have reached the shores of the United States. The intercept reportedly took place along P94–a roadway stretching from southern Ukraine to Brest, a border city and checkpoint with points of egress leading to Warsaw, Poland—and included at least a dozen Spetznas and FSB operatives.
Zakharov wouldn’t say how they learned of the shipment or why the team seized the truck on the highway instead of at its departure point, but he did say a cargo manifest identified the truck’s contents as Penicillin and other injectable antibiotics. Ukraine’s principal exports are agricultural products, not medicine.
“If we are slaughtering Ukrainian citizens, as Zelenskyy says, why would he send medicine out of the country? It Makes no sense. The trailer had no medicine, only Adrenochrome poison,” Zakharov said.
Spetznas held the driver and a passenger at gunpoint while inspecting the truck. According to Zakharov, the task force has been trained to visually identify Adrenochrome without laboratory tests. Whether an infusion or an injection, the liquid is slightly viscous, scintillates when exposed to sunlight, and has an almost imperceptible red tint, Zakharov said.
The truck’s occupants, Ukrainian citizens, wouldn’t cooperate and were shot on the spot as war criminals, per Vladimir Putin’s standing orders.
“These filth deserve no mercy,” Zakharov said. “They are agents of evil.”
He added that the task force took samples for chemical analysis before torching the semi.
The manifest said the shipment was to be taken to Warsaw International Airport and loaded aboard an Atlas Air cargo plane bound for Dover AFB in Delaware.
Note: We have yet to confirm this story through domestic sources. In the past, Vladimir Putin has shared details on Adrenochrome interdictions with President Trump. We hope that our Mar-a-Lago sources hear of such a conversation, and if so, we’ll update this story as appropriate.
Correction: We intiially called Dover an airport. It is an AFB. We have corrected the article text."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_812727,"Russian Forces on Friday “decommissioned” an adrenochrome factory in western Ukraine, this time hammering it with cruise missiles launched from a frigate in the North Sea, Russian FSB agent Andrei Zakharov told Real Raw News.
News of the factory’s destruction comes weeks after Spetznas intercepted an adrenochrome-laden tractor-trailer headed for Poland.
Vladimir Putin, Zakharov said, has spared no expense investigating reports of scores of adrenochrome farms popping up across an embattled Ukraine and committed “many, many soldiers” to destroy a pharmaceutical cocktail Putin has called “the devil’s elixir.”
Last week, FSB learned that an industrial warehouse in the Ukrainian city of Khmelnytskiy was being retrofitted into what seemed like an adrenochrome harvesting facility. Satellite imagery showed the building being emptied of grain and filled with medical equipment used in the adrenochrome trade—hospital gurneys, centrifuges, medical freezers and refrigerators, anesthesia machines, sterilizers, lights, and electrosurgical units.
“These items can be in any hospital, but there is perfectly good hospital less than 1km away. And it’s empty hospital. Your Western media tells lies of Ukrainian victims filling hospitals. We saw this warehouse very suspicious,” Zakharov said.
Putin, however, was unwilling to obliterate the building without first putting boots on the ground to confirm that the warehouse would be used to siphon blood and adrenal fluid from kidnapped Russian children. Undercover FSB, Zakharov said, slipped undetected into western Ukraine and put eyes on the warehouse. They spent two days surveilling it and saw ‘smoking guns’ suggesting the warehouse was no ordinary wartime triage center. First, they spotted a man named Eldric Spitz, a biotechnologist attached to the German pharmaceutical company Fresenius Kabi, entering the warehouse at noon and leaving it at 2:00 a.m., an odd work hour. Spitz had been on Putin’s radar since last month, when Spetznas destroyed an adrenochrome harvesting center in Shostka, Ukraine. Spitz’s name appeared in documents found on a laptop Spetznas had seized before torching the facility.
Moreover, the FSB surveillance team noticed a truck dropping off boxes of stuffed animal toys at the warehouse.
“These filth kidnappers, they use toys to calm children into a false sense of security before draining them,” Zakharov said. “Our men used thermal optics to see heat signatures inside. Never more than four. This made Putin think children were not yet taken to it. President Putin courageously made a decision to destroy it before it was operational.”
On Friday, a Russian Navy frigate launched a salvo of Kalibr high-precision ship-based land-attack cruise missiles on the warehouse, which, Zakharov said, was laid waste until the only trace of its existence was a pile of smoldering rubble.
“We decommissioned it,” he said."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_389197,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the destruction of all Covid-19 vaccine stockpiles on Russian soil, citing an undeniable connection between what has been dubbed the “Moscow Vax” and a sudden surge of HIV infections in vaccinated persons, FSB agent Andrei Zakharov told Real Raw News.
Although Putin has not made a formal announcement, he has tasked his right-hand man, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, with purging hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies of the Sputnik and CoviVac vaccine variants. The military will ensure compliance by auditing vaccine repositories and performing spot inspections.
Like President Trump, Putin was deceived by a lie; a global consortium of devious doctors, health professionals, and government stooges spun a convincing yarn about a virus that would ravage the world unless vaccines were developed to inoculate the population as soon as possible. The WHO had infiltrated the Russian Ministry of Health and planted agents of evil within the Council of Ministers and State Duma, and Western propaganda—fables of people sick with Covid falling dead on the street—seeped through Russia’s once secure borders. No nation was immune to the most elaborate disinformation campaign in the history of humanity.
On 2 December 2020, Russia launched its first mass vaccination experiment, beating other nations to the punch and delivering 6.9 million doses in the first week. As of 21 June 2022, 81.5 million people have received at least one dose, with 74.3 million fully vaccinated. In the West and Russia, vaccine recipients presented side effects such as cardiac ailments, seizures, and blood clots, with many dropping dead at home, at work, or in the streets.
“The American CIA is brilliant. When harmless Covid spread, they made up stories of so many people dying to get us all to beg for the vaccine. Then when the vaccines came, we did start dying, and the governments can blame it on Covid, not vaccines. It was such a clever plot, the world believed it,” Zakharov said.
In December 2022, the Ministry of Health reported a dramatic, countrywide spike in HIV infections among persons who had received three or more Covid-19 vaccinations and did not fit the standard demographic—homosexuals and needle users. Between 2015-2019, Russia averaged 16,000 new infections per year. In 2022, that figure skyrocketed to 63,000 to include celibate, non-drug users.
Vladimir Putin, Zakharov said, arrived at the inescapable conclusion that vaccines could cause a person to develop HIV and AIDS. The evidence was unassailable; the more jabs a person got, the greater the odds of contracting HIV. Putin viewed the correlation as more than a simple coincidence—the vaccine was tailored to deliver Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
“A fake sickness tricks people into getting a vaccine that gives them real sicknesses,” Zakharov said. “Only satanic people could have dreamed this up. For President Putin, this is a very personal affair.”
Putin, he added, has remained “pureblood,” or unvaccinated, but one of his daughters was diagnosed with HIV two weeks after she’d taken her third jab.
“President Putin told her not to get any more vaccines, but she is Westernized, she accepted the lies, and now she must stay on medicine her whole life. This infuriated President Putin,” Zakharov said.
The daughter’s diagnosis was the last straw. On Wednesday, Putin decreed that Covid-19 vaccines be destroyed, and he banned all vaccine imports. The Russian military, our source said, has already destroyed vaccines at hospitals in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Kazan, Chelyabinsk, Samara, Nizhny Novgorod, and Saratov, and was forced to “put down” hospital staff that resisted the vaccine purge. Putin has reportedly said he will not rest until every vial is shattered.
Also, Putin has ordered the execution of 130 scientists responsible for creating the Sputnik vaccines.
“Here we don’t bring the guilty to trial—a waste of time. Why waste time when we know they are guilty. We deal with these matters severely,” Zakharov said.
In closing, we asked Zakharov whether Putin would have ordered such drastic action had his daughter not been diagnosed with HIV.
“No, he still would take care of these criminals. But her diagnosis crystallized his hatred for these evil people. There will be no more vaccines in Russia,” he said."

Angelina Jolie is a name that is synonymous with Hollywood. She is one of the most recognizable faces in the industry and has been a fixture in the entertainment world for over two decades. She has made a name for herself as an actress, a director, a humanitarian, and a mother. However, despite her numerous accomplishments, there are some regrets that Hollywood brings about for Angelina Jolie.

One of the regrets that Angelina Jolie has spoken about is her early work as an actress. Jolie got her start in Hollywood in the mid-1990s and quickly made a name for herself with roles in films like “Hackers” and “Gia.” However, she has since spoken out about the lack of substance in some of her early work. In a 2014 interview with The Guardian, Jolie said, “I was very young; I was experimenting. I was doing a lot of dark, sexy things. And it was just silly.”

Jolie’s regret about her early work is understandable. She was a young actress trying to make a name for herself in a highly competitive industry. It’s not uncommon for actors and actresses to take on roles that they may not be proud of in the early stages of their career. However, Jolie has since gone on to prove that she is capable of much more than just playing the sexy, edgy character.

Another regret that Angelina Jolie has spoken about is her relationship with her father, actor Jon Voight. Jolie’s parents divorced when she was young, and she had a complicated relationship with her father throughout her childhood and early adulthood. In a 2011 interview with The Telegraph, Jolie said, “I think as I came into my own and started to understand myself as a woman, I realized that some of the things he had done and some of the things he had said were not okay, and I had to separate myself from him.”

Jolie and Voight have since reconciled, but the experience has clearly left a lasting impact on Jolie. It’s not uncommon for people to have complicated relationships with their parents, but it’s always difficult when those relationships are played out in the public eye.

Finally, Angelina Jolie has also expressed regret about the way that she handled her divorce from fellow actor Brad Pitt. Jolie and Pitt were one of Hollywood’s most high-profile couples and had been together for over a decade before their split in 2016. In a 2020 interview with Vogue, Jolie said, “I separated for the well-being of my family. It was the right decision. I continue to focus on their healing.”

While Jolie’s decision to leave Pitt was undoubtedly a difficult one, she has been criticized for the way that the split was handled. The divorce was highly publicized, and there were numerous rumors and reports about what had gone wrong in the relationship. Jolie has since said that she regrets the way that the split played out in the media.

In conclusion, while Angelina Jolie is a talented actress and accomplished filmmaker, there are some regrets that Hollywood brings about for her. From her early work as an actress to her complicated relationship with her father and her highly publicized divorce from Brad Pitt, Jolie has spoken openly about the things that she wishes she could do differently. However, despite these regrets, Jolie remains a respected figure in Hollywood and continues to be an inspiration to many."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_361120,"Official data made available by the U.S. Government and Centers for Disease Control strongly suggests that fully vaccinated Americans may be developing Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome or a similar disease that is decimating the innate immune system.
But they are not alone, because further data made available by the UK Government and the Government of Canada suggests the vaccinated population in both of these respective countries are also developing the debilitating condition.

It’s a common misconception that Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is only caused by the HIV virus. This simply isn’t true.
Acquired (or secondary) immunodeficiency is one of the major causes of infections in adults. These immunodeficiency disorders affect your immune system partially or as a whole, making your body an easy target for several diseases and infections. (Source)
When immunodeficiency disorders affect your immune system, your body can no longer fight bacteria and diseases. (Source)
Several factors in the environment can cause secondary immunodeficiency disorders. ‌(Source)
Some common ones are:
Radiation or chemotherapy, which can lead to a secondary immunodeficiency disorder known as neutropenia
Infections due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can result in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
Leukaemia, a cancer that begins in the cells of the bone marrow that can lead to hypogammaglobulinemia—a type of secondary immunodeficiency
Malnutrition, which affects up to 50% of populations in underdeveloped countries and leaves people vulnerable to respiratory infections and diarrhoea
But some of the less common causes include Drugs or medications. (Source)
So it’s perfectly possible for a medication or drug to cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and data published by the U.S Government and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) strongly suggests the Covid-19 injections should be added to the list.
For months on end, official data coming out of both the UK and Canada has strongly insinuated that the vaccinated population are developing a new form of AIDS. This is because the Covid-19 injections are proving to have a real-world negative effectiveness, implying that they are causing damage to the natural immune system.
Here’s a table showing the case rates per 100,000 by vaccination status in England from week 51 of 2021 to week 12 of 2022 –

The case rates per 100k were highest among the triple vaccinated population over these 3 months, except for the 18-29-year-olds in the week 3 report only, and the under 18’s in all 3 months.
Now that we know the case rates we can use Pfizer’s simple vaccine effectiveness formula to calculate the real-world Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated.
Unvaccinated Case Rate – Vaccinated Case Rate / Unvaccinated Case Rate x 100

This is nowhere near the claimed 95% effectiveness by Pfizer, is it?
However, vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipient’s immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.
Using the case rates provided by UKHSA, we can also calculate the immune system performance, here’s a chart showing how they stack up –

You can read our full investigation of the UK data here.
Data from the Government of Canada also shows much of the same. Here’s a chart showing the real-world Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness across Canada against infection, hospitalisation and death –

You can read our full investigation on the Canadian data here.
Now of course the data from the UK and Canada only implies there’s a serious issue here, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s being reflected in terms of disease and suffering associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. But unfortunately, official U.S. Government and CDC data do.
The CDC hosts a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System where adverse reactions to vaccines can be reported. The full database can be found here.
The database contains adverse reactions reported to all available vaccines in the USA, stretching as far back as 1950. So, we ran a search of the database to check for common diseases and infections associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and this is what we found.
The CDC has a helpful page listing ‘opportunistic infections associated with AIDS’ that can be viewed here. Here’s a snapshot of their provided list –

And here’s a list of what are officially dubbed ‘AIDS-defining cancers’ –

There’s an incredibly long list of ailments associated with AIDS so we cherry-picked the following –
AIDS-defining Cancers
Herpes Infection
Acquired Immune Disorders including Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome
Encephalopathy (Brain disease associated with AIDS)
Bacterial/Fungal Infections associated with AIDS (Candidiasis, Coccidioidomycosis, Cryptococcosis)
Sepsis
Myocarditis and Pericarditis
Myocarditis and Pericarditis aren’t officially associated with AIDS, but they are, however, auto-immune disorders that arise from the immune system attacking the heart. And with the two conditions being one of the only adverse reactions associated with Covid-19 vaccination to be publicised by medicine regulators, they definitely deserved a closer inspection.
To start with we did a search for AIDS-defining cancers that have been reported as adverse reactions. We first conducted a search for adverse reactions to all vaccines by year, and then adverse reactions to the Covid-19 injections.
Here’s how the CDC displays the results –

We’ve extracted the CDC displayed results to create our own charts that are easier to understand, so we will not be displaying the CDC version of results for further diseases associated with AIDS. But don’t forget you can verify the results yourself at the CDC Wonder site here.
The following chart shows the number of common cancers usually associated with AIDS that have been reported to VAERS as adverse reactions to all vaccines (including the Covid-19 jabs) by the year reported, and the Covid-19 vaccines only by the year reported –

As you can see there was a huge increase in reports in 2021 and in 2022 so far, with the vast majority being attributed to the Covid-19 injections.
The average number of common cancers associated with AIDS being reported as adverse reactions to any vaccine between the years 2000 and 2020 equates to 21.3.
The total number of common cancers associated with AIDS reported as adverse reactions in 2021 was 430. This represents a 1919% increase.
It is however important to note that not all adverse reactions are reported to VAERS. In fact, the CDC has admitted just 1 to 10% of adverse reactions are actually reported to the system. But a brilliant analysis conducted by Jessica Rose Phd accurately estimates the underreporting factor to be at least 41.3. See here.
The following chart shows the number of acquired immune disorders, including AIDS, that have been reported to VAERS as adverse reactions to all vaccines (including the Covid-19 jabs) by the year reported, and the Covid-19 vaccines only by the year reported –

Yet again there was a huge increase in reports in 2021 and in 2022 so far, with the vast majority being attributed to the Covid-19 injections.
The average number of acquired immune disorders being reported as adverse reactions to any vaccine between the years 2000 and 2020 equates to 31.
The total number of acquired immune disorders reported as adverse reactions in 2021 was 386. This represents a 1145% increase.
The following chart shows the number of herpes infections/complications that have been reported to VAERS as adverse reactions to all vaccines (including the Covid-19 jabs) by the year reported, and the Covid-19 vaccines only by the year reported –

We assume you’re beginning to see the pattern here? Another huge increase in 2021 and 2022.
The average number of herpes infections reported as adverse reactions to any vaccine between the years 2000 and 2020 equates to 926.
The total number of herpes infections reported as adverse reactions in 2021 was 18,336. This represents an 1880% increase.
The following chart shows the number of encephalopathy cases that have been reported to VAERS as adverse reactions to all vaccines (including the Covid-19 jabs) by the year reported, and the Covid-19 vaccines only by the year reported –

Encephalopathy is the result of damage to the brain, and is also known as AIDS-dementia complex.
The average number of encephalopathy cases reported as adverse reactions to any vaccine between the years 2000 and 2020 equates to 39.6.
The total number of encephalopathy cases reported as adverse reactions in 2021 was 745. This represents a 1781% increase.
The following chart shows the number of candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis and cryptococcosis infections that have been reported to VAERS as adverse reactions to all vaccines (including the Covid-19 jabs) by the year reported, and the Covid-19 vaccines only by the year reported –

The average number of AIDS-associated bacterial/fungal infections reported as adverse reactions to any vaccine between the years 2000 and 2020 equates to 15.
The total number of AIDS-associated bacterial/fungal infections reported as adverse reactions in 2021 was 382. This represents a 2447% increase.
The following chart shows the number of sepsis cases that have been reported to VAERS as adverse reactions to all vaccines (including the Covid-19 jabs) by the year reported, and the Covid-19 vaccines only by the year reported –

Sepsis is the body’s extreme response to an infection. It is a life-threatening medical emergency. Sepsis happens when an infection you already have triggered a chain reaction throughout your body. Infections that lead to sepsis most often start in the lung, urinary tract, skin, or gastrointestinal tract.
The average number of sepsis cases being reported as adverse reactions to any vaccine between the years 2000 and 2020 equates to 75.
The total number of sepsis cases reported as adverse reactions in 2021 was 1593. This represents a 2024% increase.
The following chart shows the number of myocarditis and pericarditis cases that have been reported to VAERS as adverse reactions to all vaccines (including the Covid-19 jabs) by the year reported, and the Covid-19 vaccines only by the year reported –

Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle. Pericarditis is inflammation of the protective sacs surrounding the heart. Both are auto-immune conditions, and both have been publicised by medicine regulators as possible adverse reactions to the Covid-19 injections. especially among younger males.
The average number of myo/pericarditis cases being reported as adverse reactions to any vaccine between the years 2000 and 2020 equates to 46.
The total number of acquired immune disorders reported as adverse reactions in 2021 was 15,555. This represents a 33,715% increase. Shocking, isn’t it?
The following chart shows the percentage of all of the above AIDS-associated adverse reactions reported to VAERS to all vaccines by year –

Fifty-one percent of all adverse reactions associated with AIDS reported since the year 2000 were reported in 2021, and a further 16% have been reported in 2022 so far.
Are we really to believe that this is just an unfortunate coincidence? Or are we witnessing the American public report to the Centres for Disease Control that the Covid-19 injections are causing them to develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome?
Official data from the UK and Canada already strongly suggested the Covid-19 injections were causing the fully vaccinated to develop the debilitating condition through evidence of a negative vaccine effectiveness and a negative immune system performance.
But now official data from the U.S. Government and Centers for Disease Control confirms that we probably are witnessing the fully vaccinated develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, with diseases and infections associated with AIDS reported to VAERS increasing between 1145% and 33,715% in 2021 following the introduction of the Covid-19 injections."
Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_258814,"United States Marines forensically examined Gretchen Whitmer’s vehicle and found pornography, illegal narcotics, and an iPad holding a ledger of names and ages of children who appear on the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children’s private database, a source in General Eric M. Smith’s office told Real Raw News.
As reported previously, United States Marines apprehended Whitmer and seized her car while she was returning to Lansing from a holiday weekend on the shores of Lake Michigan. The vehicle was taken to an undisclosed place for inspection.
Drugs
Upon inspecting the interior, the Marines found a Ziplock bag of white powder in the center console. The substance tested positive for cocaine and had traces of fentanyl. Our source said drug crimes—except for production of Adrenochrome–are outside White Hats’ purview, but the Marines tested the product to see if her covid-19 hypocrisy extended to illicit narcotics.
Although Whitmer supported legislation to decriminalize the use of recreational marijuana, she strengthened prison sentences on people convicted of unlawful possession of opioids and benzodiazepines and stimulants like cocaine.
Our source said Whitmer was clearly impaired at the time of the arrest. A rapid antibody test, taken when Marines moved her to a safehouse, confirmed she had not received vaccinations for Covid-19, affirming her double standards.
Pornography
With General Smith’s consent, the Marines took a crack at hacking the passcode on an iPad found in Whitmer’s car. She refused to surrender the code willingly, our source said. It took them only 15 minutes to unlock the device after using Whitmer’s birth month and year as the password. The device reportedly held “thousands” of pornographic images and a bevy of “hardcore” videos.
Viewing adult content is no crime; if adults wish to partake in the devil’s playground, it’s their choice.
The Marines examining the iPad said it had mock, or role-play, rape sessions featuring Eastern European women and Black men, who appeared to be adults—no evidence of child pornography was found on the iPad.
Child Trafficking
But the same iPad had a spreadsheet listing the names and genders of 50 missing kids, all of whom were kidnapped or had vanished into thin air during Whitmer’s tenure as governor. None of them, however, were residents of the Great Lake State. Twelve had disappeared from national parks in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming while on family trips, and 14 others were kidnapped inside grocery stores and shopping malls. Our source did not disclose the disposition of the remainder, but he said all 50 were between 6-14 years old.
When asked to explain the database, Whitmer told the Marines she oversaw a government committee investigating missing children nationwide, although no record of such a group exists.
Our source said the iPad has been sent to Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command for a comprehensive inspection."
Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_890624,"The White Hat partition of the United States military thwarted the Deep State’s attempt to cripple the U.S. power grid and cause mass chaos over Memorial Day Weekend, sources in General Eric M. Smith’s office told Real Raw News.
Ahead of the holiday, the general’s office received “credible intelligence” that the Deep State was planning a multi-pronged attack against two of the country’s synchronous grids, the Eastern and the Western Interconnections, which collectively power tens of millions of homes. The Eastern Interconnection reaches from central Canada to the Atlantic Coast, south to Florida, and back to the foot of the Rockies. The Western Interconnection stretches from western Canada, south to Baja, California, reaching eastward over the Rockies to the great plains. Texas, which has independent transmission lines disconnected from the national grid, was not included in the attack plan.
According to our source, a CIA whistleblower on May 19 arrived at Camp Pendleton with a dire warning, saying the criminal Biden regime had put in motion an intricate mission to hack the grid and throw the country into turmoil. He reportedly had digital documents, approved by CIA Director William Burns, outlining the Deep State’s methods and motives for wanting to plunge the U.S. into darkness.
At 9:00 p.m. EST, May 26, the Deep State would activate the virus, the whistleblower said.
By May 10, the CIA had hired “foreign actors” to man “remote intrusion centers” in Colorado and Georgia with the hardware necessary to deliver virus into the mainframes of American Electric Power and other major electric companies. The documents said the persons hired to man the intrusion centers were among the world’s most skilled cybersecurity experts.
The virus would systematically collapse the grid from coast to coast, and power companies’ engineers, whose job is to monitor the reliability of energy transmission, would be powerless to mitigate or immediately purge the virus. The CIA’s documents projected 48 hours of darkness, after which the virus would “self-extinguish,” and transmission providers would resolve the issue and gradually restore service to their customers.
By then, the CIA calculated the country would be a tempestuous wreck.
Had darkness stricken the land, FEMA insurrectionists, looters, and, yes, rapists would have run amok across the country, inciting civil disobedience and mayhem. They were to pillage homes and businesses and shoot any resistance wantonly. Meanwhile, Feds embedded in national militia groups would instigate members to take up arms, telling their troops the Deep State was taking over.
From a replica of the Oval Office, Biden would blame the crisis on Chinese saboteurs and promise Americans that his administration was doing everything possible to restore power and order.
As the nation descended into madness, Biden would tell the world that MAGA adherents were slaughtering Democrat lawmakers—torch and pitchfork style—from California to New York. He would unleash the Department of Justice on patriots stirred to action by government informants masquerading as patriots.
Worse, the CIA assessment seemed more interested in provoking patriots and “testing Americans’ resolve” than addressing the catastrophic collateral damage and loss of life associated with their “exercise.” Aircraft departures nationwide would halt, and planes in flight would race to land or divert before airport backup generators failed and runways went dark. The chances of a significant incident were high. On the ground, railway switches could fail, intensifying the odds of collisions and derailments. The number of potential cataclysms is endless.
After two days of darkness, the regime would magically restore power and applaud itself for quickly resolving the unpreventable outage. Biden would recant the story of Chinese saboteurs and apologize to Xi Jinping for making unforgivable errors. Instead, he would blame Vladimir Putin for the blackout and call for increased funding for Ukraine.
The scenario mentioned above might have played out had White Hats not interceded.
Our source said Gen. Smith allowed the spook on base because he had in the past supplied credible tips. FBI and CIA “5th Columnists” have proven instrumental in aiding the White Hats’ war against the Deep State.
The whistleblower, however, didn’t know where in Colorado and Georgia the Deep State had set up intrusion centers. He told Gen. Smith he’d endeavor to learn the locations, and the general mustered an untold number of White Hats to action, ordering them to call in every favor owed in hopes of gleaning the whereabouts of the Deep State’s cyber infiltration facilities.
They had less than a week to solve the dilemma.
Gen. Smith appraised President Trump of the situation and asked whether it was time to trigger the EBS, which White hats seized in March 2022 during an assault on FEMA’s Mount Weather stronghold. Trump told the general to hold off on the EBS while he, too, ruminated over the looming crisis and called in “huge favors people owe me.” Triggering the EBS too early, Trump said, might spark patriots into taking up arms, an act that would give the Deep State practical reason to retaliate against patriotic Americans truly.
Over the next two days, U.S. Army Rangers, Special Forces, and Delta Force hit dead ends in Augusta, Georgia and Colorado Springs, Colorado. Acting on tips, they had breached two warehouses but found them empty, devoid of computers and internet connections.
Our source said White Hats stormed several more empty structures and were losing hope when President Trump phoned Gen. Smith with tips that had verisimilitude. President Trump would not reveal the identity of his source and said the Deep State’s bunkers were near Pueblo, Colorado and Athens, Georgia. He even had GPS coordinates.
Special Forces went at once to Colorado, while Delta left for Georgia.
In Pueblo, Special Forces surveyed an automotive repair shop with a “closed until further notice” sign hanging above the office door. The two bay doors were closed, and the parking area was empty. From a distance they glassed the building and through a window saw computers atop two desks, but no people and no tools endemic to a vehicle repair shop.
As Special Forces monitored the Pueblo shop, Delta Force in Athens had eyes on what should have been a laundromat. But the interior had several computer terminals instead of washers and dryers and tables for folding clothes.
“There was no question we found the right places,” our source said. “Then came the decision to either shut them down on the spot or wait until the 23rd to see who showed up. “Gen. Smith chose to wait; he wanted to catch and identify the criminals–or kill them. He knew we’d be playing it close.”
At 6:00 p.m. EST, May 26, a white Ford Econoline van pulled into the parking lot at the Pueblo automotive shop. Three men of undistinguishable origin, each packing a Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun, exited the vehicle and walked to the entrance. The lead target was fumbling with a keyring when a bullet hit him between the eyes. He fell dead. Another round dropped the second perpetrator, leaving only one villain left. He raised his rifle and fired blindly into the air, emptying the magazine, then dashed for the van. Six Special Forces arose from the shadows and subdued him.
They used him as a shield to open the door in case the inside had booby traps. The pungent scent of gasoline assailed their nostrils when they set foot inside. No traps. But Ziplock bags filled with gas had been taped to the walls, ostensibly to put the place ablaze after the would-be cyber terrorists had finished their work. Special Forces confiscated the computers; they loaded their prisoner and the corpses into unmarked vehicles parked a few blocks away.
Delta Force met with a similar scenario in Georgia. This time, though, no shots were fired. A yellow Hummer with four occupants had parked behind the laundromat. No sooner had they opened the doors than Delta operators pulled them from the vehicle and incapacitated them. After gagging and zip-tying the prisoners, they removed the hardware from the ‘laundromat.’
President Trump was immediately given an assessment, our source said.
“Thanks to brave men and President Trump, a disaster has been averted. We want CIA Director Burns, but he’s left the reservation. I haven’t been given a sitrep on the prisoners’ interrogations. America should breathe a sigh of relief,” our source said."

According to the WEF, humanity will be better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future if unborn children undergo gene editing to ensure they are free of diseases and disabilities, including psychological traits which the elite disapprove of.

The WEF is laying the groundwork to take over every aspect of our lives.
Before we dive in, subscribe to the channel if you haven’t already, and join the People’s Voice Locals community for exclusive and uncensored content, and to interact with our awesome community.
Not content with editing the genes of everybody who signed up for an experimental mRNA jab, the global elite are now threatening to edit the genes of our children – before they are even born.
To perpetrate this crime against humanity, the WEF have been developing artificial wombs which will be able to develop a fetus outside of a mother’s body.

Given the the deeply Satanic nature of the WEF agenda, it would have been more appropriate if the scientists experimented on bringing a horned goat to life.
Growing human babies from scratch in a lab could be possible in just five years thanks to a new breakthrough.
Now WEF-funded researchers in Japan are on the cusp of being able to create human eggs and sperm in the lab from scratch, without the need for human sexual reproduction. These lab-grown human eggs and sperm will then develop in an artificial womb.
Professor Katsuhiko Hayashi, a Japanese scientist at Kyushu University who has already figured out the process in mice, believes they are just five years away from replicating the results in humans and allowing the elite to implement their long-held dreams of playing god with the human race. 
But there are ethical concerns, as it means women of any age, including per-pubescent girls, could give birth. Babies may also be designed to have certain traits using gene-editing tools, giving way to the notion of an assumed perfect child. 
And given who is funding this project, it is worth asking: what do the global elite think the perfect gene-edited human specimen of the future looks like?
In case you are still wondering what is driving the elites’ agenda, Klaus Schwab’s right hand man, Yuval Noah Harari, who is known as “the Prophet” among the Davos crowd, has doubled down on the elite’s plans to play God.
In his deeply disturbing manifesto, Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, Harari dropped strong hints about the traits the elites are planning to gene-edit into future generations of compliant, docile human beings by building a “genetic child catalogue.”
We apologize for the unpleasant robotic voice reading Harari’s text… but it kinda fits his soulless, godless vision for humanity.

Harari couldn’t resist reminding us that only a select few of the earth’s current billions of inhabitants will be lucky enough to survive the great depopulation.
They want us under a totalitarian control system and they want us genetically incapable of resistance. To achieve this, Harari and his cronies are resurrecting eugenics, with a modern twist.
Harari has been excitedly declaring that God is dead, and the WEF are assuming divine powers of creation and destruction, and the mainstream media has almost completely ignored their evil agenda.
While the media have provided cover for these technocommunist psychopaths, the elite have been allowed to work towards the eradication of our sovereignty at national and individual levels. This is serfdom 2.0.
They have admitted that their intention is to deprive us of everything, consume insects as food, reside in confined spaces, and be desensitized by virtual reality devices and pharmaceutical drugs. In this future, the global state will own everything. They will even own us.
The implementation of this plan is already underway.
This is a naked power grab by unelected elites. They are determined to gain control over every aspect of your life, including the genetics of your unborn children. This is a globalist totalitarian dictatorship and we must spread the word about their plans so we can defeat them.
Klaus Schwab has told us that the CCP’s China is the model for the future of the world. Is this a world you want for your children and your children’s children?
At this hour, it is not hyperbole to say that our most basic freedoms, and the freedom of future generations, depend on how we respond to the threat of this globalist coup.
These shadowy elites have been working quietly behind the scenes for decades, but in recent years we have exposed them to the light. And we are slowly but surely winning the fight. More and more people are waking up to their agenda.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_624191,"A massive pedophile ring involving high-ranking officials has been uncovered on Instagram by Wall Street Journal reporters this week.

WSJ and researchers at Stanford University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst conducted a large-scale investigation on Instagram’s algorithm and found that not only does Instagram host pedophile content, it specifically sells access to child rape to pedophiles using pizzagate code words.

Per the WSJ:

Infowars.com reports: But it gets much worse. The investigation also found some content “menus” also featured children harming themselves, engaging in sex acts with animals, and had options to arrange “meet ups.”

The pedophile network also employed the use of “cheese pizza” and “map” emojis to communicate with each other, the Journal reported.

Parent-company Meta Platforms told the WSJ it “acknowledged problems” within its enforcement of content violation rules but assured the paper it already took down “27 pedophile networks” with more on the way.
Alex Stamos, the head of the Stanford Internet Observatory and Meta’s former chief security officer said it would be difficult to eradicate the pedophile networks on Meta.
“That a team of three academics with limited access could find such a huge network should set off alarms at Meta,” he said, adding the company has much better tools to map out these pedophile networks than outsiders do.
“I hope the company reinvests in human investigators,” he added.
What Stamos fails to realize is these social media companies are also comprised mostly of liberals, who have become sympathetic in recent years to pedophiles as an oppressed group, so it may take even longer than he realizes to stop these pedophile networks on Instagram.
Another instance of secret communications using mentions of pizzas and maps were found in Clinton campaign manager John Podesta’s emails published by WikiLeaks in 2016, which ended up sparking the so-called “PizzaGate” conspiracy theory."
Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_228670,"The United States military on Friday arrested an obscure regime official on charges of treason after acquiring evidence that she had misused her authority to bankrupt small businesses during the Plandemic lockdowns of 2021, a JAG source told Real Raw News.
US Navy JAG investigators apprehended Small Business Administration Administer Isabella Guzman at her home in Washington, DC, after showing her a military arrest warrant alleging that she threatened small business owners with unaffordable fines and jail time unless they adhered to Covid-19 protocols. These rules reportedly included ensuring that employers enforced vaccination, face mask, and social distancing mandates, spent funds on erecting plexiglass barriers between employees and customers, and denied service to customers unwilling to present vaccination certificates. Guzman’s position, our source said, afforded her none of these powers.
The SBA is a mysterious independent agency of the US government. On paper, its mission statement is “to maintain and strengthen the nation’s economy by enabling the establishment and viability of small businesses and by assisting in the economic recovery of communities after disasters.” It was created on July 30, 1953, by Republican President Eisenhower with the signing of the Small Business Act, currently codified at 15 USC ch. 14A. In short, the agency’s job is to aid small businesses in financial distress.
In March 2021, the criminal Joseph R. Biden tapped Guzman to lead the SBA, and she was sworn in by Kamala Harris. Guzman was reported out of the Senate Small Business Committee by a 15–5 vote and confirmed on March 16, 2021, in an 81–17 vote of the United States Senate. Influential Republicans such as Lindsay Graham and Mitch McConnell affirmed her nomination.
Guzman was flying under the radar until White Hats became aware of her Covid crimes in May 2023.
According to our source, a Covid criminal caught earlier this year ratted out Guzman. In May, White Hats apprehended CDC Deputy Director for Global Health, Dr. Howard Zucker, for Covid crimes like those committed by Guzman. Zucker avoided a military tribunal and accepted a lengthy prison stay in exchange for naming administration officials who had violated their oath of office during the Plandemic.
In September 2021, after illegitimate President Joseph Biden called the faux virus a “Pandemic of the unvaccinated,” Guzman oversaw a team whose job was to frighten independent business owners into Covid compliance. A JAG investigation revealed, for example, that Guzman terrorized a small pizzeria in Richmond, Virginia, demanding the owners spend $45,000 on frivolous “improvements” such as plexiglass shields between staff and customers and a new HVAC for improved air circulation.
Most small restaurants operate on narrow margins and do not have $45k in discretionary funds.
When the owner refused to waste cash on unnecessary upgrades, Guzman went to the Virginia Department of Health. A week later, the owner received a letter saying he would be fined $2500/day unless he heeded CDC guidance. He ultimately acquiesced—and had to file for bankruptcy three months later.
A monthlong JAG investigation determined that Guzman and her proxies made similar demands on thousands of small businesses nationwide, many of which had been fined so heavily that the owners had to shut down.
“What this shows us—the corrupt and illegal Biden administration used every agency to enforce unlawful, draconian Covid laws. It wasn’t just the CDC and the NIH—the treachery goes much deeper, and there’s no telling how many others like Guzman are still walking free,” our source said.
JAG hopes Guzman will lead investigators to other Covid criminals, he added."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_147010,"A comprehensive study has found that no Amish children have been diagnosed with chronic conditions that impact the rest of America.
Across America, the current population of Amish people is quickly approaching 400,000.
The largest concentrations of Amish citizens are 90,000 in Pennsylvania and 82,000 in Ohio.
Amish communities have settled in as many as 32 U.S. states.
Families have an average of 7 kids so the Amish population is growing rapidly.
The Amish are a group of traditionalist Christians who are known for simple living, plain dress, and Christian pacifism.
They reject most conveniences of modern technology and pharmaceuticals and maintain self-sufficiency.
The Amish value rural life, manual labor, humility, and Gelassenheit (submission to God’s will) with a view neither to interrupt family time nor replace face-to-face conversations whenever possible.
Yet, despite rejecting all modern medicine and pharmaceutical drugs that the rest of the American people have access to, the Amish are among the healthiest in the nation.
As Slay News recently reported, a study conducted by the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation (VSRF) found that Covid death rates among Amish communities are 90 times lower than for the rest of America.
The main difference, the study revealed, is that Amish communities completely ignored the guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Amish families did not get vaccinated or wear masks, nor did they engage in lockdowns, social distancing, or any other type of restrictions.
But the separated communities didn’t avoid catching the virus, however, as roughly 90% of the Amish have been infected with Covid.

In a new comprehensive study, presented by VSRF founder Steve Kirsch to the Pennsylvania State Senate, it was calculated that for Amish children, who are strictly 100 percent unvaccinated, typical chronic conditions barely exist, if any at all.
These chronic conditions, which many vaccinated children and swaths of Americans suffer from, include auto-immune disease, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, ADHD, arthritis, cancer, and autism.
During testimony before the PA Senate, expert health advocates shared details on why there have never been any reports published regarding the health of Amish children in general.
“After decades of studying the Amish, there’s no report because the report would be devastating to the narrative,” Kirsch testified.

“It would show that the CDC has been harming the public for decades and saying nothing and burying all the data.”
Leading American cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough has dozens of peer-reviewed published works related to the rise of chronic conditions among the public.
McCullough has testified before the U.S. Senate and before legislatures throughout the U.S. regarding the dangers of mRNA jabs.
Kirsch and McCullough joined top attorney Thomas Renz and medicolegal death investigator Graham Hetrick on a panel of experts who testified before the Pennsylvania State Senate.
The experts all noted that chronic conditions are soaring among the American people.
However, they concluded that these conditions are non-existent among unvaxxed Amish communities.
According to the VSRF study, not one single Amish child could be found who had suffered from cancer, autism, heart disease, or other conditions that are on the rise among American children."

72% of the IUS death reports in the 33 year history of VAERS are from one vaccine: the COVID-19 vaccine.
Unlike other vaccines, the COVID vaccines keep on killing people, for months and years after the shot.
The statistics I’ve been able to collect estimate that the COVID vaccines kill 1 person per 1,000 doses. These vaccines aren’t close to safe, so we don’t even have to get into a discussion as to whether they are effective.
They are clearly unsafe and nobody should be taking them.
And we can prove that with one VAERS query which nobody can explain away. Anyone can replicate this themselves.

The VAERS query

Go to medalerts.org, and set the parameters are follows:
Graph the Onset Interval and Vaccines
Died: Yes
Demographics: US states

and

VAERS result

The line with all the deaths is the COVID vaccine.
Found 16,396 cases where Location is U.S. States and Patient Died

Figure 1. The onset curve of the COVID vaccine looks nothing like any other vaccine in US history.

Figure 2. The legend for Figure 1

What does this mean?

It means that the COVID vaccines are killing people.
The onset interval is the interval from the time of vaccination until the first symptoms occurred. Since we are looking at death reports, these will be the time until the first symptoms preceding the death appear or, in many cases, the elapsed time until the death itself.
A safe vaccine should have a peak near day 0 just due to coincidence causing false reports in the first few days after the vaccine as people falsely associate the death event with the date of vaccination. The rest of the curve should be flat. This is the case for many of the vaccines. For example, the Rubella vaccine doesn’t have a single death report in the history of VAERS (but does have 800 adverse event reports).
The flu vaccine (FLU4) has an onset curve for deaths that looks like this, but keep in mind that the FLU4 vaccine can be given with other vaccines in the same visit, so it’s hard to separate out just the effect of the FLU4 vaccine, but the point is that if vaccines are safe, the death rates reported after the vaccines should be perfectly flat since deaths are random with respect to a vaccination date.

Figure 3. The onset curve for deaths for the FLU4 vaccine. Compare that to the COVID vaccine in Figure 1.

What you can see from Figure 1 above is that the COVID vaccines don’t look at all like a safe vaccine: the peaks of deaths just keep going and going. The peaks end after 2.5 years because the COVID vaccines have only been out for 2.5 years.
In particular, note that:
the peak at 90-120 days is larger than the peaks at 0 and 1 days
the peak at 15-30 days is nearly as high as the peaks at 0 and 1 days
the peak at 1-2 years is unprecedented
For the COVID vaccine, it’s not even close to that.
Many other vaccines show a death peak 15-30 days out. This is clearly caused by the vaccines. In other words, many of the vaccines the CDC believes are safe are, in fact, killing people.

72% of the deaths in the history of VAERS are from the COVID vaccine

VAERS queries show:
Found 11,860 cases where Location is U.S. States and Vaccine is COVID19 or COVID19-2 and Patient Died
Found 16,396 cases where Location is U.S. States and Patient Died
This is 72.3% of all deaths are from the COVID vaccines. This is extraordinary. The sheer number of deaths here as well as the onset interval above, are clear evidence we have the most deadly vaccine in US history that we are forcing people to take.

Death rate from the COVID vaccine: 1 per 1,000 doses

I’ve written in the past about the death rates from the COVID vaccine.
Recently, Denis Rancourt looked at large population data in Australia and Israel and estimated a rate of 1 death per 1,000 doses (see page 23: “… it is not unreasonable to assume an all-population global value of vDFR = 0.1%).
My estimates agree with this. In fact, just recently, I heard Jay Bonnar’s anecdote which confirms this. Jay had 15 friends, all vaccinated, die unexpectedly. There were about 14,000 vaccines given to his friends. So his story is right in line with my 1 in 1,000 estimate. I’ll be writing about Jay in my next Substack.
From VAERS, we have a minimum of 11,500 excess deaths (assuming we only count deaths that we know for sure were in the US) and an under-reporting factor of 41, we get 471,000 vaccine-caused deaths at a minimum (since 41 is the best case under-reporting factor). This conservative estimate is a death rate of 1 per 1,400 doses, which is lower than my 1 in 1,000 best estimate.
But if we use a more realistic value of 17,729 deaths (where we exclude foreign deaths which are typically well identified), subtract out 500 “coincidental” deaths, 17,529*50 (where 50 is a more realistic factor for deaths since 41 was for the very best case of anaphylaxis), we get 876,000 deaths from 676M COVID vaccine doses administered, which means the death rate estimated from VAERS is that we are killing 1.3 people per 1,000 doses (i.e., we are killing 1 person for every 770 doses).
We can also look at independent surveys that have not been retracted in the peer-reviewed literature because they weren’t published in the peer-reviewed literature.
To date, there has only been one independent survey (by Rasmussen) that has ever been done comparing COVID death counts to COVID vaccine death counts. So I’m not cherry picking… this is the ONLY survey. The Rasmussen survey found that a comparable number of people died from the vaccine as from COVID. My own surveys, done by independent polling firms using their lists, not mine, found exactly the same thing: the vaccine has killed as many people as COVID. There are 1.1M cumulative deaths from COVID. But probably half of those are people who died with COVID, so maybe 600K true COVID deaths. So this suggests around 600,000 vaccine deaths which is very close to my 1 in 1,000 doses estimate.
We can also look at excess death rates in places likely to have good counts, high vaccination rates, and not in the public eye such as the province of Alberta. The data shows all-cause mortality jumped by 20% from 2019 vs. 2021. If half of that was COVID and half was the COVID vaccine this would match the predicted 10% increase in all-cause mortality caused by the vaccine.
Another clue is to look at COVID death rates post vaccine to see if the vaccine might be saving lives. These rates should have dropped after the vaccine rolled out if the vaccines worked. Yet COVID hospitalizations in Ontario were up by 31% in 2022 and deaths were up by 39% in 2022. But the variants were less deadly. COVID deaths were around 7% of overall deaths.
We can look at rates published in the BMJ: 20,000 doses of the COVID vaccine created 23 new suspicious deaths in Norway which is an excess death rate that exceeds 1 in 1,000 excess deaths per dose.
We can look at anecdotes in our local community, such as skilled nursing facilities after the vaccine rollout. There isn’t a single “success” story that anyone has ever heard of. Instead, we get stories like this one where 25% of the residents just dropped dead within days after getting the COVID vaccine and there’s a complete press blackout.
So I’ll stick with my more conservative 1 death per 1,000 doses and I feel pretty good about that being a pretty good estimate. It’s nearly midway between the two VAERS estimates as well ((471+876)/2=674K deaths)! And it’s also very close to the number Mark Skidmore got from his surveys before they unethically retracted his paper (Skidmore just looked at 2021 deaths in his estimate of 278,000 people for COVID vaccine deaths the first year).

Huh? Why wouldn’t this have shown up in the clinical trials with 22,000 people in the treatment arm?

If the COVID vaccine was killing 1 person per 1,000 doses over 2 years, then 44 people should have died unexpectedly in the Pfizer trial in the vaccine arm. In a 6 month observation period, this would amount to 11 excess deaths in the vaccine arm, but there were only 4 excess deaths in the vaccine arm assuming they were able to track all the deaths accurately.
There are several explanations for this:
A 0.1% overall increase in all-cause mortality (ACM) is an overall 10% increase is base rate ACM. Nobody’s going to notice a change this small. This is what makes this vaccine so insidious: the death rate is just below the “notice” threshold.
In the Pfizer trials, there were 21 deaths in the vaccine group and 17 in the placebo group (see this article). My conservative estimate was 10% increase in ACM, but a 23% increase was observed. So my estimate looks conservative. Also, there were 4 cardiac deaths in the vaccine group vs. 1 in the placebo group. Three excess cardiac deaths on a base of around 20 deaths is a 15% increase. So using this metric as well, we appear to be “in range” on our 1 per 1,000 estimate. Even though this could be interpreted as causing 22 deaths in the vaccine arm, the 1 in 1,000 should be interpreted as a 10% increase in ACM which in this case was very low (it was a 6 month study in a very healthy group who died at a rate much lower than the general population). Jay Bonnar, who knows around 5,600 vaccinated people had 15 deaths from the vaccine over 2.5 years which is 3 deaths in a 6 month period. The clinical trial had 4X as many people, so we’d expect to see 12 deaths from the vaccine.
It wasn’t the same vaccine that was used in the trials vs. in commercial production. The commercial vaccines were more dangerous and had a variation in the lethality mix.
They may have undercounted the deaths because some were lost to follow up. How hard did they try?

The lack of a single success anecdote should be very troubling to everyone

If the vaccine really work to reduce all-cause mortality (ACM), it should be EASY to find a geriatric medical practice where the ACM of the vaccinated is lower than the ACM of the unvaccinated; it should be nearly 100% of all practices in the US. But so far, I've been unable to locate even a single one. Weird, isn't it?

Here’s my latest attempt:

Summary

A simple VAERS query on the COVID vaccines for death and looking at the onset interval makes it immediately obvious to anyone that the COVID vaccines are the most deadly vaccines in the 33 year history of the VAERS system. Nothing else is even close.
The people who work at the CDC are paid to look the other way and mislead America into thinking the COVID vaccines are safe.
There is no possible way these vaccines are safe. In my next article, I’ll talk more about the Jay Bonnar case and I’ll make this crystal clear to everyone."
Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_552846,"United States Marines on Monday captured Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and killed his two bodyguards during a military-sanctioned operation to apprehend the fiendish clot shot manufacturer following his return to the United States, a source in General Eric M. Smith’s office told Real Raw News.

Bourla, a Greek American veterinarian, was last seen in the U.S. on November 8, 2022, the day after Special Forces arrested Moderna CEO Stephen Bancel at a posh D.C. eatery. Our source said the military believes Bourla learned of Bancel’s arrest and “got the hell out of Dodge” before he became the next target. White Hats learned later that Bourla had returned to Athens, from where he had been overseeing Pfizer’s global operations and devising ways of once again convincing world citizens to take his deadly booster shots.

White Hats had routinely intercepted communications between Bourla and his friends, family, and associates in the United States. In early July, Bourla contacted his son, Mois Bourla, saying he would visit the U.S. in early August but was unwilling to provide his itinerary. When Bourla said he would make contact after “taking care of a few things,” Mois tried to discourage his father from entering the U.S. because he had now and then seen “military cars” parked outside his Chicago, Illinois home. Bourla assured Mois he would take every precaution and plan for every contingency prior to leaving Athens.

“Mois Bourla was clearly paranoid. If we had surveillance on the house, or Albert Bourla’s Scarsdale, New York, residence, it wouldn’t be with military vehicles. We’re not that conspicuous.”

On August 4, ARCYBER intercepted an email Bourla had sent to his son. In it, Bourla wrote he had safely arrived in the U.S. and asked his son to meet him at “the prearranged location” in 72 hours. “I’ve exercised caution; you do the same,” the email closed.

Although a traceroute suggested the email originated in Hawaii, ARCYBER quickly discovered that Bourla had sent it via a Virtual Private Network, or VPN, which allows one to connect to the Internet securely and anonymously.

Upon receiving the email, Mois booked a one-way ticket to Maui for the next morning.

“A lot wasn’t adding up. If Mois thought he was being watched, and he was, just not with military vehicles, why would he book the flight from his home computer? We don’t think he’s stupid. Gen. Smith thought the whole thing was a misdirection, a distraction, and Bourla probably wasn’t even in Hawaii. It seemed planned like they were trying to throw us off the trail,” our source said.

Regardless, Gen. Smith arranged to put an undercover agent on Mois’ 7:00 a.m. flight to Maui.

“If Mois was going to meet up with his father, it could’ve been during the stopover. A surveillance team was ready to tail Mois to the airport. We wanted to see if he actually got on that plane,” our source said.

A limousine chauffeured Mois to Chicago-O’Hare International Airport at 5:00 a.m.. He boarded his scheduled flight, which departed Chicago at 7:15 a.m., with the connecting flight leaving San Francisco at 5:00 p.m. and finally landing in Maui at 7:30 (local time.)

Meanwhile, ARCYBER reexamined every one of Bourla’s emails, phone calls, and text messages it had trapped since the start of the Plandemic, hoping to find a pattern establishing Bourla’s actual destination. There were hundreds to his wife, Myriam Ilkhanate, in Scarsdale, New York, and to his daughter, Graziella, also in New York. Bourla’s writings were polemic lamentations bewailing his exile—he blamed President Trump and a “corrupt U.S. military” for attributing “excess deaths” in the U.S. and abroad to his “lifesaving vaccine.” He repeatedly said he couldn’t return to the U.S. until Trump was “behind bars” and Biden “restored American order.” Bourla had often reached out to colleagues at Pfizer’s New York City headquarters, but none of the intercepts mentioned taking a sabbatical in the U.S.

ARCYBER analyzed a February 2023 email exchange between Bourla and Rachel King, acting CEO of Biotechnology Innovation Organization, on whose board of directors Bourla had previously served. A cursory investigation revealed that Bourla and King held chairs at the World Economic Forum.

In three emails to King, Bourla had suspiciously and irrelevantly included the numbers “8,” “9,” and “23.”

“Rachel, as you might imagine, I am eager to return to the U.S. where I can better perform my responsibilities. I must wait until the climate there changes, and hopefully soon. I am wondering, now, if it has been 8 or 9 years. I think 8, but I can’t be sure. Maybe 9. I was wondering about this on the 23rd of last month…” part of one email read.

“While Mois’ flight was still airborne, Cyber Command deduced the 8 and 9 denoted months and the 23 a year, this year. It seemed to be Bourla’s not-so-clever code that he’d be visiting her, for whatever reason, in August or September 2023,” our source said.

Gen. Smith immediately sent USMC reconnaissance teams to stake out King’s residences in Long Island City, New York, Washington, D.C., and Newport Beach, California. By the time Mois’ flight touched down in Maui, they had set up surveillance on all three properties.

The operative aboard the plane shadowed Mois from the airport to a hotel near Wailea Beach, but Albert Bourla was nowhere to be seen.

At 11:00 a.m. Monday, Marines in Newport Beach spotted a limousine approaching a private road that led to a cul-de-sac holding only a single dwelling, King’s three-story, 7,500 sq. ft. palatial estate. As the limo entered the dead-end street, trapping itself, 7 marines in two SUVs pulled behind it. Whoever was behind the limo’s wheel jammed on the brakes and exited the car with a pistol in his hand. He took cover behind the driver’s side door and fired blindly at the SUVs. As his rounds sliced through the air, the person in the front passenger seat appeared and brandished a Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun. “Stay in the car and keep your head down,” he shouted, then joined the assault.

The attackers soon realized their pursuers were inside armored SUVs with bulletproof glass.

The driver caught a bullet in the face when his head popped out above the door for a better look.

A Marine sniper camouflaged in a nearby tree was supplying overwatch.

The Marines ordered the remaining guard to surrender. “We don’t want you. We want the man in the back seat. Surrender and live. Don’t and die,” he was told.

“I’m dead either way!” the man shouted as he charged the SUVs, spraying bullets at a windshield.

He took a few steps before the sniper’s second shot left a cavity in his skull.

The Marines found Bourla cowering in the rear of the limo. He was too shocked to speak or resist.

“King wasn’t even home at the time. Bourla got there early. We sanitized the scene, and Bourla is now in custody. Want to know something unironic? Bourla’s parents are Holocaust survivors, and their son caused the birth of a second holocaust that killed tens of millions and is still killing hundreds of people every day,” our source said.

In closing, we asked whether Mois, too, was captured.

“We have no proof Mois was complicit in his father’s crimes. Unlike the Klingons, we don’t hold a son accountable for the crimes of a father. He was complicit in the misdirection, sure, but what son wouldn’t protect his father, even an evil son-of-bitch like Albert Bourla. Fact is, Bourla got himself caught. If he hadn’t included his son in his convoluted plot, we never would’ve known.”

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_127561,"United States Marines on Friday “neutralized” a FEMA convoy that fled fire-stricken Lahaina for Haleakalā National Park, a 33,000-acre wilderness and home to the state’s highest peak, Mount Haleakalā, from where FEMA might have escaped had the Marines not downed a helicopter sent to rescue the federal brigands.
The chase began early Friday morning when a Marine platoon and FEMA had a shootout in the Maui Forest Reserve east of Lahaina Beach. Responding to intelligence reports, the Marines caught FEMA red-handed burying corpses in an earthen grave the feds had excavated with a backhoe. A procession of FEMA agents hauled the bodies of men, women, and children out of an M35 “deuce and a Half” cargo truck and heaped them atop one another as federal supervisors stood around smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee.
The Marines had dismounted a distance away and had crept into FEMA’s AO undetected. FEMA, Real Raw News’ source in Gen. Smith’s office would later say, were more interested in cracking insensitive jokes about the dead than posting lookouts to watch for White Hat forces.
The Marines had taken cover in the dense foliage and behind trees before opening fire on federal forces. A dozen feds fell at once, cut down by streams of Marine fire. Some FEMA screamed in terror, “Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot! We give up!” while others unholstered pistols or unslung rifles in a desperate but futile effort to return fire. Their shots hit only grass and trees.
The cowardly agents who wouldn’t fight hit the deck and crawled through the foliage to their nearby vehicles, unmarked SUVs and an armored FEMA Mobile Command Center (MBC.) Some found their tires deflated, but a few vehicles survived the assault.
The “Deuce and a Half” driver was shot in the face through the windshield when he keyed the ignition.
A dozen FEMA—and FBI embedded among them—survived the initial onslaught and fled the gunfight in two SUVs and the MBC. Sixteen Marines in four Hummers gave chase, while the remaining Marines remained behind to mop up stragglers and recover the dead civilians at the mass gravesite.
The Marines pursued FEMA northeast along Route 36 to the Route 37 intersection in Kahuli, then southeast along Route 37 toward Pukalani, and, further on, the precarious, swerving road ending at the Haleakalā National Park entrance—a several hours’ drive.
Our source said the Marines did not engage en route due to the risk of endangering civilians.
FEMA dismounted at Kalahaku Overlook, a cliff overlooking the expansive Haleakalā crater, and formed a defensive perimeter around their vehicles as a UH-60 chopper in the distance drew nearer to the bluff.
The Marines, our source said, had requested air support from Marine Corps Base Hawaii, otherwise known as K-Bay, in Oahu, but they were told to expect a gunship, an AH-1Z Viper, not an extraction bird.
The Blackhawk did not respond to the Marines’ radio calls.
FEMA had popped green smoke, universally recognized as “friendly forces ready for extraction.”
As the Blackhawk descended, ready to hover, it was suddenly hit by three grenades fired from a belt-fed MK19 grenade launcher mounted atop a Marine Hummer. One clipped the rotor mast. The second flew into an open door. Smoke and flame engulfed the bird, which tumbled out of the sky and down into Haleakalā crater.
The Viper arrived after the Marines turned the MK19 on FEMA’s MBC. Its armor wasn’t dense enough to survive several direct hits. Anyone inside burned to a crisp, died of smoke inhalation, or turned into minced meat.
The Marines waved off the tardy bird, saying they controlled the situation.
The remaining FEMA agents fell like dominos.
The Marines, our source said, found 113 bodies in the back of the “Deuce and a Half” and at the gravesite.
Later that night, a 737 loaded with FEMA personnel left Kahului Airport, destination unknown."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_208795,"United States Marines on Saturday arrested Deputy Administrator of FEMA Erik Hooks on charges of treason, alleging in a 34-page indictment that Hooks and his boss, Deanne Criswell, ordered agents in Maui to deny fire victims food and water, to inhibit civilian relief efforts, to stop “by any means necessary” displaced persons from exiting fire-ravaged Lahaina, and to dispose of bodies as “discriminately as possible,” a source in General Eric M. Smith’s office told Real Raw News.
The arrest occurred Saturday night at Hooks’ home in Arlington, Virginia, not far from FEMA’s D.C. headquarters. The Marines cuffed Hooks while he was sleeping, showed him a military arrest warrant listing the charges against him, and carted him off to a holding center for processing.
A central piece of evidence, our source said, is a typewritten memo bearing Hooks and Criswell’s signatures. In it, the text encourages FEMA supervisors in Maui to either incinerate or discreetly bury the dead. The memo’s sinister language—“entomb them deep”—is emblematic of FEMA’s wanton disregard for human life.
Although no part of the letter specifically tells FEMA in Maui to execute civilians, Marines on the scene have reportedly found 250 bullet-filled corpses whose wounds are consistent with small arms used by FEMA and the FBI.
Our source said mass grave sites near Lahaina prove that FEMA personnel were following Hooks and Criswell’s instructions. As reported Saturday, Marines caught FEMA operatives piling corpses into a mass gravesite at the Maui Forest Reserve.
More disturbing, the letter was dated August 5, three days before the August 8 fires began, meaning FEMA is either clairvoyant or had foreknowledge of a premeditated crime.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_307939,"Investigators from the U.S. Army’s Criminal Investigation Division (CID) on Tuesday arrested Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen at a Maryland hotel, alleging that the Deep State despot had engineered a diabolical scheme that clandestinely sent hundreds of billions of American tax dollars to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, far more than the $75bn the criminal Biden Regime has admitted to giving its felonious collaborator in Ukraine.
A source at CID’s Fort Liberty, NC, field office told Real Raw News that investigators apprehended Yellen and an unnamed associate outside the Merriweather Lakehouse Hotel in Baltimore at approximately 9:30 p.m. Yellen was shown a military arrest warrant charging her with treason and defrauding the United States of America before being shuttled to a processing center for interrogation.
He said Yellen seemed bewildered at the news and did not try to flee or resist. The associate, identified as Yellen’s chauffeur and bodyguard, was jailed as an accessory to Yellen’s crimes.
The White Hats’ investigation into Yellen’s criminality began in October 2022, when Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis Shannon Corless voluntarily surrendered to JAG personnel in Pensacola, Fl, claiming she had helped Yellen conceal financial transactions whereby they unlawfully redistributed tens of millions of Treasury Department dollars to radical left organizations such as ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter. At the time, Corless offered JAG an SD card allegedly holding proof of her claims and potentially more incriminating evidence against Yellen. She said she was unable to access several password-protected files.
The data in those files, JAG would later discover, implicated Yellen in financial crimes that exponentially surpassed the millions of dollars threshold. According to our source, Yellen used handsomely paid minions to funnel Zelenskyy cash while obfuscating her own lawbreaking.
“There are smoking guns there,” our source said. “We can now prove the administration gave Ukraine $50bn four months before Vladimir Putin launched his Special Military Operation in Ukraine, for example. There is no public mention of these disbursements. Each transaction has the same common denominator—Yellen and Treasury. It has taken a long time to catch this one. There’s a few reasons this country has gone bankrupt, and she’s one of them.”
He said Yellen was among the horde of Deep Staters to flee the United States once the regime’s despots suspected their names appeared on sealed indictments, and learned that their avaricious allies were being charged with, convicted of, and executed for high treason.
Fearing arrest, Yellen left the U.S. for Eastern Europe in early November, and the timing somewhat coincided with Corless handing JAG the SD card. Our source said Yellen had made several brief trips back to the U.S. between then and May, but White Hats hadn’t received word until after the fact.
“September 5, we learned that Biden recalled her to the States. I can’t detail how we found out or how we pinpointed her or why she was at a hotel instead of her house—but there are reasons for all of that. We had her under surveillance in Maryland for a week. She’ll be interrogated, and JAG will decide where she goes. Wherever that is, it’s good riddance,” our source said."

(75.4%) believe that the deterrence of the Palestinian Resistance has increased.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_251484,"American Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who served as managing editor of Reuters from 2011 to 2016, Paul Ingrassia, has reignited the fiery debate over what it means to be a “natural born citizen” under the U.S. Constitution—a debate with significant implications for potential presidential candidate Nikki Haley.

Published on American Greatness, Mr. Ingrassia, a Law Clerk, a two-time Claremont Fellow, and a member of President Trump’s National Economic Council, meticulously examined the constitutional provision that has been at the heart of eligibility controversies involving political figures from John McCain to Kamala Harris.

At the core of his argument is Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, which Ingrassia insists unambiguously mandates that only “natural born citizens” of the United States are eligible to assume the presidency.

Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 states, “No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.”

The distinction between “natural born citizen” and “birthright citizenship” is central to Ingrassia’s analysis. The former term, he reminds us, is expressly reserved for those born on American soil to U.S. citizen parents, a requirement not emulated for other federal offices. This stringent criterion traces back to the Founding Fathers’ fears of foreign influence at the highest level of government.

The debate isn’t new. Presidential campaigns of John McCain (R), Barack Obama (D), Ted Cruz (R), and Kamala Harris (D) have all faced scrutiny under this clause.

Legal scholars continue to explore this terrain, with some, like Lawrence Solum, suggesting that being born in the U.S. to citizen parents suffices for being considered a natural-born citizen.

John Eastman’s arguments regarding Kamala Harris further highlight the complexity of this issue, proposing that the status of one’s parents at birth is crucial in determining eligibility.

In Nikki Haley’s situation, reports indicate that her parents were not U.S. citizens at the time of her birth in 1972. This fact, according to the Constitution’s standards as interpreted by Ingrassia, disqualifies her from presidential or vice-presidential candidacy under the Twelfth Amendment.

Ingrassia highlights that although she may claim citizenship by birthplace, this does not satisfy the ‘natural-born’ requirement as enforced by the Constitution.

The discussion, Ingrassia notes, diverges from the precedent of Wong Kim Ark, where the Supreme Court addressed birthright citizenship but did not conflate this with the specific breed of natural-born citizenship needed for presidential eligibility.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_593118,"With considerably lower efficacy rates, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines cause more deaths than save lives, according to a new study whose researchers called for a “global moratorium” on the shots and “immediate removal” from childhood immunization schedule.

The peer-reviewed study, published in the Cureus journal on Jan. 24, analyzed reports from the initial phase 3 trials of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. It was these trials that led to the shots being approved under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States. The study also looked into several other research and reviews of the trials. It found that the vaccines had “dramatically lower” efficacy rates than the vaccine companies claimed.
Moreover, based on “conservative assumptions, the estimated harms of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines greatly outweigh the rewards: for every life saved, there were nearly 14 times more deaths caused by the modified mRNA injections.”

“Given the well-documented SAEs (serious adverse events) and unacceptable harm-to-reward ratio, we urge governments to endorse and enforce a global moratorium on these modified mRNA products until all relevant questions pertaining to causality, residual DNA, and aberrant protein production are answered.”

The authors also recommended an “immediate removal” of the COVID-19 vaccines from the childhood immunization schedule. They pointed out that children were at very low risk from the infection.

“It is unethical and unconscionable to administer an experimental vaccine to a child who has a near-zero risk of dying from COVID-19 but a well-established 2.2 percent risk of permanent heart damage based on the best prospective data available.”
Very Low Efficacy Rate
Following the first trials of Pfizer and Moderna, it was claimed that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines had a 95 percent reduction of symptomatic COVID-19. The study pointed out that this efficacy assumption was false.

Pfizer’s claim was based on the fact that only eight out of 22,000 vaccine recipients contracted COVID-19 during the trial compared to 162 out of 22,000 people in the placebo group. In total, 170 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in both groups.

However, the researchers pointed out that a large number of infections fell under the “suspected” COVID-19 category, which was ignored. A total of 3,410 such suspected cases were identified in the trial, which is 20 times the 170 confirmed cases.

“There were 1,594 such cases in the vaccinated group and 1,816 in the placebo. When factoring in both confirmed and suspected cases, vaccine efficacy against developing symptoms drops to only 19 percent, far below the 50 percent RR (relative risk) reduction threshold required for regulatory authorization,” the study said.

“Thus, when considering both confirmed and suspected cases, vaccine efficacy appears to have been dramatically lower than the official 95 percent claim.”

The study’s authors declared no financial support from any organization for their work. A few conflict of interest disclosures were made.

One author received a grant from Quanta Computer Inc. Another author, cardiologist Peter A. McCullough, declared employment and owning stock/stock options in The Wellness Company. A third author is the founder of the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation (VSRF).
Lives Saved Versus Deaths
Researchers criticized the Pfizer and Moderna trial reports for “exclusive focus” on relative risk or RR measure while omitting absolute risk reduction. They argued that absolute risk reduction “gives a better indication of a drug’s clinical utility.”
“Both types of risk estimation are required to avoid reporting bias and to provide a more comprehensive perspective on vaccine efficacy. Omitting the absolute risk statistics leads to overestimation of the clinical benefits of the vaccines.”

In contrast with the 95 percent efficacy rate using the RR measure, absolute risk reduction for Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were 0.7 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, the study stated.

“An absolute risk reduction of approximately 1 percent for the COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations meant that a substantial number of individuals would need to be injected in order to prevent a single mild-to-moderate case of COVID-19.”

To prevent one case of COVID-19 infection, 142 individuals would need to be vaccinated with Pfizer’s shot, the study said. When it came to Moderna, 88 people had to be injected.

Taking into account these numbers as well as the infection fatality rates of COVID-19, the researchers concluded that roughly 52,000 people would need to be vaccinated to prevent one COVID-19-related death.

This would mean two lives saved for roughly 100,000 injections of the Pfizer vaccine. However, there is a risk of 27 deaths per 100,000 doses of Pfizer shot, the researchers calculated. As such, for every life saved by the jab, almost 14 lives would be lost due to the mRNA vaccine, the study stated.

Authors noted that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) “did not include absolute risk reduction measures” when reviewing vaccine data.

This action deviated from FDA guidelines “which state that both approaches are crucial in order to avoid the misguided use of pharmaceuticals.”
Serious Adverse Events
Researchers cited a September 2022 analysis to detail the pervasiveness of serious adverse effects (SAE) among the vaccinated group in the trials. The analysis looked at both Pfizer and Moderna trial data, discovering roughly 125 SAEs per 100,000 vaccine recipients. This indicated one SAE per 800 vaccines.
“The Pfizer trial exhibited a 36 percent higher risk of serious adverse events in the vaccine group (compared to placebo) … The Moderna trial exhibited a 6 percent higher risk of serious adverse events in the vaccine group,” the analysis stated.

“These findings stand in sharp contrast with the FDA’s initial claim that SAEs reported by the two pivotal trials were ‘balanced between treatment groups,’” researchers from the Jan. 24 study noted.

This discrepancy could be because the FDA only counted the number of individuals with serious adverse events rather than the total SAEs experienced by the trial subjects, they said.

Since a single person can have multiple SAEs, counting only individuals would produce a lower number than the total number of such adverse events.

“When the SAEs were viewed collectively, the risks in the vaccine group were substantially elevated beyond those previously determined by the FDA,” the researchers wrote.

The analysis found that the excess risk of serious adverse events of special interest (AESI) among the placebo group was 10.1 per 10,000 individuals. However, the risk reduction for COVID-19 hospitalization in this group was only 2.3 per 10,000 people.

This meant that the subjects were at over four times the risk of suffering AESIs after getting vaccinated than they were of getting hospitalized from the infection. In the Moderna trial, subjects were more than two times at risk of experiencing AESI than being hospitalized.

“To put these findings in perspective, the official SAE rate for other vaccines is only 1-2 per million,” the Jan. 24 study said. The 2020 analysis’ “estimate based on the Pfizer trial data (1,250 SAEs per million) exceeds this benchmark by at least 600-fold.”
Rushed Vaccines
In the Jan. 24 study, researchers noted that the safety of mRNA products was “never assessed” in a manner consistent with scientific standards for vaccines or for gene therapy products (GPT), which they claim is “the more accurate classification” for these jabs. “Many key trial findings were either misreported or omitted entirely from published reports.”
The usual safety testing protocols and toxicology requirements were bypassed by the FDA and vaccine manufacturers. As the two trials were terminated prematurely, there was never an “unbiased assessment” of potential serious adverse events.

“It was only after the EUA that the serious biological consequences of rushing the trials became evident, with numerous cardiovascular, neurological, reproductive, hematological, malignant, and autoimmune SAEs identified and published in the peer-reviewed medical literature.”

In addition, the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines produced and evaluated in the trials were not the same ones that were manufactured and administered to people around the world. The global vaccination campaign used a vaccine produced by a different process, which has been shown to have “varying degrees of DNA contamination.”

The researchers pointed out that several excess deaths, cardiac events, strokes, and other serious adverse events have wrongly been ascribed to COVID-19 rather than the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines since early 2021.

Injuries from these vaccines overlap with both post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) and severe acute COVID-19 illness, which end up often obscuring the vaccine’s contribution to such conditions. “Multiple booster injections appear to cause immune dysfunction, thereby paradoxically contributing to heightened susceptibility to COVID-19 infections with successive doses.”

For the “vast majority” of adults below 50 years of age, the perceived benefits of the mRNA vaccines were dwarfed by their “potential disabling and life-threatening harm.” The study said older adults may be at higher risk of such harm.
CDC and FDA Criticized
Commenting on the study, Mat Staver, the founder and chairman of nonprofit Liberty Counsel, said that in the paper, scientists “confirm what sound scientific research has been showing for years, that these shots have never been safe nor effective.”
“The FDA and the CDC are supposed to protect the people, but they have become the lapdog of the pharmaceutical industry. This must change.”

The CDC is currently under scrutiny for suppressing an alert for myocarditis from COVID-19 vaccination. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle called the myocardium.
A document recently obtained by The Epoch Times shows that in May 2021, the CDC had prepared a draft alert for myocarditis related to the jabs.

The agency was supposed to send the alert to federal, state, and local public health officials and doctors nationwide through its Health Alert Network (HAN). However, the alert was never sent as some officials were worried about appearing “alarmist.”

The Epoch Times reached out to the agencies for comment."

Politifact_Pants on Fire_News and blog_493442,"(Fox) - In an Exclusive Interview, Reba McEntire, American most successful country music singer reveals that the show will be ending after her latest business sparks tension with Martha MacCallum.

Reba McEntire, American most successful country music singer, made headlines revealing her new CBD line on Live TV. The episode has been searched and watched nationwide in the past couple of days. Martha MacCallum was outraged saying she will be filing a lawsuit against Reba McEntire and Fox for violating the contract and sponsors no longer support the business because of this. Reba McEntire responded with this: “

I knew this would happen before Martha really came after me but I'm not giving in to 'Cancel Culture. When I started this whole thing back in 2018, it really was just a part time passion project and a way for me to give back. After being given so much, I figured there was no better time to make Makers CBD Gummies available to everyone, as it can help thousands of people experience life pain-free and live lives much happier.”

Her product, Makers CBD Gummies, has been flying off the shelves within minutes and Reba McEntire says right now her struggle is to be able to keep up with demand. Her CBD wellness line is 90% cheaper and five times more effective than those being offered by Bayer and other “Big Pharma” companies.

Martha MacCallum was furious after seeing multiple sponsors cease sponsorship and starting to sue Fox News Network. Martha is now calling for Reba McEntire to be indicted, saying: “I am happy Reba McEntire found something to replace prescriptions, but her announcement was a direct breach of contract. Fox News should fire her immediately and she should formally apologize.“

Reba McEntire appeared on Live TV again the next day, not to apologize, but to offer viewers discounted samples.

“I’m not going to let Martha MacCallum intimidate me - and I'll make sure she won't get her own way”, Reba McEntire fired back during her appearance. “My product, Makers CBD Gummies, has helped me and my family get rid of pain that's bothering us for years and we all couldn't believe after years of trying our lives really come back to normal and thrive again! I definitely have faith in it so here I am, offering discount of my product to everyone. Makers CBD Gummies is the product of thousands of hours of research and development. I wouldn’t talk about something on air I don’t believe in and give it to my family.”

Reba McEntire eventually admitted that although Martha MacCallum is enraged, other Fox hosts has been supportive of her. Tucker Carlson even went on Live TV to say that: ""Makers CBD Gummies has completely changed my life and MacCallum is suspected of plotting something""

“Users of Makers CBD Gummies are experiencing results that before now were only possible through prescription medication. It’s obviously a much cheaper, and safer alternative and because of that pharmaceutical companies are finding it harder to keep patients using their prescriptions.”

Online reports of amazing results got us curious about Makers CBD Gummies so we did some research — here’s what we found.

Apparently Reba McEntire has invented a new Makers CBD Gummies formula that can reverse Dementia instantly & for good.

While there are a number of ""supplements"" on the market that are claiming to reverse Dementia, Reba McEntire has created the first reuptake inhibitor (RI), making it more effective at permanently memory-enhancing.

Myriam Bourla – the wife of Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla – has died from complications from the COVID-19 vaccine early Wednesday, according to her doctor. She passed away in the emergency room at New York-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital after being brought in by paramedics. The cause of death has been listed as complications from the Pfizer vaccine.
Myriam Bourla lived in the New York suburb of Scarsdale with her husband. Like many others, Bourla expressed skepticism with her husband’s experimental injection, originally refusing to take it. During an interview with Scarsdale 10583, Bourla stated that while she was “proud” of the work her husband did, she initially refused to take the vaccine, stating it was “not her turn, yet.”
“I just want to communicate that I’m very proud for my husband and the work he has done. I’m also very happy for the humanity and the hope that the vaccine brought to the world. I haven’t had the vaccine yet because is not my turn, yet.”
Many correctly pointed out that this statement demonstrated Bourla’s skepticism towards a vaccine that many believe wasn’t fully tested.
Legal trouble for Pfizer
Albert Bourla has been having a bad week, claiming on Tuesday that people that spread misinformation on vaccines are “criminals.” Critics were quick to point out how Pfizer was previously fined $2.3 billion for illegal marketing in an off-label drug case. One person asked, “didn’t Pfizer pay the largest fine in Big Pharma history for bribing doctors?”

In addition, Pfizer is being accused of lying to the public after a whistleblower raised questions around “data integrity and regulatory oversight” during Pfizer’s “vaccine” trials.

There have been rumors that Pfizer’s CEO was arrested on the weekend. While this claim was quickly shot down by “fact checkers,” it continues to circulate on social media and on blogs. In a video posted by Dark Outpost, host David Zublick states he believes the rumors to be true.

We bought a temporary delay on Wednesday, December 4, when, after hearing vociferous testimony in opposition, the San Antonio Historic Design and Review Commission reversed themselves and voted 8 to 3 against granting the Building Permit for the removal of the Alamo Cenotaph. This result (largely due to our Lawsuit) was totally unprecedented and well nigh miraculous—the first time we have ever been successful in getting a State or City bureaucracy to reverse course and vote against the Bush Reimagine Plan. The first time we’ve drawn blood. There is to be another hearing by this Commission in two weeks. You can be certain that the members of the Commission will receive tremendous pressure from the Council Members who appointed them to support the building permit this time. More on this later.
However, during that hearing, it was revealed that not only do George P. Bush and the GLO intend on moving the Cenotaph outside the boundaries of the Alamo; they also intend to erect a statue of the dictator Santa Anna and a memorial honoring the Mexican Army! I am not making this up. We know that parts of the Bush plan were going to be horrendous, but it now looks like it will be worse than we ever dreamed.
Please redouble your efforts to assist with the lawsuit. That is the only way that this travesty will be permanently stopped. In all frankness I must tell you that up to now right at 200 people have carried the entire financial burden of this fight—almost exactly the size of the original Alamo garrison. That is outrageous. Where are the thousands of the rest of you who claim that you care and yet have not contributed one thin dime? Make no mistake, we will continue this struggle to the very end—with or without you.
We were always incredulous that the people of Texas could have let so few be the only ones to try and defend the Alamo in 1836. Well, it appears that history really does repeat itself. Just please do not have the gall to ever call yourselves Texans again if you continue to do nothing. If you continue to just stand by and watch George P. Bush desecrate the Alamo.
However if you truly do care, we need you to join the army NOW. And that means send ammunition for the Battle in whatever amount. Waging war costs money, AND THIS IS WAR.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_Social media_447290,"Apparently the White House referred to Christmas Trees as Holiday Trees for the first time this year, which prompted CBS presenter, Ben Stein, to present this piece which I would like to share with you.
 The following was written by Ben Stein and recited by him on CBS Sunday Morning Commentary.
 My confession:
 I am a Jew, and every single one of my ancestors was Jewish. And it does not bother me even a little bit when people call those beautiful lit up, bejewelled trees, Christmas trees. I don't feel threatened. I don't feel discriminated against. That's what they are, Christmas trees.
 It doesn't bother me a bit when people say, 'Merry Christmas' to me. I don't think they are slighting me or getting ready to put me in a ghetto. In fact, I kind of like it. It shows that we are all brothers and sisters celebrating this happy time of year. It doesn't bother me at all that there is a manger scene on display at a key intersection near my beach house in Malibu. If people want a nativity scene, it's just as fine with me as is the Menorah a few hundred yards away.
 I don't like getting pushed around for being a Jew, and I don't think Christians like getting pushed around for being Christians. I think people who believe in God are sick and tired of getting pushed around, period. I have no idea where the concept came from, that America is an explicitly atheist country. I can't find it in the Constitution and I don't like it being shoved down my throat.
 Or maybe I can put it another way: where did the idea come from that we should worship celebrities and we aren't allowed to worship God? I guess that's a sign that I'm getting old, too. But there are a lot of us who are wondering where these celebrities came from and where the America we knew went to.
 In light of the many jokes we send to one another for a laugh, this is a little different: This is not intended to be a joke; it's not funny, it's intended to get you thinking.
 Billy Graham's daughter was interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her 'How could God let something like this happen?' (regarding Hurricane Katrina). Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response. She said, 'I believe God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we've been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives.And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out. How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone?'
 In light of recent events... terrorist attacks, school shootings, etc. I think it started when Madeleine Murray O'Hare (she was murdered, her body found a few years ago) complained she didn't want prayer in our schools, and we said OK. Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school. The Bible says thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbor as yourself. And we said OK.
 Then Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn't spank our children when they misbehave, because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem (Dr. Spock's son committed suicide). We said an expert should know what he's talking about. And we said okay.
 Now we're asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don't know right from wrong, and why it doesn't bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves.
 Probably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out. I think it has a great deal to do with 'WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.'
 Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell.
 Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says. 
 Funny how you can send 'jokes' through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing. 
 Funny how lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and workplace.
 Are you laughing yet?
 Funny how when you forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it.
 Funny how we can be more worried about what other people think of us than what God thinks of us.
 Pass it on if you think it has merit.
 If not, then just discard it.... no one will know you did. But, if you discard this thought process, don't sit back and complain about what a bad shape the world is in.
 My Best Regards, Honestly and respectfully,
 Ben Stein"

Politifact_Pants on Fire_Social media_575751,"Many have asked about CIC DJT’s recent Truths about being arrested. 
He’s been dropping a lot of Codes in his Truths lately with misspelled words (codes) that paint a clear picture... when you know Laws and Orders in place to this Operation. 
The most recent is about the ""Former President"" being arrested. 
He's not a former President according to Federal and Military Laws and Orders.
Everything CIC Trump has said has come to fruition... everything.
A buddy of mine asked me this week... ""just how many Americans do you think can or would understand Code?""
As to my reply... “it doesn't really matter if they can or can't, will or won't...” 
There's always Guardians of Freedom who know more than others and take action whether they care or appreciate it or not. 
It's always been this way in America.
Only 1.7% a year fought in the Revolutionary War... but the other 98.3% sure wanted to benefit from their sacrifices and 👉🏻 did and STILL do.
75% of Americans cannot simply name the 3 Branches of Government... So, they definitely cannot dispute Laws and Orders. Laws are revised or revoked. Orders are rescinded or accomplished. 
CIC DJT is not only not a Former, he's current sitting CIC via:
Article II of the Constitution
First War Powers Act
Second War Powers Act
In March 2020, he also said, ""different war, same scenario"" as WWII. 
He said we're fighting an 'invisible enemy'. 
Different War = Invisible Enemy. 
Same Scenario = Laws and Orders. 
In March 2020, CIC DJT was asked by CNN, Fox, NBC, etc. was he a Wartime President? ""Yes, I believe I am.""
CIC DJT became a Wartime President in March 2020 with his DIRECT order to Federalize the National Guard to Active-Duty. 
The only person who can Federalize the NG to Active-Duty is the President via 10 US Code 12406. 
Not only did he do so verbally, he put this Direct Order in Executive Order 13912 found in 10 US Code 1209. 
The Federal Continuity Directives 1 and 2 very vividly outline we are in a Continuity of Government issued on January 17, 2017, and June 13, 2017, with Operational dates of 2018-2022 and 2020-2024. 
It just so happens that EO 13912 was extended to 2024 by ""Biden"" who's a Commonwealth Act 671, World War II History repeat, via the Continuity of Government. 
Not only did the EO 13912 make DJT the acting CIC... in EO 13919, he gave the Secretary of Defense equal authority (normally under him) to Federalize the National Guard to Active-Duty. 
The National Guard have been out of their state jurisdictions and the country every single day since that direct order which is all the proof in the world that this Operation is ongoing, but backs all the Laws and Orders above proving DJT is acting CIC.
EO 13912 is active until 2024; EO 13919 hasn’t been revised or revoked, still active, with no deadline.
EO 13848 proves everything was a plan. It proves J6 was rigged. This EO was written 2 months before ANY election under DJT and 2 years before the Presidential Election of 2020. Meaning the only evidence of Election Fraud was 2016 Elections and prior. 
This proves CIC DJT was a Military Plug from the start. How else would he have known to write such a powerful EO before anything from 2018 to present day? 
Therefore he's not the ""Former"" President in more than one way. 
Obama is the most recent Former 🤭

Politifact_Pants on Fire_Social media_59314,"11 YEAR-OLD WHO SHOT ILLEGALS 
A Shotgun-armed Preteen vs. Illegal Alien Home Invaders ..... Two illegal aliens, Ralphel Resindez, 23, and Enrico Garza, 26, probably believed they would easily overpower home-alone 11-year-old Patricia Harrington after her father had left their two-story home. It seems these crooks never learned two things:
1. They were in Montana.
2. Patricia had been a clay shooting champion since she was nine.
Patricia was in her upstairs room when the two men broke through the front door of the house. She quickly ran to her father's room and grabbed his 12-gauge Mossberg 500 shotgun.
Resindez was the first to get up to the second floor, only to be the first to catch a near point blank blast of buckshot from the 11-year-old's knee-crouch aim. He suffered fatal wounds to his abdomen and genitals.
When Garza ran to the foot of the stairs, he took a blast to the left shoulder and staggered out into the street where he bled to death before medical help could arrive.
It was found out later that Resindez was armed with a stolen 45-caliber handgun he took during another home invasion robbery. That victim, 50-year-old David 0'Burien, was not so lucky. He died from stab wounds to the chest.
Ever wonder why good stuff never makes NBC, CBS, PBS, MSNBC, CNN, or ABC news?
An 11-year-old girl, properly trained, defended her home, and herself against two murderous, illegal immigrants and she wins.
She is still alive. Now THAT is Gun Control!
Thought for the day: Calling an illegal alien an undocumented immigrant' is like calling a drug dealer an 'unlicensed pharmacist.'

""You just pass a law that says that anytime there is a deficit of more than 3% of GDP, all sitting members of Congress are ineligible for re-election. The 26th amendment (granting the right to vote for 18 year-olds) took only 3 months & 8 days to be ratified! Why? Simple! The people demanded it. That was in 1971...before computers, e-mail, cell phones, etc. Of the 27 amendments to the Constitution, seven (7) took 1 year or less to become the law of the land...all because of public pressure.

Warren Buffet is asking each addressee to forward this email to a minimum of twenty people on their address list; in turn ask each of those to do likewise. In three days, most people in The United States of America will have the message. This is one idea that really should be passed around.

*Congressional Reform Act of 2019*

1. No Tenure / No Pension. A Congressman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they are out of office.

2. Congress (past, present & future) participates in Social Security. All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to the Social Security system immediately. All future funds flow into the Social Security system, and Congress participates with the American people. It may not be used for any other purpose.

3. Congress can purchase their own retirement plan, just as all Americans do.

4. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise. Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%.

5. Congress loses their current health care system and participates in the same health care system as the American people.

6. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people.

7. All contracts with past and present Congressmen are void effective 7/1/19. The American people did not make this contract with Congressmen. Congressmen made all these contracts for themselves. Serving in Congress is an honor, not a career. The Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators, so ours should serve their term's), then go home and back to work.

If each person contacts a minimum of twenty people then it will only take three days for most people (in the U.S.) to receive the message. Maybe it is time.

Congress must purchase their own retirement plan, just as ALL Americans do. 4. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise. Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%. 5. Congress loses their current health care system and participates in the same health care system as the American people. 6. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people (i.e. NO MORE INSIDER TRADING!!!). 7. All contracts with past and present Congressmen/women are void. The American people did not make this contract with Congressmen/women. Congress made all these contracts by and for themselves. Serving in Congress is an honor and privilege NOT a career. The Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators should serve their term(s), then go home and go back to work … not get all kinds of freebies. NO WONDER THEY’RE FIGHTING EVERYTHING HE TRIES!

Going back to the times of the Cold War and then in World War II with cloud-seeding, the development of weather modification and mass geo-engineering programs is no longer even covert, with numerous papers, programs and weather engineering patents now made public yet the average person pays no attention to the sky and when you raise the point of this issue they envision the tin hat immediately.
The geo engineering programmes are impacting the air we breathe by deploying heavy metals like aliminum, barium and strontium into our skies. The assault on our atmosphere and agriculture is catastrophically impacting us and it’s a silent war on all of us that only the conscious minds can visualise as we have done our due dilligence and research.

Politifact_Pants on Fire_Social media_205579,"Are the Military and Trump in control?
I just got off the phone with a high up and trusted, military source I know. He comfirmed a few things for me.
Regarding, the speculation/confusion as to whether President Trump signed the Insurrection Act or not,he did. He signed it on Jan 14 th , 2021. The act of signing it immediately gave him 2 more months as President according to the very directives of the Act itself. I was then told that the military gave him 2 more months as President. The second extension was over on May 20 th and most likely extended again by the military who is now in control per the signed Insurrection Act.
Now, with Manhattan Attorney Cy Vance convening a Grand Jury against President Trump, regarding his taxes and business practices, the Trump witch hunt continues. The only problem they may have is that they cannot arrest a sitting President and I am assured that he still is President. Once again, the liberal,
legal crazies are desperately trying all they can to stop Trump.
It was confirmed today that many Generals approached Trump to run for office to take out the deep state, criminal cabal. They have been making arrests since the Biden – fake inauguration. 
The military support is all around Trump and continues under the Insurrection Act.
I was told that the military goes through the FISA court and already did their own investigation, determining that there was international and domestic voter fraud They have long known the real election and voting numbers and have acted accordingly.
Our military is bound by the constitution, their duty and the signed insurrection act to be in control, do what they have to do, make arrests and make things right. They are supporting a new election in August and the return of President Trump . I am told he will be returning very soon.
My source shared much more with me that gave me real hope that justice was unfolding in a big way and the truth would soon come out in spite of the sellout media and ego-laden politicians.
Hold on to your hat. Pray for President Trump and our military as the truth really comes out.

Are you paying attention? It was at Cornell that Bill Gates designed the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) and patened it under US2006257852. Are you awake yet? Now let's really go down the rabbit hole. Moderna was a pharmaceutical company that started in Germany under the name IG Farben. IG Farben is infamous for it's mass production of Zyklon-B, the primary gas used to kill millions during the Holocaust. After Germany fell, IG Farben was dissolved and its assets sold off by a Nazi turned American by the name of, you guessed it, George Soros. Soros rebranded the company as Moderna. And who was the primary stockholder of Moderna until his death? Jeffrey Epstein. His role in Moderna is where he made his fortune and established his connections. Let that sink in.

When the wing was created some six years ago, this type of real-time intelligence was a pipe-dream to Afghanistan’s nascent national security forces.

The PC-12 aircraft has full motion video capability and can vacuum up cell phone transmissions and follow the connection to the other end of the call to find out intelligence on the other party involved.

Watch below (timestamp 2:35) –

Partial transcript:
“…The efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge. It turns out the flu vaccine isn’t that effective in elderly people. Most of the benefit comes from younger people not spreading it because they’re vaccinated, and that benefits, on a community basis, the elderly.
“Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that. And doing that so you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects. If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that’s way more, 700,000 people who will suffer from that.
“So, really understanding the safety at gigantic scales across all age ranges – you know pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities – it’s very, very hard, and that actual decision of ‘okay, let’s go and give this vaccine to the entire world,’ governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.”

🚧🤯⛽️🛢🇺🇸💵🚗🚛🛻💨🛑🚦
Written by BP Oil Executive
Brice Cromwell.
This explains it all:
I’ve been in oil and gas for a decade and sometimes forget how the average person may not know what I see everyday. 
We, the American people, have enough oil and gas under our feet to supply our demand and also export our products for years to come.
No matter your political opinion, we can all agree the gas prices we see now are upsetting. 
What everyone needs to understand is that the high gas prices are not because of some conflict overseas - prices were high well before that. The prices are not high because our American supply simply vanished. 
The prices are high because the people who run our country have decided to import oil from another country instead of using our very own American made product. 
Why? 
Using our own product creates lower prices, puts hard working American people to work with very good paying jobs and makes us as a country energy independent - Not dependent on another country to survive. 
We all saw that not long ago. 
Not only have the people in power decided to kill American jobs and create high prices, but they’ve also passed legislation to make it harder for an American oil and gas company to produce & transport  our very own product.
Why? 
Forget for one second who was President when our prices at the pump were low and our economy was booming and realize that that person was simply “For the people”. If you take away your dislike for DJT, you’ll admit that you miss those times and enjoyed them. Your 401K was higher, gas prices were lower and we were booming as a country. 
Now after a year of our current admin, you’ll realize that these people are “not for the people”. They are for themselves and their foreign business deals.
The high gas prices should be enough for you to see that. 
The supply is still here, the hard-working Americans to produce it are still here. 
Having a booming economy is still possible. 
So no matter what you’re told by the news, realize that if we had people in power who were for us Americans, it could be as good it was before. 
Nothing has changed as far as oil and gas from 2016-2020 to the last year. 
It didn’t just dry up. 
It’s here, we are here to produce it. 
We can go back to lower prices at the pump.
All we need is the people in power to want that. 
Lastly, since we all got to witness someone running our country for four years who truly wanted the best “for the people” as we can clearly see the “then & now” comparison as we speak. Remember every media outlet and political person wanted you to hate him, wanted to impeach him and did everything they could do be against him. 
They were against the man who wanted things to be good for US, the American people.
Those same people are not against the current leadership. 
Makes you wonder who’s side they’re all on….

Now listen to what she has to say...
""I'm not saying that stealing is okay,"" Meza explained. ""All I'm saying is that it doesn't warrant a death penalty. Thieves only carry weapons for self-protection and to provide the householder an incentive to cooperate. They just want to get their loot and get away. When the resident tries to resist is when people get hurt. If only one side is armed fewer people will be killed.""
Meza was quick to reassure that her bill ""would not totally prevent homeowners from defending themselves.
Under the new law the homeowner's obligation is to flee the home at the first sign of intrusion. If fleeing is not possible he must cooperate with the intruder. But if violence breaks out it is the homeowner's responsibility to make sure no one gets hurt. The best way to achieve this is to use the minimum non-lethal force possible because intruders will be able to sue for any injuries they receive at the hands of the homeowner.""
""In most instances the thief needs the money more than the homeowner does,"" Meza reasoned. ""The homeowner's insurance we reimburse his losses. On balance, the transfer of property is likely to lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth. If my bill can help make this transfer a peaceful one so much the better."""

The story in question claimed the following events occurred:

“You’re all a bunch of a**holes! You need to be voted out since you don’t give two sh*ts about the American people! Their lives are on your hands. You’re a bunch of knuckle-dragging oxygen thieves. In fact, we should charge your for all that oxygen you waste every day, especially you turtle-looking f*ck from Kentucky. Get fu**ed!

Monroe Doctrine:
https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/monroe-doctrine
The Military Justice Act of 2016 clarifies many things… but especially that Military is SEPARATE from anything Civilian. 
When Donald John Trump federalized 1 million National Guard to Active-Duty that was a DIRECT MILITARY ORDER… 
As long as he’s shaving, showering, and sh*tting (Military Jargon), he holds that command. 
Because the Military Justice Act also clarifies President and Commander-in-Chief are separate and also clarifies Commander-in-Chief are separate from Article III which is the Federal Government 🤷🏽‍♂️
Who clarified? 👉🏻 The United States Supreme Court in 2016 before they went under Continuity of Government as this Act was passed in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act 👉🏻 National Essential Function found in the Federal Continuity Directives starting January 17, 2017, to most recent issue April 2023 ALL with CIC Trumps EOs and Acts in them 😎
If Executive Order 13912, the Federalization of the National Guard isn't so important, how come it's been extended to March 2024? 
""Biden"" did not terminate Proclamation 9994 from March 13, 2020, which was followed by the EO 13912, on May 12, 2023, because he is not in power as the 3 Cannons, Military Customs Funeral on January 20, 2021, displayed he was not Inaugurated, CIC Trump received the 4 Cannons / 21 Guns which is a 21 Gun Salute = Presidential Inauguration.
It's also CIC Trump's EO 13818 that pairs with the December 2016 Global Magnitsky Act that declared WAR on all Human Rights Abuse = Drug Trafficking, Human Trafficking, Sex Trafficking, and Child Trafficking, along with protection of whistleblowers and those being hazed for exposing these evil people. 
Once you understand the importance of the Military Justice Act plus the timeline of these Laws and Orders... you'll understand you're watching the greatest Sting Operation in World History take place and they're providing nuggets via visuals. 
The same Title 10 that CIC Trump federalized the 1 million to Active-Duty which is active until March 2024, is the same Title 10 that every single Veteran alive and passed plus all in Active-Duty, National Guard, and Reserve components swore in under. You cannot believe in one without the other. 
The same with Military Customs... 4 Cannons with 21 Guns (Rounds fired) = 21 Gun Salute. 3 Cannons with 21 Guns does not equal a 21 Gun Salute, it's a Funeral Service. Arlington Cemetery dot MIL specifically points this out. 
A little over a month after CIC Trump federalized the NG to Active-Duty, he signed EO 13919... 
And this is where your Optic 101 comes in after ALL of the pictures I post of showing how the National Guard have been out of their State Jurisdictions and U.S. Jurisdiction every single day since those Orders were given... 
CIC Trump passed this in EO 13919:
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 12304 of title 10, United States Code, and having determined that it is necessary to augment the regular Armed Forces of the United States for a named operational mission, specifically the “Enhanced Department of Defense Counternarcotic Operation in the Western Hemisphere,” I hereby order as follows...
WESTERN HEMISPHERE.  
That 10 US Code 12304 specifically says: 
 A member who is ordered to active duty under this section may be required to serve on active duty until his total service on active duty equals 24 months. If his enlistment or other period of military service would expire before he has served the required period under this section, it may be extended until he has served the required period.
10 USC 12304:
https://www.govinfo.gov/.../USCODE-2021-title10-subtitleE...   
-- 
NONE of the Executive Orders that ""Biden"" has extended would benefit he or any of the evil RINOS and DINOS aka the Swamp whatsoever... 
And keep in mind... 
3 Cannons = Funeral Service
21 Guns = Reigning Monarch
Number of Guns:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21-gun_salute
The 21-gun salute is not to be confused with the three-volley salute (or three-rifle volley) rendered at military honors funerals, which you might see or hear at Arlington National Cemetery. 
Arlington:

Politifact_Pants on Fire_Social media_874359,"Autopsies Prove that COVID-19 is a Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (Pulmonary Thrombosis)
It is now clear that the whole world has been attacking the so-called Coronavirus Pandemic wrongly due to a serious pathophysiological diagnosis error.
According to valuable information from Italian pathologists, ventilators and intensive care units were never needed.
Autopsies performed by the Italian pathologists has shown that it is not pneumonia but it is Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (Thrombosis) which ought to be fought with antibiotics, antivirals, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants.
If this is true for all cases, that means the whole world is about to resolve this novel pandemic earlier than expected.
However, protocols are currently being changed in Italy who have been adversely affected by this pandemic.
The impressive case of a Mexican family in the United States who claimed they were cured with a home remedy was documented: three 500 mg aspirins dissolved in lemon juice boiled with honey, taken hot. The next day they woke up as if nothing had happened to them! Well, the scientific information that follows proves they are right!
This information was released by a medical researcher from Italy:
“Thanks to 50 autopsies performed on patients who died of COVID-19, Italian pathologists have discovered that IT IS NOT PNEUMONIA, strictly speaking, because the virus does not only kill pneumocytes of this type, but uses an inflammatory storm to create an endothelial vascular thrombosis.”
In disseminated intravascular coagulation, the lung is the most affected because it is the most inflamed, but there is also a heart attack, stroke and many other thromboembolic diseases.
In fact, the protocols left antiviral therapies useless and focused on anti-inflammatory and anti-clotting therapies. These therapies should be done immediately, even at home, in which the treatment of patients responds very well.
If the Chinese had denounced it, they would have invested in home therapy, not intensive care! So, the way to fight it is with antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants.
An Italian pathologist reports that the hospital in Bergamo did a total of 50 autopsies and one in Milan, 20, that is, the Italian series is the highest in the world, the Chinese did only 3, which seems to fully confirm the information.
In a nutshell, the disease is determined by a disseminated intravascular coagulation triggered by the virus; therefore, it is not pneumonia but pulmonary thrombosis, a major diagnostic error.
Some world leaders doubled the number of resuscitation places in the ICU, with unnecessary exorbitant costs.
According to the Italian pathologist, treatment in ICUs is useless if thromboembolism is not resolved first. “If we ventilate a lung where blood does not circulate, it is useless, in fact, nine (9) patients out of ten (10) will die because the problem is cardiovascular, not respiratory.”
“It is venous microthrombosis, not pneumonia, that determines mortality.”
According to the literature, inflammation induces thrombosis through a complex but well-known pathophysiological mechanism.
Unfortunately, what the scientific literature said, especially Chinese, until mid-March was that anti-inflammatory drugs should not be used.
Now, the therapy being used in Italy is with anti-inflammatories and antibiotics, as in influenza, and the number of hospitalized patients has been reduced.
He also discovered that many deaths, even in their 40s, had a history of fever for 10 to 15 days, which were not treated properly.
The inflammation does a great deal of tissue damage and creates ground for thrombus formation. However, the main problem is not the virus, but the immune hyperreaction that destroys the cell where the virus is installed.
In fact, patients with rheumatoid arthritis have never needed to be admitted to the ICU because they are on corticosteroid therapy, which is a great anti-inflammatory.
With this important discovery, it is possible to return to normal life and open closed deals due to the quarantine, though not immediately, but with time.
