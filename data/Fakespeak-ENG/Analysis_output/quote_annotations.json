The research draws attention to this key distinction as it has led to a significant inflation in COVID fatality totals.

The facilities listed are not affiliated with DCYF and had not signed off on this job listing.\nThe listings have since been taken down to avoid further confusion.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, DCYF began internal recruitment of social service specialists to care for foster children who are either COVID-19 positive or may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the event a placement home was not available.\nTo clarify, those facilities that ultimately open their doors to this effort would only house State-dependent children and youth in out-of-home care who due to being COVID positive or COVID exposed do not currently have a foster home available.

It is critical that we don\u2019t default on our debts, but equally as important that we don\u2019t allow Democrats to spend as much as they want, on whatever they want. We shouldn\u2019t give Democrats a free pass to spend Iowans' money irresponsibly and jeopardize the entire global economy. Democrats should drop their multi-trillion-dollar social spending extravaganza and commit to working with Republicans to put our nation on a sustainable fiscal path that respects taxpayers.\"",

In other words, anomalies are representative of temperature changes over large areas and distances.\n\nWhy do we use temperature anomalies?\n\nAnomalies more accurately describe climate variability over larger areas than absolute temperatures do, and they give a frame of reference that allows more meaningful comparisons between locations and more accurate calculations of temperature trends.\n\nNOAA measurements of temperature anomaly data across the contiguous 48 U. S.

Global Warming Policy Foundation Report 48, London.\n\nLondon, 27 February: A prominent Canadian zoologist says that Facebook\u2019s information is gravely out of date and 2020 was another good year for polar bears.\n\nIn the State of the Polar Bear Report 2020, published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) on International Polar Bear Day, zoologist Dr. Susan Crockford explains that while the climate change narrative insists that polar bear populations are declining due to reduced sea ice, the scientific literature doesn\u2019t support such a conclusion.\n\nCrockford clarifies that the IUCN\u2019s 2015 Red List assessment for polar bears, which Facebook uses as an authority for \u2018fact checking\u2019, is seriously out of date. New and compelling evidence shows bears that in regions with profound summer ice loss are doing well.\n\nIncluded in that evidence are survey results for 8 of the 19 polar bear subpopulations, only two of which showed insignificant declines after very modest ice loss. The rest were either stable or increasing, and some despite major reductions in sea ice. As a result, the global population size is now almost 30,000 \u2013 up from about 26,000 in 2015.\n\nDr. Crockford points out that in 2020, even though summer sea ice declined to the second lowest levels since 1979, there were no reports of widespread starvation of bears, acts of cannibalism, or drowning deaths that might suggest bears were having trouble surviving the ice-free season.\u201d",

Last night I crossed a line that I shouldn\u2019t have and paid the enormous price of my reputation as a renown comedian. Comedy is never about poking fun at or making lite of people with major ordeals happening in their lives. Comedy is about using real life circumstances to create laughter and bring light to an otherwise dark world. With that said, I sincerely apologize to my friend\u2019s Jada Pinkett-Smith, Will Smith, and the rest of the Smith family for the disrespect and disregard I displayed which was unfortunately broadcast for the world to see.

      "text": "\u2018Black & Veatch Special Projects Corp\u2018, which is allegedly \u201ca global engineering, procurement, consulting and construction company specialising in infrastructure development\u201d.\n\nThe contact was awarded on September 20th, 2012 and is described as \u201cProfessional, Scientific, and Technical Services\u201d. Obviously this is very vague and most likely of little interest to anyone who happens to stumble across it. But there is something contained deep within the details that should be of interest to anyone and everyone.\n\nThe \u2018Award History\u2019 for the contract contains a tab for \u2018Sub-Awards\u2019 detailing the recipients, action date, amount, and very brief description for 115 Sub-Award transactions. Most of the Sub-Awards are extremely mundane for things such as \u201claboratory equipment for Kyiv\u201d, or \u201coffice furniture for Kyiv\u201d.\n\nBut there is one Sub-Award that stands out among the rest, and it is was awarded to Labyrinth Global Health INC for \u201cSME Manuscript Documentation and COVID-19 Research\u201d.\n\nAn award for Covid-19 research isn\u2019t exactly shocking when the world is allegedly in the grip of a Covid-19 pandemic, but considering the fact the sub-contract was awarded 12th November 2019, at least one month before the alleged emergence of the novel coronavirus, and three months before it was officially dubbed Covid-19, the award for Covid-19 research should come as a shock to everyone.\n\nBut the shock doesn\u2019t end there, because the place the contact for Covid-19 research was instructed to take place was Ukraine, as was the entire contract awarded by the DOD to Black & Veatch Special Projects Corp.\n\nThe contract details found on the \u2018USA Spending\u2019 site actually reveal that the specific DOD department that awarded the contact was the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). The contract was awarded 20th September 2012, and concluded on 13th October 2020.\n\nWhilst the details are vague, the US Government site also reveals that $21.7 million of the $116.6 million contact was spent on a \u2018Biological threat reduction program in Ukraine\u2019.\n\nWhy did the Department of Defense pay a company that is allegedly \u201ca global engineering, procurement, consulting and construction company specialising in infrastructure development\u201d, to help implement a \u201cBiological threat reduction program in Ukraine\u2019?\n\nAnd why did both the DOD and said company then pay Labyrinth Global Health INC to carry out COVID-19 research in Ukraine at least one month before the alleged emergence of the novel coronavirus, and three months before it was officially dubbed Covid-19?\n\nFounded in 2017, Labyrinth Global Health is allegedly a \u201cwomen-owned small business with deep expertise and a proven track record supporting initiatives for scientific and medical advancement.\u201d\n\nThey describe themselves as \u201ca multicultural and international organization with offices in four countries and a team of experts with diverse backgrounds and competencies, including microbiology, virology, global health, emerging infectious disease nursing, medical anthropology, field epidemiology, clinical research, and health information systems.\u201d\n\nOne of those offices just happens to be located in Kyiv, Ukraine, which the company dubs \u201ca gateway to Eastern Europe\u201d.\n\nThe leadership team of Labyrinth Global consists of Karen Saylors, PHD who is the Chief Executive Officer; Mary Guttieri, PHS who is the Chief Science Officer; and Murat Tartan who is the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nKaren Saylors, PhD, who co-founded Labyrinth Global Health, has allegedly worked in the international public health field for over a decade and has spent many years living in Africa establishing global surveillance networks, \u201cworking with partners to improve Global Health policy on infectious disease detection, response, and control\u201d.\n\nAt Labyrinth, Dr. Saylors specialises in studies that aim to understand and mitigate biological and behavioural risk of disease transmission. Dr. Saylors worked with Oxford University Clinical Trials Network in Vietnam on zoonotic disease surveillance research and continues to coordinate with regional partners on emerging outbreaks in animal and human populations.\n\nBut who are the partners that Dr Karen Saylors and Labyrinth Global Health choose to work with? They are none other than the \u2018Eco Health Alliance\u2019 and \u2018Metabiota\u2019.\n\nDr Karen Saylors, Eco Health Alliance and Metabiota worked together on the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \u2018PREDICT\u2019 program from 2009, while Labyrinth Global Health worked alongside EHA and Metabiota on the PREDICT program from 2017.\n\nLaunched in 2009 and funded by USAID, PREDICT was an early warning system for new and emerging diseases in 21 countries. It was led by the University of California\u2019s (\u201cUC\u201d) Davis One Health Institute and core partners included EcoHealth Alliance (\u201cEHA\u201d), Metabiota, Wildlife Conservation Society, and Smithsonian Institution, and as we\u2019ve just revealed; Labyrinth Global Health. PREDICT was a forerunner of the more ambitious Global Virome Project.\n\nThe USAID describes PREDICT as having made \u201csignificant contributions to strengthening global surveillance and laboratory diagnostic capabilities for both known and newly discovered viruses within several important virus groups, such as filoviruses (including ebolaviruses), influenza viruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses\u201c.\n\nHere\u2019s one of the many studies published by Eco Health Alliance, Metabiota and Labyrinth Global Health proving the connection \u2013\n\nPREDICT partnered with the non-profit Eco Health Alliance (EHA) to carry out its 9-year effort to catalogue hundreds of thousands of biological samples, \u201cincluding over 10,000 bats.\u201d A PREDICT-funded 2015 study on \u201cdiversity of coronavirus in bats\u201d also included Peter Daszak, president of EHA, among its participants.\n\nEco Health Alliance is listed as a partner of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (\u201cWIV\u201d) on archived pages of its website and was mentioned as a one of the institute\u2019s \u201cstrategic partners\u201d by the WIV\u2019s Deputy Director General in 2018.\n\nNotably, the relationship between the WIV and the American Biodefence establishment was advanced by EHA policy advisor, David R. Franz, former commander at US bioweapons lab at Fort Detrick.\n\nWIV\u2019s Dr. Shi Zhengli, a.k.a. \u201cBatwoman,\u201d had also worked with EHA\u2019s Daszak on bat-related studies. As far back as 2005, Daszak and Zhengli were conducting research on SARS-like coronaviruses in bats. Several PREDICT-funded studies on SARS-like coronaviruses and Swine Flu count with both Zhengli\u2019s and Daszak\u2019s contributions. Perhaps the most noteworthy of these is a 2015 PREDICT and NIH-funded study she co-authored entitled: \u2018A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence\u2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Nathan Wolfe is the founder of Metabiota and non-profit Global Viral. He spent over eight years conducting biomedical research in both sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Unsurprisingly, Wolfe is a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader.  More notably, since 2008 he had been a member of DARPA\u2019s DSRC, Defence Science Research Council, until it was disbanded.\n\nAll of these people and organisations have been working for at least the last decade studying coronaviruses and helping to set up Biolabs in Ukraine. All using US Department of Defense funds to do so. You can read much more about this here, here and here.\n\nPutting the biolabs in Ukraine to one side for now, let\u2019s return to the subject of Covid-19. If the US Government was funding Covid-19 research before Covid-19 was publicly known to exist then this suggests they either knew Covid-19 existed naturally, or they were involved in constructing this virus in a lab.\n\nBut if the contract evidence isn\u2019t enough for you to come to this conclusion (it should be), then perhaps coupling it with evidence that the US National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases\u2019",

      "text": "\u201cThe efficacy of the antibodies from clinical trials is woefully low and the circulating half-life of such a therapeutic may be as low as two weeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also worried about allergic reactions in newborns, especially given the high dose of antibodies and especially given that 12 infants died in the experimental arm of the clinical trial.\u201d\n\nDr. Meryl Nass, an internist, biological warfare epidemiologist and member of the CHD scientific advisory committee, cited a CDC study indicating RSV\u2019s low risk for babies.\n\nShe also cited the lack of demonstrated long-term efficacy for such monoclonal antibodies, writing on her Substack:\n\n\u201cThere is already resistance in RSV strains to this product, and so as it gets used, the resistant strains will outperform the susceptible ones, and the RSV ecology is likely to change \u2026 meaning its use will likely not last very long.\u201d\n\nACIP recommended adding Beyfortus to the childhood vaccine schedule, which would provide manufacturers a waiver of liability, but also recommended coding it as a drug for insurance purposes and leaving it out of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP).\n\nACIP ignores \u2018unrelated\u2019 infant deaths during Beyfortus clinical trial\n\nACIP member and CDC epidemiologist Jefferson Jones, M.D., MPH, said during Thursday\u2019s meeting, \u201cThe work group felt that RSV-associated disease in infants born, during, or entering their first RSV season is of public health importance.\u201d\n\nAlso during Thursday\u2019s meeting, clinical data regarding the effectiveness of Beyfortus was presented, indicating that it was \u201cup to 75% effective at preventing lower respiratory tract infections that required medical attention among infants and 78% effective at preventing hospitalization,\u201d CNBC reported.\n\nHowever, Jones acknowledged that \u201ca primary limitation\u201d in the clinical trial was that \u201cRSV testing may be more common for children with risk conditions inflating RSV-specific hospitalization rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, the evidence rating was very low certainty, and this was downgraded because of indirectness, because of the use of pharmacokinetic data as a surrogate for efficacy,\u201d he added. \u201cThe population did not include children that match the proposed indication outside of chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease \u2026 the study was small in size and \u2026 no placebo group was included for a comparison.\u201d\n\nSeveral infant deaths \u2014 12 in all \u2014 were reported during the clinical trial, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) claimed during a June review were \u201cunrelated\u201d to the antibody. On Thursday, Jones repeated this claim during the ACIP meeting, stating that \u201cno RSV-associated deaths were recorded.\u201d\n\nCNBC reported in June that of the 12 infants, \u201cFour died from cardiac disease, two died from gastroenteritis, two died from unknown causes but were likely cases [of] sudden infant death syndrome, one died from a tumor, one died from COVID, one died from a skull fracture, and one died of pneumonia.\u201d\n\nAnd STAT News reported in June that no data are available \u201cabout whether giving nirsevimab to a baby whose mother was vaccinated against RSV during pregnancy would give the infant more protection or would be a waste of the product.\u201d\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s meeting, Jones said, \u201cThe most commonly reported adverse reaction were injection site reactions at 0.3% and rash at 0.9%.\u201d\n\nAnd, further justifying the committee\u2019s subsequent unanimous vote, Jones cited data from an August 2022 University of Iowa and Rand Corporation study, stating that \u201c70% of respondents said they definitely or probably would get an RSV antibody injection for their baby if safe and effective.\u201d\n\nHowever, Jones also stated that \u201conly 33% of respondents thought their baby definitely or probably would get an RSV infection within one year after being born,\u201d according to data from the same study.\n\nNevertheless, Jones said at Thursday\u2019s meeting, \u201cThe work group determined that the target population probably feels that the desirable effects are large relative to undesirable effects.\u201d\n\nJones did acknowledge, however, that \u201cthe work group felt that the desirable consequences probably outweigh the undesirable consequences in most settings with a minority opinion that desirable consequences clearly outweigh the undesirable consequences,\u201d indicating at least a small amount of uncertainty among its members.\n\nBeyfortus label ignores adverse events, \u2018hardly worth the paper it is printed on\u2019\n\nNass also took issue with ACIP members downplaying the potential risks of Beyfortus and noted that Beyfortus\u2019 product label does not specify most potential adverse events associated with the drug.\n\n\u201cAccording to the label, the only risks specified are rashes and anaphylaxis. This is a very uninformative label. Hardly worth the paper it is printed on,\u201d Nass wrote.\n\nThe label does not provide any details about side effects,\u201d",

Less than two weeks into the Biden Administration and Democrats have already completely abandoned their inauthentic calls for \u2018unity\u2019 and \u2018bipartisanship\u2019 just to push through massive spending and get tax dollars to their buddies. You can\u2019t make this stuff up. These wasteful states just have their hand out to the federal government in hopes that American taxpayers will plug the long-standing holes in their budgets and pension systems created by decades of mismanagement and the poor decisions of failed politicians. That\u2019s not fair to Floridians and all the states around the country that have been working hard to protect taxpayer dollars. We can\u2019t let it happen.\u201d",

This budget resolution represents more of the same fiscal irresponsibility.

It\u2019s clearly not families on fixed incomes, like mine growing up, struggling to keep up with inflation and put food on the table with higher and higher costs. It\u2019s definitely not our businesses facing higher costs and a supply chain crisis fueled by Biden\u2019s failed policies and unconstitutional vaccine mandates. And it\u2019s obviously NOT our seniors depending on Medicare who will be left paying HUNDREDS more for the care they need. We need to be LOWERING health care and drug prices and strengthening this vital program for seniors and future generations, not crippling the system and leaving families to pay the cost. It\u2019s now clearer than ever that Democrats don\u2019t care who pays the price for their liberal wish list, they have their blinders on, following Bernie Sanders\u2019 socialist lead on an all-or-nothing multi trillion dollar tax-and-spending spree.

Do your own research if necessary, but at least be informed!\nBelow are the thoughts of Frank Schallenberger, MD regarding the Covid 19 vaccine.\nDear Patients and friends,\nLast week I must have been asked 20 times about the new COVID vaccines. Here are my thoughts. Please pass this informatiion onto many as you can. People need to have fully informed consent when it comes to injecting foreign genetic material into their bodies.\n1. The COVID vaccines are mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines are a completely new type of vaccine. No mRNA vaccine has ever been licensed for human use before. In essence, we have absolutely no idea what to expect from this vaccine. We have no idea if it will be effective or safe.\n2. Traditional vaccine simply introduce pieces of a virus to stimulate an immune reaction. The new mRNA vaccine is completely different. It actually injects (transfects) molecules of synthetic genetic material from non-humans sources into our cells. Once in the cells, the genetic material interacts with our transfer RNA (tRNA) to make a foreign protein that supposedly teaches the body to destroy the virus being coded for. Note that these newly created proteins are not regulated by our own DNA, and are thus completely foreign to our cells. What they are fully capable of doing is unknown.\n3. The mRNA molecule is vulnerable to destruction. So, in order to protect the fragile mRNA strands while they are being inserted into our DNA they are coated with PEGylated lipid nanoparticles. This coating hides the mRNA from our immune system which ordinarily would kill any foreign material injected into the body. PEGylated lipid nanoparticles have been used in several different drugs for years. Because of their effect on immune system balance, several studies have shown them to induce allergies and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, PEGylated lipid nanoparticles have been shown to trigger their own immune reactions, and to cause damage to the liver.\n4. These new vaccines are additionally contaminated with aluminum, mercury, and possibly formaldehyde. The manufacturers have not yet disclosed what other toxins they contain.\n5. Since viruses mutate frequently, the chance of any vaccine working for more than a year is unlikely. That is why the flu vaccine changes every year. Last year\u2019s vaccine is no more valuable than last year\u2019s newspaper.\n6. Absolutely no long term safety studies will have been done to ensure that any of these vaccines don\u2019t cause the cancer, seizures, heart disease, allergies, and autoimmune diseases seen with other vaccines. If you ever wanted to be guinea pig for Big Pharma, now is your golden opportunity.\n7. Many experts question whether the mRNA technology is ready for prime time. In November 2020, Dr. Peter Jay Hotez said of the new mRNA vaccines, \"I worry about innovation at the expense of practicality because they [the mRNA vaccines] are weighted toward technology platforms that have never made it to licensure before.\u201d",
