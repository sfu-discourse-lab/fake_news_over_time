But there is an important economic component to defeating Obamacare, as well. \"Implementation of Obamacare has played a major role in prolonging our country's economic challenges. Earlier this year, the head of the Congressional Budget Office testified before Congress that implementation of Obamacare would cost 800,000 jobs. Here in Florida, nearly 1 million Floridians are already out of work and the myriad regulations, taxes, and rules contained in Obamacare have only caused more worry and hesitation among the small-business men and women and job creators I've met with during the past three months, added Hasner. \"Individual liberty and limited government are paramount toward the defeat of Obamacare, but we should also never forget the incredible toll this massive overreach of government will take on our economic freedoms, as well. Getting Florida and America back to work requires expanding economic freedoms, and getting Washington regulations out of the way of job creators. There's no better place to start than by defeating Obamacare in the courts and repealing it in Congress.\"",

      "text": "\u201cI was dismayed by the spurious and completely false allegations made against me by Attorney Bob Christie of Shaheen & Gordon in a statement released today by the New Hampshire Democratic Party.\n\nNeither my attorneys nor I have had any contact with the New Hampshire Democratic Party since April 5th. The timing of this release is, thus, suspect to say the least.\n\nOn February 19, 2016, I contacted NHDP Chairman Buckley with a list of 10 detailed, demonstrably false allegations that had been disseminated by NHDP staffers and members of Carol Shea-Porter\u2019s campaign team and asked Chairman Buckley to help end the dissemination of these untruthful statements, which included the inexcusable lie, widely disseminated by the Shea-Porter campaign, that I am a perpetrator of domestic violence. It has now been clearly proven beyond any doubt that I am a survivor of domestic violence. Chairman Buckley refused to address any of these false allegations or mediate our resulting dispute with the Shea-Porter campaign.\n\nOn March 2, 2016, my attorney sent a detailed, 8-page letter to Chairman Buckley, the New Hampshire Democratic Party, Carol Shea-Porter and the Shea-Porter campaign outlining, again, in great detail the numerous false allegations being spread by NHDP staffers and the Shea-Porter campaign. This letter again detailed how the Shea-Porter campaign was spreading the lie that I am perpetrator of domestic violence. In addition, this letter, for example, documented how State Senator Donna Soucy (D-Manchester) made a ridiculous allegation to State Senator David Pierce (D-Lebanon), after he endorsed me. Senator Soucy told Senator Pierce that I had planned to purchase and place rats in the kitchen of the Puritan Backroom, a restaurant owned by Executive Councilor Chris Pappas (D-Manchester), a close associate of Chairman Buckley, and his family. I do not know where one would purchase rats nor do I know where the kitchen is in the Puritan Backroom. Furthermore, a simple review of the Backroom\u2019s health code records will reveal that the restaurant already has a long-standing problem with rodent infestations.\n\nI subsequently asked NHDP Vice Chair and State Senator Martha Fuller Clark, Gubernatorial Candidate Mark Connelly, among others, to stop this character assassination and mediate this dispute. They also refused. Only State Senator Jeff Woodburn would meet with my staff and me about this distressing situation to try and work towards a constructive solution. New Hampshire AFL-CIO President called to express his grave concerns about this situation and Chairman Buckley falsely indicated that he knew nothing about this character assassination or a potential lawsuit stemming from it.\n\nAt no point have my attorneys or I, in any way, suggested that I be paid to leave this congressional race. Furthermore, as Ms. Shea-Porter\u2019s campaign has constantly pointed out, I was very fortunate to be successful in business so the notion that I would engage in illegal activity for what, I can only suspect, would be a relatively small amount of money is ridiculous. Indeed, the only person who has ever suggested such a ludicrous idea was Mr. Christie in one of his last communications with my attorney, Mr. Clare. Mr. Christie also implied that the party would use its influence to have me arrested on spurious charges if I continued to assert my legal rights.\n\nWe consider Mr. Christie\u2019s accusations on behalf of the NHDP today defamation per se and will pursue our legal rights against the party. We have substantial correspondence and documentation supporting this and all the other statements made in this release which we will make public at the appropriate time.\n\nFinally, we have long contested that the NHDP has been violating Section E(1), specifically Subsections E(1)(j) and E(1)(h) of the state party\u2019s constitution (on which I relied in entering the party\u2019s primary). These sections of the party constitution require that the NHDP remain neutral in party primaries. Today\u2019s completely unprovoked attack on me serves as further proof that the party is supporting Ms. Shea-Porter and violating its own constitution. This is both undemocratic and un-Democratic.\u201d",

I and many others have been skeptical of the numbers put out by the consultants, and now our suspicions have been confirmed. The fact that the consultants did not factor in historic tax credits is puzzling. Additonally, the consultants have not factored in the significant amount of money that has been spent on consulting fees which have created a planning blueprint for Canalside. The master plan for Canalside does not involve a train station. Locating a train station at Canalside and throwing away these planning documents would be a waste of time and resources. Bringing the Central Terminal back to life will help to spark investment on Buffalo's East Side. A renovated Central Terminal will be a catalyst for economic growth, just as the Richardson Olmsted Complex has been for Buffalo's West Side. Looking at all the facts, we can see that the Central Terminal is the best choice for a new train station in the City of Buffalo.\"",

This is not just any old tax increase, it is a tax increase that falls squarely upon the shoulders of the poor, the middle class, and small businesses that can least afford to pay it. Even worse, this law increases the cost of care, puts government bureaucrats between patients and their doctors, and hurts the ability of private sector job creators in Ohio to give their workers the benefits they deserve. The voters of Ohio overwhelmingly rejected this one-size-fits-all approach last November, and I am confident they will do so again this November.\n\nWe can fix the problems in our health care system without a federal takeover and without a massive new tax on the poor and middle class. As Senator, I will fight for market-based solutions that allow patients to choose their doctor without government interference. I will fight to reduce the cost of insurance by increasing competition, encouraging innovative ideas like association health plans and health savings accounts, and reducing junk lawsuits that drive up the cost of everyone\u2019s medical care. The choice in this election is between taxing the uninsured to pay for a big government plan that takes away freedom and a free market plan that reduces costs, increases access to high quality care, and protects the relationship between doctors and their patients.\u201d",

It\u2019s unclear exactly when the vandalism happened.\n\nTwo vans from the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Department were on scene investigating the apparent vandalism Saturday at about 10 p.m.\n\nNeither the U.S. Secret Service nor the sheriff\u2019s department responded to inquiries from ABC NewsSaturday night.\n\nDonald Trump spent Saturday at Trump International Golf Club, according to the Tampa Bay Times, though it\u2019s not clear if he was on the course. Trump was at the club on Friday as well. The president is usually secretive about whether he actually hits the links or not.\n\nFox News host Sean Hannity and PGA golfer Dustin Johnson spent time with Trump at the golf club on Saturday as well, according to Palm Beach Post reporter George Bennett. Donald Trump Jr. shared a photo on Instagram of his daughter Kai with Johnson, the current world No. 1 player, and 2016 U.S. opener winner, on the course.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether any of the Trumps were at the club when the vandalism occurred.\n\nTrump opened the golf club in 1999, the first of what is now many courses in his portfolio. According to ABC News\u2019 analysis of public records of Trump\u2019s schedule, the president spent 109 days at one of his properties in his first year in office.\n\nThe president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate is just a 15-minute drive from Trump International.\u201d",

Notably, the newsletter provides no guidance on what the staff should do if an unborn baby is first registered for security purposes, but then aborted. On May 17, the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee plans to hold a hearing on the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 3803), which would generally prohibit abortion in the sixth month and later in the District. If the President wants to provide for the security of the unborn child immediately outside of the White House gates, as well as inside, he should endorse this bill.\"",

Doctors all across the nation have been complaining due to the overwhelming burden it places upon them. Just the time consumption alone, making sure these codes are accurate, will inevitably take time away from the doctor/patient relationship creating a barrier of paperwork while destroying the personal experience with your doctor. While these doctors are correct to state it will be even more of a burden, they are not correct to state this has come out of Obamacare itself. Let me explain. These codes were not created by Obamacare, however Obamacare is trying to implement every American citizen under international codes to link us to the international system. These codes were actually created by the WHO (World Health Organization) . The WHO is a specialized agency of the United Nations. [...] The questions that need to be asked and answered are: Why has the United States been subjected to International Medical Coding without our knowledge? Why are we allowing coding that goes against our principles and constitution? Why do we have a code for \"Legal Execution\"",

We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems.\n\nWe tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated.

Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as \u2018a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false \u201cnews\u201d stories\u2018.\n\nThe thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We don\u2019t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; It\u2019s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons.\n\nI think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?

The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror.

There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days. \nI have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria.

In that time we\u2019ve seen precious little action from Republicans to put people back to work.\nInstead, there have been power grabs, special interest payoffs and passage of an extreme, radical agenda that\ngives billions in tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations while sticking middle class and working families,\nchildren and seniors with drastic cuts to education and health care.\nThere are a handful of bills authored by Democrats that will really create jobs and help put people back to work\nincluded in the Governor\u2019s special session call.\nHowever, it appears that there will also be another attempt to rush through controversial, harmful legislation\nthat, for example, takes rights away from families and paves the way for environmentally destructive mining.\nMiddle class and working families need far more than what the Governor and legislative Republicans are\noffering today.\u201d",
